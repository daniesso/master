What good is that ?
The fact that I &apos;m here proves that I &apos;m innocent .
That &apos;s none of your business .
I can &apos;t eat this kind of food .
What do you think you &apos;re doing ?
What was left ?
Has Tom left yet ?

I just don &apos;t get it .
English is a Germanic language .
Tom and Mary were standing close to each other .
The coffee is very hot .
Tom relaxed .

I &apos;d like you to take this .

He is related to her by marriage .
I liked it a lot .
Tom put away his toys .
I &apos;m in love with you .
Do you need money ?
Can I speak to Tom ?
Tom is usually the last to leave , but last night Mary left ten minutes after he did .
Tom helps out as well .
For some reason , it &apos;s not working .
I don &apos;t care what happens .
My hobby is collecting coins .
He has his hair cut once a month .
I feel nothing but contempt for such dishonest behavior .
When Mary reached the bus stop , the last bus had already left .

Take us home .
What do you have to say ?
Don &apos;t worry about the results .
Tom pretended that it didn &apos;t matter to him that Mary was going out with John .
I &apos;m coming to Boston in October .
Please get the clothes in before it rains .
Nobody &apos;s watching us .
I see a red car ahead .

You &apos;re going to love this book .
Tom didn &apos;t speak French very well .
His dream came true .
They went crazy .
Where &apos;s the rest of it ?
I believe Tom can do that .

It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
I asked him if he knew my name .
Everyone laughed at me yesterday .
Why aren &apos;t you at school ?
Are you allergic to anything else ?
Tom let me stay for a night .
Tom has died .
It was the first time that I visited the museum .
He once owned a lot of land .
I walk my dog along the river every morning .
The lion opened its huge mouth and roared .
Do you think this is funny ?
I have things to do .
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died .
I can explain it all .
I don &apos;t think that I &apos;ll get there on time .
Nothing can prevent her from marrying him .
It would be inappropriate to discuss that now .
Did you know that he bought a condominium ?
What is today &apos;s date ?
Tom felt lonely .
Why do you say such horrible things about me ?
Perhaps we could do that tomorrow .
Tom is an accomplished writer .
Tom drank too much .
I bought two bags of popcorn .
Things got a little out of hand .
Tom is not often wrong .
Do you know a good way to learn new words ?
Don &apos;t worry about the results .
Did you mean it ?
I don &apos;t know where you are going .
Why should that be necessary ?
Come on . Let &apos;s go home .
To get good at something , you have to practice .
Show me what you can do .

He speaks English with a Russian accent .
You may see Tom there .
Did you clean your room ?
What do you have for breakfast ?
Can we talk about what happened that day ?
This statue is made of solid gold .
Do you like my new clothes ?
We don &apos;t want Tom to do that anymore .
Who could have spread that news ?
Don &apos;t be noisy in this room .
Tom has no choice .
Guess what I want to do now .
Do you want to help me ?
Do you think so ?
He has bought a new car .
How will you help Tom ?
Nobody was helping us .
The dust rose in clouds .
Tom might get sick .
Please read this carefully .
Think of your family .
Tom has a tendency to misplace things .
Tom told Mary he thought she wasn &apos;t a very good driver .
Tom saw what he thought was a gun in Mary &apos;s hand .
Tom felt humiliated .
Which one is mine ?
Tom rode his horse through the woods .
I love my parents .
It is cruel of him to say such things to her .
My father loves to travel by plane .
I &apos;ll teach you how to sing .
Ask Tom .
We have to figure out a way to make Tom do what we want him to do .
I know exactly where it is .
Tom and Mary are working on something together .
Let us know when you find out anything .
Tom hasn &apos;t read this book yet .
Tom couldn &apos;t completely rule out the possibility that Mary had killed herself .
I can &apos;t let this happen .
I finished the job yesterday .
I don &apos;t understand you people .
I felt a little stiff .
Tom goes to the same school as Mary .
You &apos;ll be very sorry .
You must be a fool .
Tom stole Mary &apos;s lunch money .
I had no friends except for Tom .
You don &apos;t have a clue .
I &apos;m right .
Are you still friends with them ?
Tom seems worried .
Tom wiped his hands on the dirty towel .
Something smells good . What are you cooking ?
I have a serious problem .
People can easily start loving , but not so easily stop .
I &apos;ve never seen you like this .
You don &apos;t want to make Tom mad , do you ?
We have no sugar .
I am sick and tired of him .
Can I count on you to do that ?
She left just as I arrived .
Tom got up from the table and went into the kitchen .
Police cordoned off the crime scene .
Don &apos;t be so angry .
There are holes in the roof .
America &apos;s Civil War lasted four years .
Tom drinks too much coffee .
We &apos;ve been trying to track you down .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy .
I didn &apos;t read any of those books .
We spent the entire day in the park .
Where can I get the airport bus ?
Who are you talking about ?
It was your child who tore my book to pieces .
We don &apos;t study French .
Let &apos;s share the expenses .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
The house has burnt down .
That bridge isn &apos;t long .
Give me your address .
Tom seemed a little jealous .
That &apos;s embarrassing .
Tom looked unkempt after not shaving for three days .
This looks good .
Have they reported it to the police yet ?
Somebody opened the door .
Do you have an appointment with him ?
Tom stole my wallet .
I got something in my eye .
I will explain it to her .
Do you feel any pain in your stomach ?
We &apos;ll look ridiculous .
What is the value of an average home in your area ?
I can teach you how to repair your car .
Mary dressed up as a witch .
Tom died of a drug overdose .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
Think outside the box .
The young soldier was confused .
I &apos;ll be sixteen on my next birthday .
She has no sense of duty .
It &apos;ll surely rain today .
She is always smoking .
How could you do that ?
Let &apos;s eat out tonight .
If someone paid you to kill Tom , would you ?
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d want from you .
We sang in loud voices .
He disclaimed all responsibility for the accident .
I &apos;m used to cooking for myself .
You can come and see me whenever it &apos;s convenient for you .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
The majority of his income goes to pay his rent .
What you said made everybody angry .
You can &apos;t do anything right now .
I want to go to America someday .
At last , we got to the lake .
The plane took off at exactly nine o &apos;clock .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom &apos;s ambitious .
The doctor wouldn &apos;t allow me to take part in the marathon .
Tom invited Mary and her sister to his party .
I used to be a cop .
I don &apos;t like both of them .
I &apos;m pretty sure it was Tom that I saw .
My brother paid double the price .
Seeing me , the baby began to cry .
She visited him in Boston .
How long can you hold your breath ?
Tom left his house before dawn .
Her eyes ran over the list to see if her name was on it .
Tom gave me a black eye .
Tom said that nothing like that would ever happen again .
I don &apos;t really want to bother you with my problems .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to start a lawn mower .
Tom asked for a glass of water .
How many minutes does it actually take to do that ?
He hid himself behind the door .
That &apos;s so sweet of you .
He &apos;s shorter than his father .
I have to report this .
I &apos;m starting to wonder if this was a good idea .
I &apos;m grateful to be alive .
Tom needs to do that as soon as possible .
The other day , I met him in Kyoto .
