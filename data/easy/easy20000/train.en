What time do you expect me to be there ?
When did you buy it ?
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gone swimming together in a long time .
No one wanted to be seen with Tom .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
I can &apos;t look at this anymore .
I don &apos;t know what to do about Tom .
Tom made many mistakes .
We are home .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
I was at school .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything since yesterday .
Thank you for coming , Tom .
Can I come over ?
He won &apos;t listen to me .
You can have either of these , but not both .
Tom is a hard person to please .
Tom said he saw Mary doing that .
When do we arrive ?
I think it &apos;s Tom .
Are you through with the book ?
I saw her at the station .
I won &apos;t buy that .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
Tom won &apos;t be here much longer .
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
We &apos;ve got everything we need .
It &apos;s very hard to understand .
There &apos;s something I have to tell you .
I can understand French better than I can speak it .
It isn &apos;t true .
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
I &apos;d rather not go home .
Tom , answer the door .
He just arrived .
Who told you I would help you ?
I didn &apos;t have a job .
They can &apos;t hear me either .
Tom isn &apos;t well .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom thought he would be late .
She kept me waiting for a long time .
That &apos;s not for Tom .
He admitted that it was true .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is here .
My mother is at home .
Tom &apos;s correct .
Let Tom stay .
Tom is a psycho .
Can I go to work ?
The bus will be here in a few minutes .
We &apos;re not listening .
Tom knew nothing .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
It &apos;s all very simple .
This is the boy .
Why did you listen to them ?
Why do I always have to do that ?
I barely know Tom .
The woman is beautiful .
I wish I had a dog .
I only wish to help .
We &apos;ve been here for a couple of minutes .
I really wish I could help .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
You &apos;re not Tom .
What book did you buy ?
I just have one question for you .
Tom got a letter from Mary today .
He made her his wife .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t do that .
It won &apos;t be easy .
The boy came back .
Do you want to come ?
I can speak to Tom .
I &apos;ll be back at ten .
Tom can talk .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
People believe what they want to believe .
This is good for me .
Tom and Mary want to tell us something .
I &apos;m busy all the time .
You &apos;re just like your father .
I don &apos;t think Tom is in Boston .
Give it to her .
It &apos;s not like I want you here .
Tom kept me waiting .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
Tom is good at driving .
Are you ready , Tom ?
That happens a lot here .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to do that .
I love you just the way you are .
Tom could hardly walk .
Tom and Mary had a lot of fun .
Tom is almost always correct .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
I want to be there .
I can &apos;t help you .
The work must be done by Tom .
He shut the door .
I wrote this book .
I think you &apos;re right .
Why is he here ?
This is none of your business .
Who &apos;s with Tom ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom could speak French .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever seen Tom do that .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
We don &apos;t know why he had to leave .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me earlier ?
I think Tom wants something to eat .
It &apos;s only a matter of time .
It seems that he &apos;s happy .
We all work .
There &apos;s something about Tom that I don &apos;t like .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Is his story true ?
Do you want me to leave ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do that .
No way !
Tom always looked happy , but never was .
He was home alone at the time .
That &apos;s for sure .
They don &apos;t like to do that .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
What does your son do ?
Tom should never do that again .
Is that your boyfriend ?
Tom was better .
That would &apos;ve been simple .
Aren &apos;t these your books ?
This isn &apos;t your house .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
The question is where to buy the book .
Is that a lot ?
Do you know where the money is ?
Tom can &apos;t come with us .
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
It &apos;s up to me .
I know how happy you are .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like that .
We &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
Don &apos;t you want to come along ?
Tom was really tired .
I can &apos;t believe he did that .
I &apos;m sorry , my father is out .
Tom told me he had no time to read books .
I &apos;m not going to ask again .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
I heard about it .
Tom knew that I was ready .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
You made a mistake .
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
There &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Tom still has many things to do .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
He &apos;s not sick .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mom .
It &apos;s great to have a family .
I think Tom should do it .
We can &apos;t go .
I &apos;ve said I &apos;m sorry .
You &apos;ve done it !
Tom and Mary want to go home .
We &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
I &apos;m going to study French .
Her story is true .
I was there last night .
Tom still hasn &apos;t eaten dinner .
Tom has done it before .
Give me that one .
I like your car .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
Tom told me that he was sick .
I want to be sure Tom is happy .
I &apos;m absolutely sure !
I have already finished this book .
Tell us something we don &apos;t know .
Tom knows that he needs to do something , but he &apos;s not sure what .
I want to do it .
They found this .
What did he do yesterday ?
He doesn &apos;t know any better .
Can he see us ?
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is .
He let us go .
I never forgot you .
I &apos;m not going to do that again .
If anyone comes to see me , say that I went out .
I really am sorry .
He talks fast .
Tom can &apos;t even ride a bicycle .
How &apos;s it coming ?
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
I never said I wasn &apos;t happy .
I &apos;ll take Tom to Mary .
Tom wouldn &apos;t know .
Are you at home ?
Can I have some of these ?
What can you tell me about it ?
Perhaps Tom will do that , too .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
Tom said he &apos;d do that for Mary .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
Do you have a sister ?
Do you mind if I ask why ?
I &apos;ll be around all day .
That &apos;s life .
He wrote a letter .
You must learn French .
Tom left a few minutes early .
I won &apos;t forget .
Tom bought a car last week .
Tom stopped talking .
I &apos;m here with Tom .
I didn &apos;t let them know .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
I &apos;ve never had to work very hard .
I &apos;d better go home .
No one saw that .
Tom may have to help Mary .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
What &apos;s Tom doing in Boston ?
Why does Tom want us to do this ?
I no longer need it .
You don &apos;t need to come so early .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
We &apos;ll never do it again .
I saw him .
Tom &apos;s not sick .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom not to come .
Tom wanted that .
I can speak French better than Tom can .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
Have you found anything ?
I don &apos;t have the time to read this book .
What did Tom write ?
It &apos;s time to go to school .
Tom will come later .
I told Tom I was tired .
We don &apos;t want you with us .
I feel very good .
He stopped talking .
Tom knows what you did .
She gave money .
Tom will need help .
I don &apos;t want to see it .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
I have some food .
I &apos;m sorry about what I said .
They should know it .
I &apos;m not tired yet .
You are one of us .
Tom is no longer afraid .
You can &apos;t stay for long .
I know that he was busy .
I have some money with me .
I came by bus .
How old is Tom ?
I want a friend .
I have one of those , too .
I do not love him any longer .
What happens next ?
This book is yours .
I said I &apos;ll be fine .
Can you come tomorrow ?
We prefer to stay here .
I think they &apos;ll understand .
I need to buy food , but I don &apos;t have enough money .
I know that .
I hope he &apos;ll get better soon .
What is the matter with you ?
I know how to do this .
What do they want with Tom ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
This is my job .
Tom looked a bit sick .
Let me see .
Is that the train I have to take ?
Is it there ?
What do you learn English for ?
Tom and Mary want a big family .
It won &apos;t last long .
They all look the same .
He always plays well .
I don &apos;t know if I can do this without you .
I can &apos;t say .
Have you told your mother ?
Tom has already gone to bed .
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
What does your sister do now ?
They want to know about Tom .
She is her friend .
You should &apos;ve let me help you .
We can &apos;t tell Tom .
You are a doctor .
Tom likes her .
You did what had to be done .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
I don &apos;t know that for sure .
Where did you buy your car ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like me ?
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
I think I made a mistake .
Why would Tom leave ?
I like this school .
I &apos;m leaving .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
A cat was on the table .
You ought to know that .
How was it ?
Tom looked around the room , but he didn &apos;t see Mary .
It &apos;s no longer available .
Why do we need to learn this ?
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
You need this .
I still love Mary .
He isn &apos;t like his brother .
I had fun doing this .
It is none of your business .
I don &apos;t like being alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go if he doesn &apos;t want to .
We &apos;ll take it .
Tom looked at Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything .
What is Tom eating ?
Tom intends to become a teacher .
I still don &apos;t know yet .
You have to come with me .
How often have you done that ?
Tom won &apos;t like it in Australia .
You are really very good .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
I thought I could count on you .
I &apos;m not over it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t need money .
Tom speaks French a little .
It &apos;s not the end of the world .
We can &apos;t help you now .
When was the last time you made your bed ?
What are you guys going to do today ?
It &apos;s part of life .
You learn fast .
Tell Tom you can &apos;t do that .
Tom is getting better .
Tom is going to be very good .
Who saw what ?
You &apos;ll have a hard time .
I had to help Tom do that .
I have a girlfriend .
Tom isn &apos;t coming .
Tom knew nothing .
I remember it very well .
That &apos;s possible .
He can drive a car .
I thought Tom was a doctor .
Tom wasn &apos;t gaining weight .
We didn &apos;t say anything .
You &apos;re in the way .
Tom is here to see you .
Tom is out .
Tom may not know French .
No one ever saw such a thing .
Tom needs something .
Tell Tom I &apos;d like to talk to him .
Tom never comes .
Who is this boy ?
You never say anything .
I &apos;m from Australia .
Is it the truth ?
I do like Tom .
Tom should eat .
I &apos;m not going back .
Tom is already here .
You have to take this .
I want Tom here .
That isn &apos;t good .
Please find Tom .
I have a problem with my car .
What did you say yesterday ?
I &apos;m not going .
I went to the station .
Tom is busy now .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
The dog walked across the street .
I need you in my life .
How about tonight ?
Who has it ?
If you wish , you can go .
I know both of them .
Tom looks tired this morning .
I never heard you play it better .
Is this car yours ?
It &apos;s not here .
When will we go home ?
Tom saw Mary at school .
What kind of book did you buy ?
I knew nobody would believe me .
I was out all day .
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
Who said that ?
Why am I here ?
You are really very good .
I was hardly able to see it .
Why didn &apos;t you come by bus ?
Tom has no friends .
Tom , I want to talk to you .
You should &apos;ve gone home already .
Tom did it right away .
Tom and Mary are the same age .
They want to help .
It &apos;s not like that .
How long &apos;s Tom been sick ?
I go to school every morning .
She came out of the room .
Nobody can help me .
I already know how to drive .
Tom always speaks in French .
Please wait five minutes .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
I made them myself .
She cannot have done such a thing .
The police will find us if we stay here .
Tom took Mary with him .
I don &apos;t think Tom saw us .
I stayed up all night .
He &apos;s still at work .
You should have seen it .
You should go .
It was that simple .
What did you tell Tom ?
I can &apos;t speak English at all .
He doesn &apos;t have any children .
I want to know why you did that .
We need this .
How exactly do you do that ?
Give me that book .
Tom was home all night .
Why are you so busy ?
Do you know where Tom works ?
Where &apos;s the girl ?
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary to do that .
I didn &apos;t see what happened .
I never had a girlfriend before .
I &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
I will have to be away for some time .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom and I work together .
Tom saw Mary .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
Are they busy ?
I think you should see a doctor .
Tom likes to go to Boston .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
I don &apos;t like this one .
We never go to Boston anymore .
Aren &apos;t you afraid ?
I made Tom go home .
May I go ?
What happened to my car ?
They soon became friends .
I don &apos;t know exactly .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
I know what Tom needs to do .
I want that to happen .
I can &apos;t find Tom . Has he gone already ?
You &apos;re not helping .
You must do it yourself .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
We don &apos;t get on well with each other .
I went to the police .
How much money do you have ?
She &apos;s not as tall as he is .
I &apos;m going to go see Tom .
I still have time .
I told Tom I &apos;m from Boston .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s wife like ?
Can the matter wait till tomorrow ?
I saw Tom do it .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about it .
He , and he alone , must go .
I think that we should forget about this .
It &apos;s just that simple .
Who &apos;s your mom ?
No one wants to talk about books anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
Tom told her .
You should have helped him with his work .
We need more food .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gone swimming together in a long time .
I don &apos;t need to do that if I don &apos;t want to .
Listen , I have to go .
Do you have any more questions ?
Why do you want to be alone all the time ?
I just want to talk to you .
It was a good answer .
I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
I left the house .
He was out of town last week .
Have you ever seen Tom eat ?
You may still do it if you want to .
We &apos;ve got something for you .
I know the problem .
Who gave you this ?
I made him do so .
The answer is anything but simple .
Tom is one person I &apos;ll never forget .
Her story can &apos;t be true .
Why aren &apos;t you here , Tom ?
That &apos;s not my car .
Tom never came .
Ask Tom not to wait for me .
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat .
We all know that Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
I thought Tom would meet Mary .
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
I could learn something from you , I think .
There are still people who cannot read .
I want to know how this happened and why .
Why don &apos;t we go out ?
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t know how Tom does it .
Do you want to leave now ?
We want to talk with Tom .
I want to be there with Tom .
I &apos;ll study French , too .
When did you finish writing the letter ?
No one is going to harm you .
He was all alone in the house .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like John .
I &apos;ll talk to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
You &apos;re my friend .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
That &apos;s how it should be .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
Tom is doing everything he can .
I want a lot more .
Tom &apos;ll come .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough money .
You may talk as much as you like .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
I want you to be by my side .
Do you know what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
What &apos;s your beef ?
My dog is white .
I know I &apos;m right .
What can &apos;t you do ?
I &apos;d like to study French , but I don &apos;t have the time .
What does Tom want you to do ?
They &apos;re listening .
Please let me know what you want .
Tom had three of them .
I &apos;m a busy guy .
Did you make it ?
We have to do this right away .
She is walking .
Where &apos;s your family ?
I &apos;ve just seen Tom .
I cannot help you .
Tom knows what that is .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t here .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I think he won &apos;t come .
I have to know why .
I can &apos;t remember his name .
Tom won &apos;t leave if you don &apos;t want him to .
I may be able to help you .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
Maybe I should just stay home .
I have everything .
When does Tom go to school ?
Let &apos;s get some lunch .
I should &apos;ve been ready .
I want to be a teacher .
When did you get home ?
It isn &apos;t that simple .
The girl doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
I can &apos;t get along with him .
I have something else I need to give you .
I need your help , Tom .
Who &apos;s standing ?
I don &apos;t think I know the answer .
I want to see it .
Are you here ?
Who &apos;s that girl ?
Do you have any children ?
We can &apos;t turn back now .
I &apos;m very sorry about this .
Tom is my mother &apos;s brother .
What does Tom know about this ?
Tom needn &apos;t have worried .
Why isn &apos;t Tom happy ?
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
There &apos;s nothing I want to say to you .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
I won &apos;t need you .
I can hardly hear you .
You made too many mistakes .
Tom is your brother , isn &apos;t he ?
You could &apos;ve asked me .
Tom knows that everything Mary is saying is true .
What I need is a friend .
I can do this alone .
Tom now lives with his dad .
I don &apos;t know how I should do it .
I never want to leave here .
Do you not want me here ?
What were you doing at that time ?
I &apos;d prefer not to do that today .
I want you to take me to Tom .
I have a girlfriend back home .
No one knows where he lives .
I &apos;ve got no worries .
Tom is very handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
He approached the door .
Do you have a sister ?
How shall I put it ?
I don &apos;t know exactly where .
We ended up going home early .
Is this what you want ?
We &apos;re all very worried about you .
Nobody knows why .
This is where the fun begins .
Why did you even bother to come ?
I know the whole story .
Tom is good at doing that , isn &apos;t he ?
Is this your dog ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
I think that &apos;ll do .
You &apos;d better go .
Tom isn &apos;t with us .
Can he speak French ?
I think you know I like you .
I have no home .
Tom isn &apos;t tall .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
Just let Tom go .
How many people work here ?
You must believe me .
He is old enough to understand it .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me .
My children don &apos;t speak French yet .
She likes him .
Tom really scared you , didn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t see any children .
We &apos;re just here to help .
He didn &apos;t know what to say .
This door won &apos;t open .
I &apos;m quite busy .
I was late to school .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
He seems to be sick .
I &apos;ll come by car .
This happens to us all the time .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
Where did you find these ?
Tom is more scared of Mary than she is of him .
We don &apos;t have anything to eat .
I think we should go .
I want to talk to the doctor .
I believe in Tom .
Tom and Mary have three children .
I have a lot of friends in Boston .
I really like this car .
Something has happened .
You should &apos;ve told the truth .
I know Tom likes you .
You can have as many as you want .
That &apos;s the way he likes it .
Where are we ?
Which one of you is Tom ?
Tom is not welcome in our home .
How much money do you have on you ?
Why do we have to do that ?
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
Give that back to me .
Tell me where I can find Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
I know exactly what Tom was doing .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I &apos;ll ask him if he will come .
She was at a loss for words .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here in Boston .
Tom stopped talking when Mary came into the room .
Tom knows that Mary likes him .
Tom is outside .
I told Tom to do that .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s not going to be that easy .
Tom and I &apos;ll do that .
I don &apos;t care what happens .
You &apos;re just a boy .
Can I ask you guys something ?
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
I will be back soon .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will go .
That one &apos;s good .
Tom is out here .
Can I count on you to do that ?
I don &apos;t want your help .
They do know what they &apos;re doing .
I ate something I wished I hadn &apos;t eaten .
This is not for me .
Tom didn &apos;t see anybody .
I guess it &apos;s time to leave .
I know that it &apos;s there .
I can &apos;t hear you .
Is that what you want ?
I &apos;m too busy to talk with Tom right now .
I &apos;m worried about Tom being alone .
We should do this again .
Do you want Tom ?
How am I going to do that ?
Tom can &apos;t hurt you .
Do you have a dog ?
Tom was afraid to swim .
Tom knew what Mary wanted to buy .
Tom isn &apos;t one of us .
You can &apos;t handle this alone .
Can you read this ?
Did you tell Tom that ?
He speaks too fast .
Tom gave us all the money he had on him .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
I love my son .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to swim .
I would like some more water .
Who is your dad ?
How long have you been in this town ?
He walked across the street .
When are they coming ?
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
We found one .
I don &apos;t mean you .
Tom found my bike .
What are you getting out of this ?
Tom did it .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
That does it .
He looks like your brother .
I won &apos;t do that again .
What were Tom and Mary doing at John &apos;s house ?
I might go swimming today .
I haven &apos;t been sick for the past three years .
How long are they ?
What &apos;re you guys doing later ?
I have never been to Boston .
Is Tom busy ?
Tom said Mary was too busy to help us .
Where are Tom and his family living now ?
I need your answer by the end of the day .
You &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
You know what Tom wants .
Tom was definitely busy .
How are you not seeing that ?
It takes three hours to get to Boston from here .
That &apos;s a good question .
Have you been in Boston long ?
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
Tom must be sick .
Tom was weary .
Can you stay for a few days ?
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
I have lots of things to do .
I &apos;m happy about that .
I heard that Tom has left his wife .
They may not be home .
Tom didn &apos;t buy it after all .
Tom isn &apos;t my father .
I should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to read this if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I &apos;m taking off now .
What was he up to ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy .
I didn &apos;t think it mattered .
We have been together for a year .
I don &apos;t know what they do .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here long .
Are these all Tom &apos;s books ?
Why is your French so good ?
Doesn &apos;t that look fun ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with him .
I just want to forget about it .
I need Tom &apos;s help .
Tom can &apos;t find his watch .
I must see it .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for Tom .
Tom saw us .
English is not easy for me .
Tom asked for my help .
We don &apos;t know how or why .
Can I see that one ?
Tom told me what you did .
Where does Tom do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t do anything .
We don &apos;t get out much .
Tom has a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
I can &apos;t help you with this .
Tom can &apos;t see us .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
I haven &apos;t had a reply to my letter .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s friend .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I &apos;ve never heard of him before .
Tom might still be living in Australia .
Tom won &apos;t do that again .
Tom isn &apos;t coming home with us .
Do you want to know his name ?
We were on the train for ten hours .
How am I supposed to eat ?
We &apos;ve lost them .
I need some of your time .
Tom and I have an understanding .
Tom wants to be like his father .
Is it really that simple ?
We &apos;re not going home .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
Let &apos;s go by car .
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
I will speak to you tomorrow .
Tell Tom that I need to talk to him .
Tom is in the house .
I think he likes you .
I know how difficult this must be for you .
Don &apos;t show your face around here again .
I didn &apos;t want to let Tom into my house .
I would like to tell you something .
The problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
I can do without it .
I want to be a teacher when I grow up .
I won &apos;t be coming to school anymore .
You will need time to understand .
Tom went downtown .
Tom and his wife are from Australia .
I got into town only a week ago .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We can do it ourselves .
I have something to give you .
Tom gave it to me .
Tom took off his watch .
Keep the kids inside .
Tom is still here .
These aren &apos;t for you .
Tom almost looks like a girl .
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is now .
Tom is very busy .
The job &apos;s not done yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is busy or not .
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
She needs you .
Where can I get some help ?
I &apos;m sure that it &apos;ll be fun .
You &apos;ll have to work a lot .
Everybody has already left .
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him .
I &apos;d rather take the bus .
We don &apos;t need you .
I met him at the station .
Tom will tell you the truth .
I think I &apos;ve been here before .
She really needs your help .
There is no answer to your question .
I like them .
He &apos;s not home .
Let Tom do it .
I thought Tom had something to tell you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is here .
I &apos;ll leave you two alone .
I love your car .
Isn &apos;t that what you said ?
I don &apos;t think I want to study French with you .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
He &apos;s really good looking .
Where is the boy ?
Who are you and why are you here ?
I &apos;m going home now .
Do you have a big family ?
I am tall .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
I believe in always telling the truth .
Tom got there long after we did .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
Did Tom go alone ?
It &apos;s not from me .
There &apos;s somebody who wants to meet you .
Nobody saw Tom .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning .
Can I talk to Tom , please ?
No one knows what happened .
You can go if you want to .
I can &apos;t work with Tom .
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
He is tall .
You know that I like you .
He came .
You have to ask Tom first .
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
I lost a lot of money .
Tom seems pretty happy .
Where can we buy it ?
I &apos;m often here .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go home .
I should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
I think I &apos;m just tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand .
We &apos;re not exactly sure what it was .
I &apos;m going to give you something .
How &apos;s the world treating you ?
Why aren &apos;t you with your parents ?
Has he arrived already ?
Maybe you should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
Do you know how old I am ?
I know Tom would love to see you .
I am very happy with it .
What time will Tom arrive in Boston ?
I &apos;ll catch up with you later .
I can &apos;t say exactly .
This is life !
Tom looked tired .
I know what Tom wants .
Can we go ?
That &apos;s what my mom keeps telling me .
I intended to have finished the work .
We &apos;ve come home .
He &apos;s really quick .
Why are people afraid of you ?
What is it you need ?
I &apos;d like to see you .
I just don &apos;t love Tom .
Somebody was in the house .
He asked me whether she was coming .
I prefer my own company .
What &apos;s wrong with you two ?
I go to work .
You &apos;ll see Tom .
We met last night .
What are you two up to ?
Tom wandered off .
I &apos;m fine .
It has nothing to do with you .
Have you seen this man ?
I know Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;ve lost it .
There is still much more to be done .
Are you sure that you want to do this ?
What are you planning to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
Tom is going to like being in Boston .
Tom is much better than you .
You can &apos;t leave me .
I don &apos;t want to do that , but I have to .
She says that she is happy .
We have finished the work for today .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
I don &apos;t think he can help you .
When will it be ready ?
We &apos;re waiting for Tom .
They lost .
We have very little time .
No one knows .
It had to be done .
Won &apos;t it keep until later ?
I &apos;ll talk to Tom later about this .
Tom understands what needs to be done .
What Tom has told you is true .
Is Tom still around ?
No one knew about it .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
I think those are Tom &apos;s books .
My mother can &apos;t come .
Tom made Mary happy .
Tom spent a lot of time with Mary .
Why does Tom want to go there ?
It &apos;s bedtime .
You can ask me anything you like .
I didn &apos;t have to do anything .
No one likes it .
I think this is good .
I should have listened to Tom .
This is not for you .
Tom did it for fun .
We have no need for assistance .
I &apos;m going to be a father .
Let &apos;s buy this one .
I think Tom said that .
Tom looks like his mother .
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
We &apos;ll see you .
I have often been there .
It wasn &apos;t hard to understand .
Tom isn &apos;t here , is he ?
You know better .
I &apos;m a busy guy .
I &apos;m just about done .
How many people work here ?
Tom is inside the house .
We don &apos;t have much time .
Tom can speak French as well .
You &apos;re not alone .
Tom is afraid of me .
I can &apos;t meet Tom now .
Why do we have to help Tom ?
Tom and Mary need help .
He gave it a new name .
That &apos;ll be fine .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
What ? What did you say ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat out as often as they used to .
Those are their books .
Who do you think it is ?
We &apos;ll go home .
We just need money to do it .
You never know .
What can I do for you ?
He often comes late .
Tom is in Australia already .
You can &apos;t help me .
Tom is going to need my help .
I have to wait .
I found Tom .
Tom eats anything .
May I help you ?
Where did everybody go ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom is now .
Don &apos;t say that word ever again .
It happened in Boston .
I went to her house , but she was not at home .
I saw Tom do that .
Tom and Mary look happy .
Tom said that Mary likes you .
She doesn &apos;t like going to school .
I should &apos;ve stayed at home today .
How does he do this ?
People who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t have to .
Tom might know .
Tom said that &apos;s what he wants to do .
We want to know .
I really enjoyed this book .
The story is good except that it is a little too long .
I know it isn &apos;t always easy .
We &apos;ve seen them .
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
Tom may be home .
Tom came home very late .
Tom spends a lot of money on books .
Tom asked for money .
How many times has Tom been here ?
I am too busy to go .
Tom is about to do that .
If that happens again , I &apos;ll leave .
You had better not read this book .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer his question .
Tom would tell us the truth , wouldn &apos;t he ?
My children don &apos;t speak French .
What &apos;s going on , Tom ?
Tom said goodnight .
Tom &apos;s happy .
I &apos;ve heard quite a lot about you .
Tom said that , too .
Give me a few .
Don &apos;t you want to go with us ?
Tom is walking towards Mary .
What do I need to do ?
I &apos;ll give that to Tom .
I may not do that .
I asked where Tom was .
Did you like Boston ?
Tom had many friends .
Tom can &apos;t speak any French .
I &apos;ll get one .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
They &apos;ve been out there a long time .
I know this must be very difficult for you .
I &apos;ll help you all I can .
Don &apos;t say it again .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
This dog isn &apos;t mine .
Please don &apos;t speak French here .
Tom is looking at it .
You know I can &apos;t .
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
I &apos;ve got to see you .
What is it that Tom wants ?
I think about him often .
Tom says he wants to do that .
She took her book .
What did that suggest to you ?
There are a lot of people who can &apos;t do that .
Tom is very happy .
Please don &apos;t try this at home .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with Tom .
Isn &apos;t the answer easy ?
How can I get to the police station ?
I &apos;d like to help you .
Why do you say things like that ?
Do you know how ?
Tom needs you here .
Are you out of work ?
What has Tom done now ?
I &apos;ve been working .
I need to talk to you about what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow .
I know it well .
That &apos;s not what I want .
Let Tom know we &apos;ve got a problem .
Is this Tom &apos;s room ?
I &apos;m not sure about this .
Where did you hear that ?
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
We &apos;re going with you .
I want to stay here with you .
Tom looks like he wants to say something .
This is a book .
What was I supposed to say ?
What else ?
Can you drive ?
Give me your watch .
Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
I love French .
We &apos;re not going to Boston .
I gave Tom my word .
No one likes you .
He did not speak at all .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that .
Do you have any good books for children to read ?
I don &apos;t want to leave Tom .
That &apos;s your problem .
I always have something to do .
What are they doing out here ?
He was at home .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom until he gets back .
That has nothing to do with you .
They know we &apos;re out here .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
Tom is not one of us .
What &apos;s it like being Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Tom isn &apos;t my friend anymore .
That &apos;s not what I said .
What &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
She needs it .
I went there .
Where does Tom have to do that ?
What is it that you want , Tom ?
You will be able to see him tomorrow .
I know how we can help .
I want Tom to like you .
Tom knows what we did .
I can do that .
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
You &apos;ve got to let me go .
Tom might never speak to me again .
You don &apos;t seem to be enjoying yourself .
I think he is right .
Maybe I don &apos;t need Tom .
I know Tom would love to see you .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
Why do you want Tom ?
Tom knows that we know .
They &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
This isn &apos;t my car .
That book is mine .
Who saw me ?
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he comes home .
What does Tom want to eat ?
You should come with us .
I &apos;m going to do it for you .
He made for home .
I asked Tom why he did it .
My book is very heavy .
Tom should talk to me .
Why are you doing this to yourself ?
I thought Tom was sick .
I love my cat .
The job is as good as done .
I don &apos;t like the house which he lives in .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know you .
I want to stay a few days .
I &apos;m already tired .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
Tom is really big .
Here &apos;s a letter for you .
It makes me very happy .
I want money .
They want something from us , but I don &apos;t know what .
He is very sick .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to do .
Why did you do that ?
We &apos;ll drive .
I won &apos;t hurt you .
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Tom is really sorry .
Please just tell me what &apos;s going on .
Can I talk to you ?
I know that Tom is tired .
I &apos;m certain that he &apos;ll come .
He is afraid of becoming sick .
What have you done ?
You know where Tom is .
You must tell us .
What does this have to do with Tom ?
I still have to do that .
I have something that I want to say to you .
I &apos;ve got friends in Boston .
What about you ?
I know I have a lot to learn .
The window is closed .
May I leave now ?
How old are you now ?
Can I ask why ?
Tom bought a dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
Tom would love to see this .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it better .
I &apos;m still busy .
I want to know where it is .
I believe I have now told you everything .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
I gave him a few books .
What &apos;s Tom wearing ?
There &apos;s no one in the house . They &apos;re all outside .
He &apos;s already left .
I want the other one .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary anything about that .
I have to go to bed .
When will he come ?
Tom knew something .
No one knows that I like you .
I &apos;ll be back within two hours .
I &apos;m not to blame .
We &apos;re happy to be here .
I had a good time .
School &apos;s not fun .
Here you are .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
I want that car .
I &apos;m going to Boston .
Why do I have to do that ?
I &apos;m sorry , my father &apos;s not here .
Have you told your parents ?
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom saw us do that .
I know exactly where you are .
That includes everything .
I bought many books .
What is it with you and Tom ?
Why do you learn English ?
I know what Tom is doing .
Tom did it for money .
Are you sure about this ?
Tom made many mistakes .
I &apos;m alone with Tom .
Tom says he &apos;ll do whatever we do .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
We &apos;d better wait until tomorrow .
Tom wasn &apos;t eating .
Tom already left .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
This is how it happened .
Tell Tom why you didn &apos;t do that .
We had so much fun together .
We are all in agreement .
We didn &apos;t do it for Tom .
I can &apos;t do what you want .
We haven &apos;t got much time .
It can &apos;t be Tom .
Tom should go help Mary .
We &apos;re going to Boston for a week .
The children rarely go outside .
That &apos;s what I think , too .
It &apos;s all Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;m not sure whether I really want that .
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
You &apos;ll have a rough time .
Tom won &apos;t stay .
I am busy .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
I don &apos;t want to be here .
Everyone &apos;s reading .
Tom has a job .
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
Can I speak with Tom ?
You should have one of us do it .
That must be my book .
Tom had questions .
Tom ought to do that .
How can I get to the train station ?
I &apos;m not going to live here .
Tom and Mary look good together .
Tom and Mary both want to say something .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that .
Nothing scares me .
I know that Tom is a doctor .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
Tom isn &apos;t so tall .
I know some of these girls .
You &apos;re going to have to do that .
How many times do I have to tell you this ?
Tom arrived earlier than I did .
I can &apos;t find Tom either .
This is the end of my story .
I &apos;d like to go home .
I have to see this .
Everyone has been there .
We &apos;ll have to do it even if we don &apos;t want to .
You look very beautiful today .
I &apos;ve eaten enough .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
He seems as busy as ever .
This clock isn &apos;t working .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t here .
Tom didn &apos;t have time .
See you .
I should go help Tom .
I &apos;ll go and see Tom .
I &apos;m not your husband anymore .
Tom said that Mary may do that .
Where is the cat ?
I think it &apos;s going to be fun .
Tom is busy .
Tom wondered what he was supposed to do .
I &apos;m not so sure now .
My sister is pretty .
We don &apos;t want your money .
I can speak French .
What do you want to do now ?
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom is a very good man .
Who did what ?
Please don &apos;t look at me like that .
I &apos;ll do that for Tom .
If Tom really liked me , he wouldn &apos;t have done that .
This table is in the way .
Tom has a brother in Australia .
I &apos;ll be here .
Why do you have to do that ?
Tom was also there .
I want to see that .
He is a good doctor .
Didn &apos;t you write him a letter ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t want this .
I must know the truth about Tom .
We study French .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
How are you these days ?
What can you tell me about Tom ?
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
You know who I am .
Do you want to know the truth ?
He doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
I &apos;m going to do it again .
Tom bought Mary a car .
I don &apos;t know why you want me to do that .
I need to know everything there is to know about Tom .
Tell us who you are .
Tom wants to know who Mary &apos;s boyfriend is .
I don &apos;t know where Tom will do that .
I think Tom knows why .
Tom came too early .
How would I know where Tom is ?
We know that .
Tom has to go .
I hope Tom comes soon .
That &apos;s all .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
Tom is feeling a little bit better today .
Do you know where you are , Tom ?
I want to stay .
I know you &apos;re right .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
Tom is going home .
You don &apos;t look so good .
I want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom hasn &apos;t written to me in a long time .
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;ll have to go home now .
I need you to drive me to the station .
He &apos;s got enough money to buy a house .
Tom will come soon .
Ask yourself why .
You &apos;re no longer children .
Let &apos;s not talk about that now .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
I have it at home .
What &apos;s it like ?
Has Tom gone , too ?
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary .
I was told Tom would be here .
Let me go just once .
He couldn &apos;t bring himself to believe her story .
We &apos;ll do what we have to do .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here ?
He eats a lot .
You can wait for me here .
It &apos;s already late .
I am a man .
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
I &apos;m here again .
She was a great help to me .
Did Tom eat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to work .
I &apos;m very good at swimming .
Who gave you this ?
Tom is avoiding me .
That &apos;s what I need to do .
Tom has a new girlfriend .
It &apos;s about time I was going home .
We &apos;re not going , are we ?
You look busy .
We &apos;re going back to Boston .
Tom said something .
Why are you working for Tom ?
He will be here soon .
I think I &apos;ll like being here .
This is his car , I think .
You had better go to bed now .
He told the truth .
A woman asked me for directions .
Does Tom know how to drive ?
Leave that there .
I don &apos;t have to go .
Why don &apos;t you go alone ?
Tom walked back into the house .
I &apos;m sorry for you .
Teachers must understand children .
We can do it right now .
It seems that she was ill .
I don &apos;t want to study .
I should have done this years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
The man is old .
Tom tends to be late .
Tom isn &apos;t there , is he ?
I don &apos;t want to be like that .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
I was tired .
I &apos;ve seen that , too .
Tom needs you .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I &apos;m certain I saw Tom .
He &apos;s my brother .
She herself gave him something to eat .
Who wrote this letter ?
I didn &apos;t write that .
Are you here alone ?
Did they say what happened ?
I want a family .
You know what you must do .
He is here !
She needs to help him .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
You know what Tom wants .
That should be kept between us .
Tom knows that &apos;s no good .
This book is hard for me to read .
I can &apos;t see it .
Has this ever happened to you before ?
I didn &apos;t say anything .
I &apos;ve eaten .
Please tell me how to do that .
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
We know what you want .
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
Tom made coffee .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that again .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do it .
It seems like we have to go now .
Tom had a dog .
I never think about it anymore .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
I &apos;m very happy in Boston .
How &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
This is what I want to do .
What kind of help do you need ?
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
The train hasn &apos;t come yet .
Did you see him at the station this morning ?
I just found it .
I want what &apos;s mine .
I am not well at all .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
Nobody saw Tom do it .
This is not for me .
She appears to have a lot of friends .
We need to take Tom home .
I would like that .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
Why am I going ?
You have to help me .
I &apos;m never eating here again .
We never forget .
How old are your kids ?
Tom will be here .
I found out what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I think that Tom is sick .
Did Tom tell you ?
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
You work too much .
Why are we even talking about this ?
She handed him a book .
I have a question for Tom .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
I really liked talking to Tom .
Have Tom do it .
How was I dressed then ? Do you remember ?
How am I going to do that ?
Do you have any questions ?
Have you had dinner ?
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
Tom said Mary is good at French .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing .
I want to know your opinion .
I do not know where to wait for her .
I met him once .
I heard something .
You know what I want , don &apos;t you ?
She stopped talking .
I think Tom should see this .
I still don &apos;t see it .
You don &apos;t want this .
I want them .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll come .
We &apos;re still friends .
I &apos;ll know tomorrow .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
He &apos;s still at work .
Tom is just a kid .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
Tom knows where to find me if he needs me .
Is your mom at home ?
Why did you say that to Tom ?
May I speak to you ?
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
We regret doing that .
Tom can do it better than I can .
I &apos;m not sick .
Tom isn &apos;t back yet .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Tom wants to know the truth .
He walked rapidly .
You don &apos;t scare me .
Tom &apos;s busy .
Let &apos;s meet Tom .
You gave it to us .
I know what &apos;s up .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
Tom seems to enjoy speaking French .
What &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Tom wants to learn to swim .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me to do that .
My sister likes Tom .
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
Someone has been in my room .
I only have a week to get this done .
Tom works for Mary &apos;s father .
I think I won &apos;t go to work today .
I &apos;d like to hear a story .
It is time to go .
It could &apos;ve been better .
May I help you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that this morning .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to meet you .
Tom can &apos;t come , because he &apos;s sick .
No one speaks with me .
Tom asked me if I were happy .
That &apos;s what I hope .
If you want to talk , let &apos;s talk .
Did Tom give you something for me ?
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
We &apos;re not where we want to be .
It &apos;s none of your business .
Tom can &apos;t work this evening .
Tom and Mary have gone .
Where are your people ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
That &apos;s a question no one knows the answer to .
Have you finished it ?
I wish I could understand you better .
I want you to be my friend again .
Tom may have been there .
Don &apos;t be sorry .
Tom has a son named John .
She looked me in the eye .
If only I had left home five minutes earlier .
We &apos;ll take Tom with us .
She speaks English really well .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
Did you hear that ?
I didn &apos;t hear you .
I really enjoyed that .
You know who I am , don &apos;t you ?
Tom wrote a letter .
Is there anything for me ?
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
There &apos;s no water .
Who bought you this ?
Tom and Mary must really like each other .
I &apos;m all right .
Did Tom say why he wasn &apos;t coming ?
They don &apos;t know what they should do with the money .
Tom wanted his money back .
I don &apos;t think this is for you .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
I &apos;ll do what I can .
You can rely on him .
School is over .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
I will give her the book tomorrow .
Where do you work ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t have said that .
How long have you been in here ?
I will give you this book .
Nobody ever found her cat .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
I didn &apos;t stay there very long .
I &apos;m coming back .
He pretended to be a doctor .
Tom really needs your help .
Tom got home .
I know Tom &apos;s sister .
I know what Tom likes .
You won &apos;t get rid of me that easily .
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
That &apos;s easy to say , but it &apos;s not easy to do .
We &apos;re in Australia now .
I &apos;ll be there right away .
Tom and Mary both have very few friends .
I &apos;m going to stay at home tonight .
Are you able to swim ?
Tom didn &apos;t know how old Mary was .
Tom looks very good .
I go to bed very early .
Tom kept going .
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d like you to be there .
How many people are there ?
Tom never talks about his work .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
I know nothing about you .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
Tom gets tired easily .
I love my wife .
Tom was in Boston last week , wasn &apos;t he ?
I need this back by tomorrow .
Are you through with the book ?
What exactly did you do ?
Maybe Tom can help you .
Tom knows what Mary said .
Tom left quickly .
I tried to help him .
What if he doesn &apos;t want to talk to me ?
What &apos;s wrong with these people ?
We have a lot of work to do .
That belongs to my brother .
Tom eats too fast .
She has a lot of friends here .
Things weren &apos;t always easy .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Have you found anything ?
I suppose I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
We &apos;re quite tired .
You can do that tomorrow .
We &apos;ll go a week from today .
Tom had never been so busy before .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
She &apos;s beautiful .
It isn &apos;t what I thought .
I have money enough to buy it .
What is truth ?
Tom talks about Boston a lot .
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
Nobody can help you .
Tom said that he had been busy .
I &apos;ll be home late today .
We need to know what happened .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
Did you see her there ?
That one &apos;s for me , too .
I can do this all night .
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
I &apos;m here .
All we need is a little more time .
Why would I do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry anymore .
Tom asked Mary if she had a dog .
Are you through with this book ?
I had nothing to do with it .
I &apos;ll come home .
Tom wants to live .
It isn &apos;t easy .
Tom and Mary were here .
Please tell me the truth .
I hope he &apos;ll be able to come ! I &apos;d like to see him .
Tom may be studying French .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
What would you like to have ?
I think that Tom should stay .
You should stay in bed .
We really need a man like you here .
Why did you not go to Boston ?
I can &apos;t swim at all .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
Did you really do that ?
We want Tom .
I think Tom knows what to do .
I &apos;m still not sure what you mean by that .
She likes the teacher .
Where did Tom see you ?
You ought not to say such a thing .
What does Tom want from me ?
I think Tom likes it .
Is this Tom ?
I &apos;m busy right now , Tom .
You have done very well .
I &apos;ll be alone .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet whether he &apos;ll go or not .
Tom isn &apos;t good at French .
It was almost too good to be true .
That makes me happy .
What did Tom tell Mary to do ?
I could hardly tell who was who .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to tell Tom .
My sister is very fond of children .
Tom knows more .
I &apos;ll come back soon .
You know enough .
Where is my brother ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat .
He asked me whether I was busy .
You can tell me the truth .
Tom is too busy .
She is not afraid of anything .
Do you have a family ?
I remember how he used to be .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
Tom was in Boston last week .
Please don &apos;t go .
She is everything to him .
I &apos;m like Tom .
You can &apos;t do this .
You are a teacher .
They may go .
Do you know how Tom does that ?
I know why he did it .
That &apos;s what she said .
This is his house .
I don &apos;t have all day .
When do you need it ?
I feel perfectly fine .
Tom is very old .
Please go .
That &apos;s not true either .
Tom is not my son .
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
Tom is having dinner .
Tom is back again .
I love you the way you are .
They want to go home .
Do you have kids ?
I don &apos;t want to drive .
I am here .
She pretended to know nothing about it .
Didn &apos;t you hear her speaking French ?
I &apos;d love to know everything about you .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time .
I know that , Tom .
I think Tom might like that .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
You ought to have known better .
I still haven &apos;t heard from him .
What does Tom want to eat ?
He could speak French .
Tom is going to be here .
How will I find it ?
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;ve never done it this way before .
I can &apos;t believe I forgot .
I only wanted to be helpful .
Tom is too tired to study .
Everyone is talking about it .
Did they say why ?
I hope Tom likes me .
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come yet .
I can hardly hear you .
I never want to talk to you again .
I never had a car .
Tom could help you .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
I &apos;m so sorry to hear that .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at home ?
Tom feels a little sorry for Mary .
Tom may not be in Boston .
I &apos;m very happy about that .
You must tell us .
Tom wished Mary was with him .
Let &apos;s eat out .
What does Tom want from us ?
My father is home .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
How did you guys find me ?
We &apos;re parents .
I &apos;ll give these to Tom .
Nobody knows where Tom is .
Tom &apos;s family was also there .
Aren &apos;t you going to do it ?
We have three children .
I thought he was my brother .
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
I &apos;ll give that to you .
Tom used to do that .
You &apos;re safe now .
Were you going to the railway station when I saw you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
The house has been bought .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
He is as old as my father .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes you .
Tom was often late for school .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
Tom is your friend .
That girl looks like Mary .
Tom is there .
Why don &apos;t we get going ?
Tom and Mary are waiting for the bus .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
He told me that he was busy .
It &apos;s all very simple .
You won &apos;t believe what happened .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
They don &apos;t want us to know .
Tom knows how to do that .
Why are Tom and Mary here ?
Tom and I don &apos;t want that .
Tom may be doing that .
I know what &apos;s going on .
Tom works all night .
She walks .
It &apos;s a big world .
What &apos;s your location ?
I gave that to Tom .
It may be that he likes his job .
He has a sister and she goes to school , too .
I think I &apos;m OK .
Why does Tom do that ?
He does nothing but play all day .
I &apos;m really busy at the moment .
She is going to learn how to drive .
You might not find it .
We have nothing .
Why are you at home ?
Do you have anything further to say ?
Tom speaks no French .
You &apos;re not a child anymore .
Tom was alone in the room .
Tom has made many new friends .
I would like to eat something .
I don &apos;t want to play .
You have to live here .
Tom is busy .
How did you get into my room ?
How often do you come to Boston ?
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
Did you write this book ?
He can no longer wait .
There &apos;s nobody at the door .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
Tom and Mary are no longer together .
I &apos;m very busy today .
We need your help .
Tom knows .
I &apos;d almost forgotten .
I &apos;ve never done it like that before .
I &apos;ll never see her again .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
I &apos;m going to school .
That sometimes happens .
Tom seems quite busy .
You don &apos;t have to stay to the end .
I &apos;ve only had one girlfriend .
What does he see ?
My father made me what I am .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that sort of thing .
That was fun .
She and I are the same age .
I want to see my parents .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is now .
When did it occur ?
There are many books in my room .
Tom says he hopes Mary will be able to do that tomorrow .
Maybe we just weren &apos;t meant to be together .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
I &apos;ve got no money left .
He did it for the money .
How did you come by that much money ?
I &apos;m sure that she &apos;s correct .
This is it .
Where did you find these ?
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
Can &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
It should be like this .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
Tom is here for you .
This car is Tom &apos;s .
Tom won &apos;t tell me exactly why he was late .
We &apos;re all happy .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me you were here .
Tom said that he was fine .
Tom needs you here .
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
I think Tom wants to see you .
Tom is coming with us .
Are Tom and Mary with you ?
They let me go .
That &apos;s what Tom said , too .
Tom saw me do that .
I won &apos;t be home for a week .
You know I can &apos;t .
I heard you talking to Tom .
He told me that his father was a doctor .
Can this wait until tomorrow ?
Did you find a job ?
Did you come by car ?
I &apos;ve never heard of such a thing .
What do you want to hear ?
That &apos;s what made me happy .
Tom and Mary are afraid of John .
He is liked by everybody .
We don &apos;t need you .
Kids don &apos;t read books anymore .
Tom is a total nutcase .
It &apos;s what I want .
My children are in school .
Please think about the problem .
What will become of me ?
Tom didn &apos;t hear Mary enter the room .
I don &apos;t even think about it anymore .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand Tom .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
Tom can speak French a little .
Tom likes money .
Where &apos;s my husband ?
You can &apos;t go yet .
Where should Tom go ?
There &apos;s no one there .
Ask your dad to help you .
This is what he said .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
Just tell the truth .
I can be there in ten minutes .
She asked him how to get to the station .
I wanted more .
This has never happened before .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears .
Tom ate out .
You have to help .
It &apos;s not a problem .
Do you know what I like ?
What do you do with these ?
They &apos;re not like us .
That &apos;s what I want .
Something may have happened to him .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
There &apos;s something I need to give you .
I might be able to help you .
I forgot what I was going to say .
Who are you ?
I &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
I need to know by tomorrow .
I thought about Tom .
I know French .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
My son is now as tall as I am .
It is up to you .
That happens every day .
He gets tired easily .
Is your mom home ?
Can I do anything for you ?
Girls talk too much .
They &apos;re watching .
Tell Tom yourself .
How good a swimmer is Tom ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re welcome here .
Tom did what he had been told .
I asked Tom to leave .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom is not on good terms with his family .
I know where that is .
Why are these people here ?
Tom wasn &apos;t here when I came in .
They never did anything .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
Tom is going to have to do that .
The man at the door wouldn &apos;t tell me his name .
Have you written a book ?
We don &apos;t have a car .
I didn &apos;t see Tom at all yesterday .
I &apos;ve found a job .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
It was just a matter of time .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew French ?
He looked very happy .
Tom is able to speak French .
I won &apos;t leave .
We &apos;ll meet again .
I beg you to help us .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary .
I asked him to do that .
I wish I was with you .
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
I don &apos;t know why people do that .
They &apos;re doing it now .
I had to study English .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
My dog is big .
I come to Boston quite a lot .
Have you ever seen Tom do that before ?
You need to go .
May I speak to you ?
I know your brother .
Tom couldn &apos;t walk .
I am going to write a letter tomorrow .
This book is written in French .
Let me have a look at it .
We should do this every day .
Tom won &apos;t forget this .
Please don &apos;t get up .
Tom won &apos;t speak to Mary .
You have to let me help you .
You &apos;ll never forget it , I &apos;m pretty sure .
I hope that you will like it .
Why isn &apos;t it here ?
No one is going to know .
Did you see Tom today ?
We don &apos;t study French .
It &apos;s great to see you &apos;re having so much fun .
I don &apos;t want to do it like that .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
I had fun here .
Tom was home alone at the time .
We &apos;re not leaving until we see Tom .
I fell into the water .
Have you heard this story already ?
You don &apos;t have to do it .
Tom came home by bus .
Tom saw Mary waiting .
Tom asked Mary why she &apos;d done that .
I can &apos;t believe I listened to you .
Maybe Tom was right .
Maybe Tom knows something .
Her son has her eyes .
I don &apos;t want to go with Tom .
He gave up .
Tom is far from happy .
Tom isn &apos;t looking at Mary .
Tom had only three dollars on him .
I only told you what Tom told me .
I need some help with my work .
He tried it over and over again .
You know enough .
Tom is better at this than I am .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
Tom arrived just as I was going home .
This one &apos;s no good .
They enjoy one another &apos;s company .
Tom has to come to Boston .
I don &apos;t know if he knows it .
I &apos;ll take it to Tom .
I don &apos;t know what you want .
My father is busy now .
You may go at once .
Did you see it ?
Tom is back in Boston .
It &apos;s too late now .
I want to know what you &apos;ll do .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even speak to me .
Tom made Mary wait for a long time .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that kind of thing anymore .
Tom spent the night at a friend &apos;s house .
I saw that one .
You need to help me .
I have to go back to work now .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been there .
Nobody had an answer .
You have to speak only English .
I have written a letter .
What you do is up to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy , does he ?
Tom is living in Boston .
Tom knows he can always count on Mary .
He asked me what I needed .
I think about that from time to time .
I find this difficult to believe .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
Let &apos;s see what happens .
Can you believe that ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
I &apos;m sure that Tom will be here soon .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us the truth .
Is it there ?
Tom has a thing for Mary .
He doesn &apos;t have a family .
I love you .
I have to have it .
It &apos;s my book .
Why are we doing this again ?
She looks very happy .
Well , I have to go now .
I don &apos;t want a boyfriend .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
He will be back soon .
I think Tom is sick .
He tried to speak French to us .
I saw that coming .
What is it you want to know ?
Don &apos;t give Tom what he wants .
I don &apos;t like my school .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t study .
How did you get into my house ?
Tom didn &apos;t see anything .
I found these .
Are you sure this is what Tom wanted us to buy ?
Tom was born there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing .
We &apos;re going to see Tom .
Tom kept me waiting for more than three hours .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
What will they do ?
Tom saw you do that .
When I got back , I found my car missing .
I have been busy .
He is still alive .
I came here to give you something .
What &apos;s Tom want ?
Tom is with me .
Whoever wants the book may have it .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
I &apos;m only thinking of you .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know .
I don &apos;t want it .
Why are we here again ?
You &apos;re better off without me .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
Tom was already doing that when I got here .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
Why do you think ?
This is Japan .
She had nothing to do yesterday .
I will give you anything you want .
What about your wife ?
That wasn &apos;t a mistake .
This is her house .
He &apos;s not one of us .
I &apos;m still in love with you .
He said nothing .
They &apos;re late , as usual .
This one is ours .
My father is here .
I &apos;m done with you .
I know that you know .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Mary ?
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
What &apos;s Tom eating ?
I love my parents .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I don &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
Why are you at home ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for her help .
We want to see it .
We &apos;ve forgotten something .
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
Tom is all by himself .
I don &apos;t know which is which .
How about you ?
What don &apos;t we know ?
You never seem to get sick .
Tom and Mary are together .
Tom does want to do that .
I haven &apos;t seen him for a long time .
What do you want me to see ?
That is no business of yours .
He looks like a good boy .
Can you help us ?
It &apos;s up to you .
What &apos;s that your wearing ?
People don &apos;t want to hear that .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy .
I said I &apos;d get it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I know .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
I thought I could do it .
Can you do it ?
You need me more than I need you .
I &apos;m going to take Tom home .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
Are there kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t watching .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
I don &apos;t know how to help Tom .
Tom thought about it .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
I made that for you .
Do you want to come over to my house ?
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Maybe they know something .
Who &apos;s having a problem here , you or Tom ?
I consider Tom handsome .
You don &apos;t want to talk about it at all , do you ?
Can you please say that again ?
She won &apos;t like this .
Tom , I need to tell you something .
That &apos;s not an option .
Tom seems afraid .
I hope you know that .
How do you plan to help ?
I bought the book .
The house is pretty .
Are you sure about this ?
I think it would be fun .
The police never showed up .
I begged Tom not to go .
I know what it takes .
I &apos;ve never done this in my life .
Here &apos;s Tom .
I used to do that as a kid .
I don &apos;t know how I did that .
I thought Tom was in Australia .
I know them .
The book is here .
You &apos;re big .
Tom and I are scared .
Tom asked Mary why she was so late .
Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
No one was alive .
I didn &apos;t know Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
We &apos;ll discuss this problem later .
I &apos;ll go ask Tom .
Tom has a lot of work to do .
Tom had a little money .
Can I help you with that ?
We make a great team .
Tom might be able to do that .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
Tom isn &apos;t good-looking .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
I &apos;ll wait here until she comes .
He doesn &apos;t look happy .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see that .
I hope you know that .
No one knows that I like you .
Can you find her ?
I don &apos;t know how other people do it .
We &apos;ll have a great time .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom abandoned them .
Is that all you have to say to me ?
Tom is talking to himself .
He doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
I heard you .
I told you I didn &apos;t want any coffee .
What happened to you yesterday ?
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom wrote to Mary this week .
We have to leave now .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
We still need your help .
I don &apos;t remember what I wanted .
I would like to see your mother .
How do you think we can help Tom ?
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
What are these people doing ?
You &apos;re very good .
We want what we want .
Can &apos;t you help me just a little bit ?
I think you can help us .
I &apos;m coming home , Tom .
Tom knows better .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
No one has ever said such things to me .
No one saw us .
How long have you been a doctor here ?
He should have worked harder .
It has nothing to do with you .
My French isn &apos;t that good .
When did I give you that ?
I know what we can do .
Tom makes Mary very happy .
Why don &apos;t we take a look ?
If you ever need a job , come see me .
I lost .
I know that much myself .
Are you here ?
You can &apos;t eat here .
Mother always gets up early in the morning .
Are you sure , Tom ?
I know what you &apos;re going to say .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom that myself .
Tom is from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
Here are their books .
You lost .
Which of you did it ?
I only want to help you .
I think Tom will listen to me .
I &apos;m already busy .
There &apos;s no one in the house .
Did Tom tell you ?
I need some coffee .
Tom is still outside .
Tom couldn &apos;t see anything .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
You can wait here .
I will never forget this .
You don &apos;t look all that happy .
Tom won &apos;t know .
They know everything .
There was hardly anyone in the room .
I can &apos;t find a thing .
I saw her last week .
Tom made some coffee .
Did Tom tell you who his wife is ?
Tom was happy .
What have you eaten ?
We &apos;re not doing that .
They &apos;ll need help .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a lot to give .
Tom left me for another woman .
I met a friend .
I have one of those , too .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
Did Tom see anything ?
I &apos;ll be present .
It &apos;s not that simple .
You &apos;ve found something .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m too tired to help him .
There is no answer to your question .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom &apos;s around at the moment .
I think you know why I &apos;m here .
I can &apos;t just not do anything . I have to do something .
Tom is in Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
It &apos;s for my family .
I haven &apos;t seen you in a long time .
This isn &apos;t about you .
Is that for me ?
She wanted to be alone .
Is there anything you want to tell us ?
I don &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Nothing ever happens here .
Tom may be there .
Tom bought a car last week .
We &apos;re a little early .
How &apos;re we doing ?
Tom and Mary have been here for three hours .
Tom asked something .
All of my children want to go to Australia .
Tom isn &apos;t a good boy .
I don &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t need to do that .
Where is Tom working now ?
You &apos;ll be with me .
How many people know about this ?
I won &apos;t talk to you .
I want you to leave now .
Have you seen it ?
We all make mistakes .
There &apos;s enough food for all of you .
I &apos;ve often heard Tom say that .
We &apos;re not stopping .
Does Tom have a girlfriend ?
We lost a lot of time .
I &apos;ll give it to Tom .
I want Tom to come with us .
You have only to give him a little help .
It &apos;s great to meet you .
Tom is so happy .
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
Tom can &apos;t read yet .
I must find Tom .
Tom said something in French that I couldn &apos;t understand .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
This is me .
You did what had to be done .
I asked Tom where he had gone to school .
He can &apos;t buy himself a car .
When and where shall we meet ?
I have nothing to say .
She should not have done such a thing .
I &apos;m as old as you .
I didn &apos;t see it .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
We need a car big enough for the whole family .
Tom came to help .
Tom says he &apos;s happy .
Who gave you this ?
He &apos;s the man that was here last week .
He says that he enjoyed it very much .
I fear nothing .
Give me those .
Tom asked Mary where the dog was .
She came to see me .
I thought about my family .
How long can you stay ?
I &apos;ll know what to do .
She let him drive on his own .
Have you eaten supper yet ?
I never heard you play it better .
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
I &apos;m not sorry that I did this .
What &apos;s up with you and Tom ?
Are you free tomorrow ?
Tom has been avoiding Mary all week .
You seem to know a great deal about Tom .
You shouldn &apos;t go to work .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
Tom had some questions .
We &apos;d better go home now .
What &apos;ll Tom say ?
I wanted to buy the book .
I did everything for you .
May I come , too ?
Here &apos;s what I think .
Mary told me that she didn &apos;t love her husband anymore .
Tom can &apos;t swim and Mary can &apos;t either .
I &apos;ll go swimming tomorrow .
I &apos;d like to stay a little longer .
Tom didn &apos;t think so at all .
Is it five already ?
I believe it to be true .
I &apos;m in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
That &apos;s my answer .
He &apos;s your father .
Tom knows something I don &apos;t .
Did Tom give it to you ?
You may take my word for it .
I &apos;m busy right now .
We &apos;re giving up .
Hand it to him .
I should &apos;ve known better .
Her dog isn &apos;t very fast .
I plan to stay in the city .
My watch is ten minutes fast .
It &apos;s night .
Where does Tom want to do that ?
I gave Tom that .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
My mother doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
Tom is my boy .
You &apos;ll like this .
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening .
She made him happy .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
He did what he had been told .
Let Tom do it .
I think about Tom every day .
Who found them ?
They have what they want .
Did you hear what I said ?
Tom had no money left .
I &apos;m very sorry I came home so late .
It sickens me .
Why don &apos;t you want this ?
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
They don &apos;t listen to me .
Who &apos;s at the door ?
I want to know about you .
I saw them yesterday .
I don &apos;t believe a word Tom says .
I want to see Tom .
I &apos;m not sure I want Tom working for us .
He still lives with his parents .
Tom wants more coffee .
I am sorry that my friend is not here .
Why are you out here ?
We &apos;re here for Tom .
This book isn &apos;t as heavy as that one .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
Tom can &apos;t speak French well .
Aren &apos;t you going to finish your dinner ?
I already did that .
Tom wasn &apos;t tired .
Tom went swimming with us yesterday .
How long have you had this problem ?
Tom knows why Mary did that .
May I do that with Tom ?
I said I &apos;d be there .
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
I don &apos;t know anything about her family .
Are you still up ?
Tom came .
I don &apos;t have any children .
She is said to have been beautiful .
I &apos;ll live .
Can I ask why not ?
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t from Boston ?
Tom told Mary .
I have to be here all night .
I was not a bit tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
He found my bike .
Tom may not come .
What do you want to do with that ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom does .
Tom isn &apos;t going to understand .
Tom still speaks French every day .
He came home at ten .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
Tom is going to do fine .
I &apos;m not done with you .
That book is old .
Is Tom with Mary ?
You can &apos;t stay for long .
I let Tom in the house .
There was more than enough food .
Tom likes being at home .
Do you want to go with Tom ?
Tom has everything he needs .
I &apos;m too busy to help you right now .
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
I can &apos;t go , nor do I want to .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
I think he is a doctor .
What time , exactly , did Tom leave ?
It &apos;s time to leave .
You &apos;re always busy .
I was busy the whole day .
No one wanted to talk about it .
Tom needs it .
What &apos;ll it be like ?
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I &apos;m finished with you .
What time can you come ?
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t really know what to do .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary just said that .
Have you found something ?
He hasn &apos;t done anything .
I think it &apos;s time you and Tom went home .
I pretended not to understand what he was saying .
I would do anything for you .
I don &apos;t ever go there anymore .
I &apos;d like that .
Here she is !
I could see Tom was still alive .
Tom knows what &apos;s going on .
We are working for you .
Can you do this ?
I want to take Tom with me .
I have work to do .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s condition ?
What do we have ?
You had better go at once .
Do you have any questions ?
Do you know why I &apos;m here ?
I know a man who speaks French .
Tom will drive you home .
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
You &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom and I are going to be there .
I don &apos;t care what Tom does .
That &apos;s what I wanted to ask .
Is it time ?
It &apos;s mine , not his .
I go to work every day .
You don &apos;t have to go .
I should &apos;ve listened to what my mother said .
He will be a good teacher .
I &apos;ve met you before .
We &apos;re not leaving you here .
I have to go talk to Tom .
It wasn &apos;t enough .
That &apos;s enough .
I came here to see you .
Tom knows something we don &apos;t .
The bus hasn &apos;t come yet .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston ?
Perhaps I can help you .
We can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom we saw .
Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
I &apos;m right , aren &apos;t I ?
I think Tom is doing that , too .
Tom and Mary were busy .
I want to know why .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been sick .
I want Tom &apos;s money .
What wasn &apos;t easy ?
You must go to bed now .
Tom had nothing to read .
Tom wasn &apos;t too tired to study .
There is a letter for you .
I &apos;m going to my sister &apos;s .
I &apos;d like a book .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to believe .
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
I can &apos;t go alone .
What &apos;re you going to do ?
Tom asked me for something I couldn &apos;t give him .
They believe you .
She did not say anything .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a brother .
I &apos;m coming to you .
Don &apos;t you know how ?
I &apos;ll do that .
Have you told Tom &apos;s mother ?
He gave me back the money .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
We know you have it .
No one knows where Tom is .
I can &apos;t leave work until five .
Tom knows what happened .
Tom knows hardly anything about it .
Tom &apos;s making his bed .
Where &apos;s the doctor ?
I would like to speak with Tom .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
Tom wondered what Mary was going to do .
There &apos;s no one here .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
I don &apos;t have that much time left .
How did you find us ?
He can &apos;t handle it .
Can I speak to Tom ?
I know how many of them there are .
Tom wants to see me .
They &apos;ve still got Tom .
Are you my doctor ?
Who will come with me ?
Did you get their letter ?
How many friends do you have ?
Tom is happy to be home .
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We have everything we need now .
I went there to see her .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I forgot that Tom didn &apos;t speak French .
That &apos;ll help .
This is not good .
When do we want it ?
I like it , too .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
Tom &apos;s not home .
I don &apos;t like what Tom is doing .
Thank you for doing that .
I don &apos;t know what they are doing .
Is Tom happy ?
I wish I could write as well as Tom .
My sister has been sick .
That can &apos;t be Tom .
Take your time with it .
How is your mother ?
It wasn &apos;t ours .
When is Tom going to do that ?
Do you have much money with you ?
Aren &apos;t you Tom ?
She goes to school .
They were afraid .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I can tell you where to find Tom .
She seems to have been happy .
We &apos;re going to have a baby .
Tom is good to me .
Did Tom do that ?
I thought you said Tom was in Boston .
If you don &apos;t believe me , go and see for yourself .
They may not know anything about this .
I love this school .
Tom gets up early .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well yet .
Here are our books .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
Tom isn &apos;t that type of guy .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
Did your mother make those ?
I gave Mary a book .
I &apos;m not like you .
Aren &apos;t you late ?
I want the money .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she had to get back to work .
Tom likes you .
I want to know why I &apos;m here .
It has never been done before .
You should probably go .
You &apos;re not listening .
It doesn &apos;t need to be white , but I &apos;d prefer white .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about this .
Tom and Mary have an understanding .
Tom and I see each other every day .
It &apos;s a very good question .
I need this money .
You can count on me .
We are at home today .
My work is almost finished .
I think Tom is fine .
It &apos;s hard to believe that Tom really did that .
I will give you this book .
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
The story appears to be true .
Why do you want to know ?
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
I &apos;m thinking of you .
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t here .
You &apos;ve really done a fine job .
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle .
He doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
What &apos;re you guys doing here ?
Tom said Mary is a good mom .
Tom likes playing with my dog .
I don &apos;t want Tom to come .
Tom told me what you did .
Tom has a lot of friends here .
We can do a lot better .
Have you ever seen anything like this before ?
Tom saw him .
Are you out there ?
Why did you do what you did ?
He said good night to his parents .
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
There &apos;s no one there .
That is a table .
This is not for you .
Tom wanted to wait for the next bus .
I spent the whole day thinking about Tom .
Tom is really late .
I think I know what this is .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I didn &apos;t go .
Let &apos;s forget about this .
Tom has started studying French again .
I can understand what she is saying .
I just need a little time .
I wish I had more money .
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
They left without me .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Can I have something to eat ?
Tom made a mistake .
Where do you want this ?
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
I want you to come with me .
Give me that money .
He took his time .
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
What would you like to eat ?
I &apos;m going to take this home .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
Tom said that he really liked me .
I was hardly able to see it .
I can &apos;t let you do that .
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
You can stay with us .
We &apos;re friends now .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy .
They can &apos;t do this .
Did you hear about Tom ?
I want to believe you .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
Tom made himself something to eat .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that the way he should be .
Tom can &apos;t see Mary from where he is .
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
This is how I met your mother .
Tom asked Mary for money .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
Please help Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me Tom was here ?
There are people here who need your help .
Tom seems to like Boston .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
There are still people who don &apos;t know how to read .
Tom has to leave in a few minutes .
He couldn &apos;t do such a thing .
I &apos;ve got a lot of friends .
Don &apos;t talk !
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
Tom and I want to go home .
I think that would be good .
She could not believe what she saw .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in the city .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go .
I am tired .
Thank you for coming .
Tom gave Mary a piece of his mind .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
They can &apos;t see you .
How old are your kids ?
Tom and Mary have the same opinion .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
Your French is getting much better .
What do Tom and Mary look like ?
They &apos;re waiting for you .
Have you heard from him ?
Tom said he &apos;s very happy .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
Have you told him yet ?
My family is in Boston .
He asked my mother .
You know that I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t helpful .
He doesn &apos;t know much about Japan .
I don &apos;t know what to do and neither does anyone else .
Tom is working on it now .
This is none of your business .
Tom is home alone with his dog .
I &apos;ll be back in just a few minutes .
Tom gets along well with Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy .
We go to school because we want to learn .
I guess I &apos;d better get back to work .
That &apos;s what we do here .
We can do it right now .
What did you buy for your boyfriend ?
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re worried .
What can you give me ?
These are my books .
Tom tried to leave , but Mary wouldn &apos;t let him .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
Can I get a little help , please ?
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
May I say something ?
Tom barely said a word .
I did that a lot .
I think I found a problem .
I don &apos;t want to say that to Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
Tom can speak French , too .
When was the last time you saw her ?
It doesn &apos;t have a name .
Tom knows what he wants to see .
Tom saw Mary .
Tom went to bed .
They say Tom can do that .
I answered the door .
I haven &apos;t seen her in years .
I don &apos;t want to do this .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
What do you like to eat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents .
Everyone &apos;s talking about what Tom did .
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
He will come soon .
Is Tom your brother ?
Tom isn &apos;t like people say he is .
Tom wants to come home .
I &apos;m getting better .
I can name names .
I &apos;m not afraid any more .
You &apos;re working hard .
Tom had a problem with Mary .
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
We &apos;re not going to do that .
I think it won &apos;t be a problem .
I hope you like what I &apos;ve just given you .
What &apos;re we doing here , Tom ?
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
Tom wasn &apos;t always this way .
I think I &apos;ll be fine .
The car is not available today .
I think that it &apos;s too big .
Tom isn &apos;t alive .
You simply don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
Tom has plenty of time .
I go home early every day .
May I ask how old you are ?
How big is your house ?
Tom is as tall as you .
She opened the door .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
You cannot do this .
There &apos;s still a fair bit of work to be done .
Tom doesn &apos;t often do that .
When are you busy ?
Tom can understand Mary &apos;s French .
It never happened .
Maybe they &apos;re busy .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
I can &apos;t find my watch .
From this point , we &apos;ll go on by car .
He speaks English and French .
Do you have children already ?
He is no longer a boy .
You &apos;ll get your money .
You can &apos;t swim here .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
Tom has enough money to do whatever he wants to do .
Tom can &apos;t find a job .
What is going on here ?
What can you give me ?
Tom just watches .
That &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
How &apos;re you doing ?
Tom can help .
What is the matter with you ?
She did it for her children .
Is that what you want to do ?
I &apos;ll do what needs to be done .
I have to go to sleep .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thought .
I believe I was wrong .
That doesn &apos;t concern you .
Tom hung out with Mary all day .
Tom didn &apos;t go to work all last week .
I wish I could do more .
What are you doing here so early ?
I want to wait for Tom .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
Tom never said that .
Tom likes that one .
You need to learn French .
Tom has to do that .
I have a table .
Did they ever find Tom ?
Can I leave now ?
Do you have any water ?
What &apos;s that have to do with me ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been back here for years .
I &apos;ll tell Tom .
I &apos;m very , very happy for Tom .
You can &apos;t scare me .
They want to know what &apos;s going on .
Here &apos;s your dog .
You didn &apos;t tell me everything .
I need to read a lot .
Tom and his friends are outside .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say to Tom .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in over a week .
Tom and Mary both want to study French .
What &apos;s Tom going to say ?
I &apos;m very happy .
Tom was unafraid .
Nobody was home .
If you speak French , I won &apos;t understand .
I don &apos;t have a car , but my sister does .
You ought to do it at once .
I really wish to see you today .
Tom will spend tomorrow here .
I just have one question for you .
Why don &apos;t you help us ?
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
Tom might be right .
Tom is very good at French .
I saw Tom doing that yesterday .
I forgot it .
Tom told me that he needed some money .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
Tom was very helpful yesterday .
Is Tom one of your friends ?
No one &apos;s watching .
There is no clock in my room .
I want to have nothing to do with you .
There is a man at the door .
She gets tired quickly .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself .
I can &apos;t believe anything Tom says anymore .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
He has come !
That &apos;s not up to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what Mary has done .
I will speak with you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
I know you can do it .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Did you hear about what happened last night ?
Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
Tom is doing quite well in school .
I don &apos;t want to come to Boston .
Why weren &apos;t we told the truth ?
It &apos;s time to go back home .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
We know who they are .
It was white .
Tom is a good friend of yours , isn &apos;t he ?
It could be Tom .
My father is still ill in bed .
She looked as if she had been sick for a long time .
This would be a mistake .
He left early in order not to be late .
Tom was in the house .
He and I are teachers .
Tom ate it .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
I know what happened .
Tom has been gone for a long time .
When do you plan to go ?
You &apos;ve already forgotten .
He came just as I was leaving .
Let &apos;s have dinner .
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
I wasn &apos;t even there .
Tom would have eaten more if he hadn &apos;t been sick .
I need the money .
Tom is not happy .
I know where he lives .
We &apos;ll be happy .
Tom can write well .
Tom appeared busy .
Can you come back later ?
I think that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;d do .
I must know the truth .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Is anybody home ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
She is very busy .
I don &apos;t know either .
See you tonight .
I &apos;m not sure of anything .
Leave us alone .
I think that he is right .
Tom needs you here .
They know that .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
You aren &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;ve already had my supper .
We can speak French .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
This book is not as easy as that one .
This used to be my room .
Tom has a car .
We should visit Boston again .
I think this is the way to do it .
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
I haven &apos;t forgotten .
We &apos;ve found something .
I just did that this morning .
I want to know what &apos;s out there .
Tom can &apos;t get enough of it .
Tom is better than me .
He bought a book and gave it to his father .
You &apos;ll understand it later on .
You should do that soon .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I want Tom to be safe .
I know that Tom was at your house today .
It is time you went to school .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
He can swim .
Tom has already eaten dinner .
I &apos;m going to read some other books .
She seems to be happy .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
I bought the book yesterday .
You should eat something .
How good are you ?
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
It looks like Tom got what he wanted .
I want you to come to Boston .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
You are what you eat .
I &apos;ve got to get back to Boston .
Everybody wants to be here .
Tom doesn &apos;t want our help .
I think you should do it .
Here you are , Tom .
I said I saw Tom .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really here .
I will never have a son .
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .
Tom was there yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do that .
I know what you &apos;re going to ask .
I think we &apos;re fine .
Tom is going to do that again .
I like your car .
They saw you .
Nobody wants you to do this .
What do they do ?
This car is good .
I &apos;m certain .
You &apos;re too good for Tom .
That &apos;s too good a story to be true .
Where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
I said I didn &apos;t know Tom .
Tom wants to take it .
You should &apos;ve told me the truth .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
I don &apos;t know a thing about her .
We don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom is eating something .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
Only Tom knows .
Nobody had an answer .
Why do you want that ?
What do they want us to do ?
I know her well .
I &apos;m here with my family .
Did Tom like Boston ?
What do you want me to do about it ?
I saw them .
Tom left five minutes early .
I know almost nothing about you .
I can &apos;t help you with that .
They don &apos;t make you happy .
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
I saw her a week ago .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about this .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
What do you want Tom to do ?
Do you want this ?
You &apos;re good , aren &apos;t you ?
What do you have for me ?
Give me back my book . I need it again .
The story was true .
This money is mine .
You alone can help me .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
Who gave this to you ?
Tom wanted to know if Mary had a boyfriend .
There &apos;s a problem I have to talk to you about .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
You aren &apos;t yourself today .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
She gave him the car .
I like their house .
I &apos;m always busy .
We both want to go to Boston .
I need to do something .
Are you good at French ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to be gone long .
What &apos;ll happen ?
Thank you for giving this to me .
Tom , I need your help .
Tom wants to learn .
I am busy now and can &apos;t play with you .
It looks like Tom is done .
You &apos;re not me .
I &apos;m coming home .
I &apos;m not going home .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
I haven &apos;t got all day .
We &apos;re doing what we love to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is .
My brother is very tall .
Why didn &apos;t you say it like that ?
He left the room .
I &apos;ve been here for hours .
Tell me what happened .
Tom was very happy .
Tom didn &apos;t answer the phone .
I used to do that every day .
He wants to talk to you .
Tom is good-looking , isn &apos;t he ?
How did it happen ?
Tom is doing well now .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
Is that a question ?
I believe that everything will be okay .
Tom asked Mary why she was late .
We know what happened to Tom &apos;s car .
Tom doesn &apos;t look good .
Does Tom have a car ?
Tom should &apos;ve studied harder .
We &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
Why are you home ?
What just happened here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this for me .
It &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
I can &apos;t tell you the answer to that yet .
Mary was beautiful .
There &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
We &apos;re leaving tonight .
I &apos;m going to need help .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak much French .
I can &apos;t do this .
Did Tom see this ?
You should probably tell Tom what to do .
Tom is his usual self today .
I need to know where you are .
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
When did they leave ?
He asked the man to help him .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
I know Tom does that every morning .
I need some help with my work .
Do you know if Tom can speak French ?
We want to talk .
It &apos;s one of mine .
What are you going to say ?
He bought himself a dog .
How is Tom today ?
I think I know what &apos;s happening now .
What do you have on for tomorrow night ?
Do you know why Tom came here today ?
What did you do with Tom ?
I walked alone .
We can &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m feeling much better now .
You are as tall as my sister .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I love my mother very much .
It appears to me that you are right .
Do you want to hear it ?
She didn &apos;t give me my money back .
Here we are .
What did you just say ?
Tom and I were very busy last week .
Tom looks like his brother .
This book belongs to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to go .
Do you want to go again ?
Tom and I &apos;ve gotten back together .
They &apos;re leaving us .
I had help .
They &apos;ll know what to do .
We have a lot to do .
I &apos;ve finished writing the letter .
I think you &apos;ll want this .
We don &apos;t have that long .
Tom is the one we want .
Tom is heavy .
You don &apos;t even know his name , do you ?
I want to speak in French .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
Tom is not able to swim .
Where was he going ?
How long will we have ?
I have everything I wanted .
Is this Tom &apos;s book ?
Is there anything that I can do for you ?
Why is he doing this ?
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t talk with you .
You &apos;re a problem .
I should &apos;ve studied more .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
I &apos;ll be back .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where .
I like to make people happy .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
That is not true .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
It belongs to Tom .
Are these ours ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Why &apos;s Tom looking at me ?
I didn &apos;t think it mattered .
Why shouldn &apos;t Tom leave ?
I know what I like .
I really hope so .
Have you seen this ?
This bicycle is Tom &apos;s .
Both of my parents can speak French .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
I love you just as you are .
We &apos;ve been here before .
Tom and Mary are with John .
What did you do exactly ?
I told Mary that I loved her .
Is that your car ?
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up .
What would Tom say if he were here ?
Can he have said such a thing ?
It happened .
Are we good to go ?
When will we arrive ?
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
Let &apos;s just have some fun .
I wish Tom were here now .
You could &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
Do you want me to come ?
Tom has come .
I think they saw us .
I know exactly what needs to be done .
I &apos;d rather not discuss it right now .
It &apos;s time for us to go .
You &apos;re the one I love .
Are you saying you don &apos;t know ?
I &apos;m not a child .
I &apos;m not busy now .
Tom is gravely ill .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Can you believe what he said ?
I asked Tom to help .
Tom wondered where Mary went to school .
Tom is going to do that for me .
I thought I could help Tom , but I couldn &apos;t .
Tom knows what to do , doesn &apos;t he ?
It is on me .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
I &apos;m not sure why .
How do you live like this ?
He could do it .
I &apos;ve all but finished doing that .
I &apos;d like to take this with me .
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
I love the people here .
What about us ?
Stop doing that .
He did it for fun .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a boyfriend .
I asked where he had been .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
Maybe I should study French .
Tom didn &apos;t say why he was avoiding Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston yet .
She watched the children going back to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom really should go to Boston .
They &apos;ll understand .
I don &apos;t know how many years I have left .
You &apos;d better not do it .
I have to give this book to Tom .
I did what you told me to do .
Tom had work to do .
Tom can do what he likes .
All I think about is you .
Tom wants to know what &apos;s going on .
Tom isn &apos;t happy .
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
I always have time for you .
Why aren &apos;t they worried ?
I don &apos;t have time right now .
Did you do this on your own ?
You &apos;re not supposed to do that , you know .
I was there .
I did want that to happen .
Please don &apos;t ask .
I got a lot to say .
I don &apos;t want to have children .
We &apos;ll watch you .
What do you want with Tom ?
I saw Tom coming .
They don &apos;t talk to us anymore .
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
You don &apos;t even know how .
Give me just a little .
Don &apos;t show off .
Tom has been here for years .
Do you want to go with Tom ?
French is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
Tom could do this .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
Tom can &apos;t swim very well .
Tom and Mary are still working .
I got it for next to nothing .
Do you want to tell me what this is ?
We &apos;ll go together .
Aren &apos;t those your parents ?
Tom looks a bit tired .
What is Tom to you ?
I really don &apos;t know him .
Tom likes it in Boston .
Tom &apos;s not coming , because I don &apos;t want him to .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
Maybe I don &apos;t want to know .
They &apos;re going to do it for us .
Give us three minutes .
What do you need ?
Did you go directly to your room ?
Tom isn &apos;t sure .
Tom made a mistake .
Did you do this on your own ?
I haven &apos;t been in Australia very long .
Tom always looked busy .
Tom has been here for quite a long time .
This is hers .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about Mary .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend and Tom doesn &apos;t either .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I came as fast as I could .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
The door won &apos;t open .
Tom is as old as my father .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it .
That won &apos;t work !
This isn &apos;t about me .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
I &apos;ll come .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
I would like to be alone .
I &apos;d like to go with you , but I &apos;m broke .
Is that all you want to know ?
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
He &apos;s like a brother to me .
Tom was a schoolteacher .
Let it go , Tom .
I don &apos;t like you .
Do you want this or not ?
It doesn &apos;t matter so much .
I don &apos;t have Tom &apos;s money .
I know Tom had nothing to do with that .
I have a lot to do .
How long was Tom there ?
Are they alive ?
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary .
Why did you do that ?
You have a son named Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I just want to help .
Tom is very good to Mary .
I like being alone .
Tom heard that .
I thought I saw something .
Tom is sorry .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you and Tom .
Tom wants to go to Boston .
It is a great pleasure being with you .
How old is your sister ?
This is not my problem .
What do you want to do with it ?
We need you .
Tom never saw Mary again .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand what we meant .
I know the man you came with .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother .
Tom has poor eyesight .
Tom ditched me .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
You can &apos;t have this .
He has another son .
Tom can &apos;t speak much French .
Tom isn &apos;t here .
People don &apos;t know how to drive around here .
I don &apos;t know what to say about that .
Where will we eat ?
He came by bus .
I found it .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
Thank you for giving me this .
What &apos;ve you got ?
You didn &apos;t need to do that .
I know that he knows .
Did Tom actually say that ?
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
Are you planning on buying a car ?
We don &apos;t want that anymore .
She asked me how old I was .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
I &apos;m not leaving here .
Are you Tom &apos;s brother ?
We are at school together .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
Do you have enough time to do that ?
That &apos;s quite a long time .
Have you seen my wife ?
What do you want me to do with these ?
It isn &apos;t like that .
Tom might talk .
Is it money you want ?
Finding work wasn &apos;t easy .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
Do you have any more of these ?
I want to learn French .
Tom knows how to make Mary happy .
When do you return home ?
When are you coming back home ?
Nobody could believe it .
How old do you think Tom is ?
You still have a lot to learn .
What do you think I should &apos;ve said ?
You &apos;re better than Tom .
How are we going to help Tom ?
Do you have any food ?
I love doing this .
Tom came to live here .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to work .
It is a long story .
Do you know why I gave it to you ?
What don &apos;t you have ?
I never got an answer from Tom .
It would &apos;ve been so easy .
Tom saw Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything to her .
Do you have a book ?
Tom knows I know .
I want to know what you know .
He has money .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that earlier ?
I want one , too .
Are you sure about that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that , does he ?
Tom is all right .
My son came to my room .
What do we know ?
I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;ll help .
Tom is exactly like his father .
This one belongs to Tom .
I &apos;ll do it with you .
Is Tom Mary &apos;s son ?
Tom often doesn &apos;t come to school .
This house is very good .
My father bought me the book .
Tom never should &apos;ve let Mary out of his sight .
You can &apos;t even help yourself .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
The coffee &apos;s ready .
He has no girlfriend .
Thanks for this .
Isn &apos;t Tom your brother ?
I have to work tomorrow .
Tom is coming to Boston .
It &apos;s up to you , Tom .
I &apos;m here to help .
Have we met before ?
We have to do it .
I like you , too .
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
I &apos;m OK .
This is too good to be true .
Do you know where my watch is ?
Why won &apos;t Tom leave ?
You &apos;re welcome to wait .
Why are they doing this to me ?
What do you want from Tom ?
I heard that Tom did that .
Please go to school .
My father became old .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you want .
We can &apos;t find Tom .
I was very scared .
Let Tom stay .
I &apos;ve forgotten the name of Tom &apos;s wife .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t go either .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything to me about that .
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
She has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom wanted to study with Mary .
Tom and I did that .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what to do .
It takes time .
My mother can &apos;t attend .
You can do it .
He can &apos;t do it .
Tom wants to learn French .
You have to come .
I want to see your house .
My father is always busy .
I don &apos;t know why he said that to me .
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything about himself .
What &apos;s the matter ?
I was afraid of my father .
Tom was really good .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Tom really likes Mary .
Tell me it isn &apos;t true .
I &apos;ll tell you when I get back .
It was still there .
I don &apos;t like those people .
You don &apos;t seem to be very happy .
I think Tom will like that .
You &apos;ll have to ask someone else .
I &apos;m not at all scared .
He is as healthy as ever .
What &apos;s the time ?
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
You &apos;ll feel better tomorrow , I promise .
She thought for a few minutes .
Is this the one you saw ?
This isn &apos;t going to be good .
I know why that is .
He thought that I was very tired .
I was planning on telling you .
I hope you feel better tomorrow .
Tom has been good to me .
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this .
He is playing outdoors .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand .
I &apos;ve got to go back to Boston tomorrow .
This is what you have to do .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have nothing to do now .
I &apos;m not worried about it .
I thought that he was a doctor .
Who can that be ?
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
Not all of us have eaten yet .
Tom wanted to have dinner in bed .
I &apos;d like to have an answer .
Who says I &apos;m afraid of Tom ?
I can &apos;t wait that long .
Did you tell Tom that ?
What did the doctor tell you ?
Tom asked me if I was happy .
Can it be true ?
Is that all you want ?
Can I help ?
You can &apos;t leave yet , Tom .
Tom is his brother .
Is Tom finished eating ?
That &apos;s for Tom .
I love his son .
We &apos;ll go together .
It &apos;s at home .
I am a boy .
Tom and I both want you to be happy .
I am through with my work .
Tom could help you .
Have you found an answer to this question ?
I heard that you &apos;re not going home either .
Have you received an answer to your letter ?
Tom wants to know why Mary didn &apos;t go to school today .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have enough time .
How long will you be staying with us ?
I would like to help you .
Tom said that Mary was very tired .
I don &apos;t have to go to the doctor any more . I &apos;m feeling much better .
This dog is white .
You should go home . It &apos;s getting late .
You might have to do this all by yourself .
My cat is happy .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
How did Tom find you ?
I can &apos;t talk to Tom about anything .
Is that you , Tom ?
Tom could get sick .
My mother and father aren &apos;t home right now .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I think it &apos;s time for me to say what I really think .
I told Tom to help Mary , but he didn &apos;t .
You should &apos;ve done it yourself .
What did you do last night ?
I want one like that .
Tom didn &apos;t want to help us today .
You may take my word for it .
This has to wait until tomorrow .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
This book is very good .
I don &apos;t know how to swim .
My friends didn &apos;t do that .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
She has a big family .
I want some money .
Tom only saw Mary once .
I think Tom would like that .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
Why is it here ?
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
I love books .
You can &apos;t do that .
Tom knows I &apos;m at home .
I barely made the train .
I don &apos;t need to do that as often as I used to .
What do you want me to do for you ?
She hit me , not him .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
I don &apos;t have much time left .
I can &apos;t live on my own .
They won &apos;t find it .
Tom , this is my brother , John .
Tom needs to be located .
I can &apos;t stand him .
I need to buy one .
Tom isn &apos;t able to drive yet .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom wrote that book .
I can &apos;t believe that .
I think about Tom all the time .
We don &apos;t need them .
It looks like Tom decided to stay .
It belongs to me now .
I think this book is easy .
What &apos;re you after ?
I know what it &apos;s like to be alone .
The new car is hers .
I &apos;ll go and ask Tom .
We &apos;ve wasted enough time .
That &apos;s what I want from you .
None of the other kids want to play with Tom .
What makes you happy , Tom ?
Tom is not my friend anymore .
I thought I &apos;d go with Tom .
What are you doing ?
He knows how to swim .
I am better than you .
Tom came to see me .
Did you receive my letter ?
I &apos;m not sure about that . It depends .
I don &apos;t know yet .
Is that from a book ?
Tom isn &apos;t around .
Tom saw me .
He has a new woman in his life .
It &apos;s what Tom would want .
We &apos;re not from around here .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I heard you talking .
We didn &apos;t find Tom .
How could I help you ?
I thought about my family .
It was three hours ago .
Tom , there &apos;s something you should know about me .
They &apos;re crazy .
You don &apos;t have to help .
I would like to help you .
A few days later , he came .
Here I am .
I &apos;ll be with you right away .
Have you written to Tom ?
She has been busy since yesterday .
We &apos;ve been there before .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
I can &apos;t eat .
Tom wants to learn how to swim .
I &apos;ve never been better .
I &apos;d rather stay here .
Tom made it for me .
He was able to read the book .
What does Tom have ?
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
We don &apos;t know where Tom is .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
You have a brother , don &apos;t you ?
Everybody had a hard time .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see Mary .
I should read the book .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
I &apos;ll be whatever you want me to be .
Why do you want to know that ?
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
Who &apos;s that with Tom ?
Do you need a ride ?
I don &apos;t have to ask anyone .
What are you doing after work ?
He doesn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
Time &apos;s up .
Tom asked us not to come .
How long will you be staying with us ?
Who gave this to you ?
I just want to know what happened .
That &apos;s his .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
She handed him the money .
Tom will drive you home .
I don &apos;t have anything to eat .
I am well .
Tom knows where we live .
I want my life back .
I thought I told you not to come .
I only saw Tom once .
Tom is going to like it here .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
Did Tom find you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
We &apos;re back .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
That &apos;s how I know .
Don &apos;t leave me behind !
Please don &apos;t go away .
We &apos;ll never have to do this again .
Tom eats a lot .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
This book is yours .
Tom is home again .
Do you know how to drive ?
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
There is a cat .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
This doesn &apos;t concern you .
Tom isn &apos;t at home now .
Thanks for coming .
Tom is a very good friend of mine .
Her father is tall .
Do you want to see more ?
I am a good boy .
Here &apos;s what we know .
I want to be happy .
It has to be me .
I think Mary likes me .
I &apos;m real sorry I wasn &apos;t able to help .
I suppose it can &apos;t be helped .
Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
How long was Tom sick ?
I bought the book for myself , not for my wife .
My mother has made me what I am today .
I don &apos;t know .
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him .
I went straight to bed .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
They don &apos;t want you . They want Tom .
I have no money with me .
It would be fun .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d help him .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston as well ?
How old is your dog ?
Do you remember what you were watching ?
We &apos;re still working .
Tom is planning to eat dinner with Mary tonight .
Tom says he &apos;s fine .
Leave it there .
They must be happy .
Tom knows what you did .
Where can I buy it ?
Tom is very busy now .
No one knows what &apos;s going on .
What do you think I should write ?
I still need to talk to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
You should do that soon .
I am truly sorry .
You should know better .
You should read this .
What time are you planning to leave ?
Being tired , she went to bed early .
Tom has a sister .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
I was at Tom &apos;s place yesterday .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
Tom said he never saw Mary .
You &apos;ve come too early .
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
Is Tom out ?
I want to know what &apos;s good .
Did you eat too much ?
Was that all you saw ?
I don &apos;t have anything .
It &apos;s too good to be true .
My watch is five minutes slow .
I just told Tom the truth .
Don &apos;t you want to go , too ?
I know that already .
I &apos;ll come with you .
No one likes me .
Tom wants more .
Tom made Mary one of these , too .
Don &apos;t you want me here ?
Tom is family .
We should get going .
Are you busy now ?
We &apos;ll tell Tom .
Tom and Mary were happy .
Have you met him already ?
That &apos;s how we did it .
I know what you &apos;re after .
They &apos;re good people .
We lost it .
Do you know where Tom &apos;s car is parked ?
Has Tom arrived yet ?
Tom likes French .
I have good eyesight .
I want to become a doctor .
Tom likes to be here .
We should probably ask Tom .
Tom left five minutes ago .
They are busy .
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
I want to go with Tom .
I think this is good for us .
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up .
Everybody wants to be here .
Where did you see Tom ?
Take your time .
There was nothing you could do about that .
Tom said he &apos;d be here .
I don &apos;t want to go to school tomorrow .
I can &apos;t help myself .
You have a problem .
How long have you had this problem ?
Are you there , Tom ?
Tom wants a large family .
Tom isn &apos;t in .
That &apos;s a good school .
You don &apos;t work here .
What will we eat ?
The big question is why .
We &apos;ll come back later .
What happened to Tom ?
There &apos;s nothing to do here .
Tom likes to show off .
That should make you happy .
I &apos;m fine .
What is it now ?
I can hardly understand you .
We &apos;ve got something for you .
We don &apos;t have all the time in the world .
Tom is going to be with you .
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
I have no family .
I have a lot of books .
Please say that once again in French .
Tom made it easy for me .
No one ever asked .
I shook hands with Tom and left .
It is time to go to bed .
I should learn some French .
What &apos;s up with Tom ?
Do you remember what you said to me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Tom won &apos;t eat that .
Tom says that he wants me to go to Boston with Mary .
I &apos;ll assist Tom .
You have made many mistakes .
Don &apos;t you want to help ?
That &apos;s how we do it .
They did it again .
Is your father a doctor ?
Tom should wait .
How can I help you ?
I saw Tom there .
I don &apos;t want to know .
Tom said that he was sleepy .
Tom &apos;s dog is very big .
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
Tom arrived late .
That &apos;s not what he said .
Where &apos;s everybody else ?
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
I would like to go , too .
I wasn &apos;t a bit tired .
Tom is no longer my friend .
Tom knows that Mary can &apos;t speak French .
I know what it is .
We want to talk to you about a problem .
We can &apos;t help you unless you help us .
You &apos;re way too late .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do this .
I don &apos;t think we were seen .
I &apos;ve never had a friend quite like you .
I met your girlfriend .
He &apos;ll be back soon .
We can rely on Tom .
There is no clock in my room .
No one knows what has happened to him .
They &apos;ve got enough to do already .
He gave her a book .
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him .
I &apos;m not thinking about it .
You &apos;ve got to help me .
I could have helped .
He likes me and I like him too .
Is this your car ?
My father bought me the book .
Tom isn &apos;t safe .
When do you have to do that ?
Tom was my teacher .
Those are too big .
I know where Tom works .
Do you want another one of these ?
I &apos;ve got to find it .
Do you have everything ?
Is there something I could get you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t ever speak French anymore .
That would be a mistake .
Tom left Australia three years ago .
I still have a few minutes .
I &apos;ve got a lot to do .
Do you know the reason ?
Tom did well in school .
I don &apos;t really know why .
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
Why are you still here ?
I think that &apos;s Tom .
Tom looked fine .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind helping Mary occasionally .
We &apos;re very sorry .
I couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
Tom relented .
The last train has already gone .
I love life .
Is she your sister ?
What do you know about that ?
I can &apos;t buy a car .
Tom didn &apos;t go home last night .
We &apos;re worried .
I know what Tom knows .
May I help you ?
Tom was out of town last week .
I went to the station .
I can get it from Tom .
You &apos;re stalling .
See you at school .
Tom told Mary that he would do that .
How do you want me to do that ?
I don &apos;t know how they do it .
Tom is a very good friend .
I should probably tell Tom I &apos;m busy .
She almost always arrives late .
Tom has never been to Boston .
This is the house that he lives in .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
Does he have money ?
They &apos;ll know .
Can we come ?
Tom can drive now .
That &apos;s how it was .
That &apos;s all I need .
Tom wouldn &apos;t want that .
I can &apos;t wait for you .
Please tell me the truth .
I &apos;ll go to Boston to be with family .
I want to do it for Tom .
Tom is really handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
That looks like Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to work here anymore .
He wouldn &apos;t believe us .
Tom and I are with Mary .
They say he &apos;s sick .
How much money do you have on you ?
What &apos;s up , Tom ?
She came home very late .
How do I get to the station from here ?
Say what you have to say .
I &apos;ll be back soon .
They look very tired .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go to bed .
Thanks for doing that for Tom .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I think Tom doesn &apos;t really like Mary very much .
There is someone here .
It &apos;s great to be here .
Can you meet him ?
Can &apos;t you speak French ?
We &apos;ll find them .
I don &apos;t like being home alone .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
What do you mean by it ?
Do you know how to drive a car ?
Tom isn &apos;t tired .
Are you able to speak French ?
I had nothing else to say .
What does Tom have on ?
What did Tom give Mary ?
I can speak English .
Tom knows nothing about Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
Tom was very old .
You can go if you want .
My watch is five minutes fast .
There &apos;s been no one here .
Tom isn &apos;t planning to stay .
Are you home , too ?
I don &apos;t quite know yet .
What are you going to do this evening ?
I couldn &apos;t understand a word Tom said .
Tom is a good father .
I think you know that .
You did not come to school yesterday .
Can your mother drive a car ?
There &apos;s something I forgot to tell you .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
I want to know where Tom is .
That boy won &apos;t tell me his name .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been saying all along .
Tom says that he &apos;s just eaten .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
I think she &apos;ll help me .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
Tom likes French and he &apos;s good at it .
What are we going to do with it ?
I &apos;d better go now .
Did you figure it out on your own ?
I won &apos;t tell Tom what he needs to do .
I know why we &apos;re doing this .
I &apos;m going to wait here for Tom .
We &apos;re brother and sister .
Tom doesn &apos;t talk to me about anything anymore .
Maybe I should write Tom a letter .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I must do it now .
I can &apos;t see it .
Tom said he would write to us .
Can Tom ride a bicycle ?
Did that really just happen ?
It was hard to believe .
We &apos;re going home by car .
We are brother and sister .
I need to be sure that you understand this .
I &apos;m extremely sorry .
It &apos;s about time .
Tom wants to speak .
How many more days will it take Tom to finish doing that ?
Tom really pays attention to people .
I &apos;ve been saying that all along .
Everyone is tired .
Tom has to listen to us .
Where have you been all evening ?
I did this for you .
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
What did you say ? I can &apos;t hear you .
That was never an issue .
What did you find ?
You &apos;re a good boy , Tom .
Tom is from Boston .
Perhaps Tom wanted to buy that .
I &apos;m on the way home .
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary .
You aren &apos;t from around here , are you ?
This book belongs to you .
Can &apos;t you swim at all ?
I only have one friend left .
I was too tired to walk any farther .
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom .
He was late for school yesterday .
It &apos;s better than nothing .
We can &apos;t leave yet . We need to wait for Tom .
How long do you need to stay in Boston ?
How do you do that ?
Why aren &apos;t you in Boston ?
I &apos;ll see you when you get here .
I thought that he would come .
I do like you .
I hope Tom comes .
What &apos;s Tom doing out there ?
What do you expect me to do ?
That remains to be seen .
Tom looked toward Mary .
I know where Tom lives .
This is going to be easy .
I guess you heard about Tom .
I want a room for tonight .
What was Tom &apos;s answer ?
Tom tried to talk to us in French .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
Tom did it very well .
I only need two more minutes .
We &apos;ve found it .
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
I &apos;d ask Tom .
Who listened ?
Where did Tom see you ?
He may not be happy .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
The dog looks sick .
I am busy now .
We do what we have to .
Tom knows I &apos;m here .
You seem tired . You should go to bed .
Why did you say such a thing to him ?
They had nothing to eat .
Your French is really quite good .
She gave him the money .
Tom is a personal friend .
Can you give me this one , please ?
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
All you need to do is wait .
She hardly ever works .
You should wait for Tom .
All my friends do it .
Tom dislikes me .
Tom is giving up .
We &apos;re very sorry about that .
Tom has been in Boston for a week now .
I &apos;ve nothing to give .
Why are you doing this to me ?
How many books do you have ?
It seems that something has happened .
I need someone to talk to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is telling the truth or not .
I couldn &apos;t walk .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to say .
When they &apos;re happy , we &apos;re happy .
Tom must not like Mary very much .
You can &apos;t leave now .
She speaks good English .
Tom has left .
There &apos;s nobody in the house . Everybody &apos;s outside .
They won &apos;t tell us anything .
Did you guys see that ?
I can &apos;t wait any more .
Please call me Tom .
Why did you do what you did ?
You &apos;re not going to like it .
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
Tom gave that to me .
That &apos;s my car .
Tom admitted that what Mary said was true .
I want an answer from you ASAP .
It &apos;s not always like that .
I don &apos;t know if she will come .
When did you get home ?
We know about that .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
I &apos;m just trying to help .
Tom knows what he &apos;s going to do .
Tom speaks French fairly well .
He always wants to have the last word .
Why are we going to Australia ?
How am I going to get home ?
I just wanted to see if I could do that .
I think you should swim .
I think Tom is literate .
Tom wanted you to know .
Who &apos;s that boy standing at the door ?
I can &apos;t drive .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
Tom is in there with Mary and John .
Tom wanted to see Mary .
No one was stung .
Thank you for asking me .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
Tom has a different job now .
I still haven &apos;t found work .
Have you finished what you were doing ?
We &apos;ll be living in Boston .
Such a thing has never happened to me .
He said he would come .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
No one will believe us .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
I like what I like .
Let &apos;s talk about it after school .
What does your sister do now ?
I want to eat something that I can only eat here .
He is often late for school .
Is that as fast as you can go ?
Who came ?
This is my question .
You can &apos;t trust what she says .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
I don &apos;t think I want that .
She seems to be sick .
I don &apos;t like anything here .
I hope no one sees us .
I will not help you .
How long has Tom been working here ?
You have him there .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to walk .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
He attempted suicide .
Tom isn &apos;t quite finished yet .
How many hours are left ?
Can you tell me what this is ?
It was white .
I don &apos;t like you either .
There was nobody there .
What does he say ?
I almost feel bad for Tom .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have liked that .
I &apos;m home .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
He &apos;s not supposed to be here .
Who are these people ?
I thought Tom was going to do that .
Tom never told me where he lived .
Tom has already eaten .
Tom would like to see you .
Tom bought a car .
You know what Tom said about Mary , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
That &apos;s all I know .
That &apos;s not my car .
How old were you then ?
I was just about to leave .
There &apos;s still a lot to do .
Tom is home .
I told him to come .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
Tom had no money with him at that time .
Tom is going to be right back .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
I can &apos;t help feeling sorry for the girl .
She doesn &apos;t seem happy .
You &apos;re going to like working for me .
May I help you ?
Who saw you ?
I &apos;ve only seen Tom once .
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
Is this the train station ?
She is not tall .
I &apos;m sorry . I really have to go .
You can &apos;t just leave .
I know where to find water .
Who &apos;s going to do this ?
Are you sure this is what you want ?
They were never alone .
Do you know what time it is ?
Where &apos;s everyone else ?
We &apos;ll be happy to help .
Tom is watching .
What is the truth ?
Tom wants to play .
Your French is good enough .
I don &apos;t think we want to know .
I don &apos;t want to live here .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia in ages .
Who could forget it ?
I will stay until tomorrow .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to go .
I think we have enough time .
Tom is too good for Mary .
It wouldn &apos;t have mattered .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary knows why John doesn &apos;t like her .
Why don &apos;t you want to go ?
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
Tom knows you &apos;re here .
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
What have you done with the watch I bought for you ?
I will learn .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I need more time .
He had nothing to do with it .
I &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
Tom will be a good teacher .
We know all about you .
I want you to be with me .
You &apos;re hard to understand .
I want Tom to read this .
Tom has to go home now .
Tom has more books than he can read .
Tom looks like a woman .
I want to make her happy .
Tom became very ill .
I think he likes me .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
Money isn &apos;t everything .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
Everybody is alive .
You &apos;d better consult the doctor .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a brother .
Did Tom have his dinner ?
Tom will let you do that .
Mary is beautiful .
I think I need to see a doctor .
How have you been keeping ?
Where do you have to do that ?
Tom didn &apos;t hear anything .
Is your mother at home ?
Tom and Mary are doing that with John .
I don &apos;t want your money .
These books are my books .
I &apos;ll never do that again .
How are we going to get home ?
Can I speak to Tom ?
I don &apos;t know whether to go or to stay .
I could do nothing .
I know what that &apos;s like .
How are you , Tom ?
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
Tom knows too much .
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary .
Tom and Mary are playing with John &apos;s cat .
What &apos;s with Tom ?
He can &apos;t stay long .
You should listen to your wife .
Tom said that Mary may do that .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
I can &apos;t discuss it .
I want to live in Australia .
Where did Tom see you ?
I know what happened to Tom .
Tom will be absent today .
Can you really not swim ?
This house is mine .
Tom is really handsome .
I love you like a son .
You know Tom likes Mary .
How did it go ?
Tom has asked Mary not to do anything .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
I gave one to Tom , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he wants .
Tom is quite tall .
I thought you said you were bad at French .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
This one &apos;s for you , Tom .
Tom said he didn &apos;t need our help .
I don &apos;t know how long .
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to Boston without you .
We just need a little more money .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
You know where the problem lies .
My whole family &apos;s from Boston .
Might I ask you a question ?
Tom told Mary she was beautiful .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
Do you know where he lives ?
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
Can you hear it ?
How did you lose it ?
Tom asked us to help him .
I have enough money to buy this book .
Tom is always like that .
He knows no English .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French well and I don &apos;t either .
I only know what I &apos;ve been told .
This is what Tom wants .
Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
Tom just never should &apos;ve done that .
That was very good .
Nobody likes Tom .
That was the answer I wanted .
Those people over there are speaking French .
You don &apos;t know anything about me .
How &apos;s your sister ?
I need to wash my hands .
This is just the type of car I want .
I know you want to come home .
That &apos;s not very good , is it ?
You &apos;re my friends .
Tom &apos;s not going to be happy .
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend ?
It &apos;s what Tom wanted .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
None of your business .
I didn &apos;t even know that .
Is Tom big ?
Tom looked very sleepy .
You don &apos;t have to do this .
Do you want to know how ?
I don &apos;t have any more money .
I asked him his name .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
I think you &apos;ll find it .
Tell me where Tom lives .
If Tom doesn &apos;t eat this , please give it to Mary .
He can &apos;t buy a car .
Everyone is waiting for Tom to say something .
Tom can &apos;t help us anymore .
If I had time , I could help you .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was that old .
Did you forget something ?
We can talk about that later .
You &apos;re not one of us .
It &apos;s not difficult to speak French .
I know Tom &apos;s brother .
Mary is my girlfriend .
Tom is afraid .
I don &apos;t intend to go to Boston with you .
This isn &apos;t about money .
Thanks for this , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem like himself .
I &apos;m hit !
I think Tom is here .
I know that you know that I know .
I still have friends in Boston .
I don &apos;t really know why he wrote the book .
My father isn &apos;t at home .
What happened then ?
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
Is this your cat ?
No one could see us .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow if I can .
Tom may do what he wants .
It was a little fun .
We &apos;re going to Boston .
Where &apos;s Tom ?
I &apos;d like to give it to Tom .
She always gets up early .
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
Tom knows he &apos;s right .
She is a friend of my wife &apos;s .
Isn &apos;t that what they want ?
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
I like them both .
I don &apos;t believe anything Tom says .
Tom &apos;s sick .
I know Tom very well .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
I like them all .
I wanted to help you .
We &apos;ll have to leave town .
We don &apos;t need your help .
It &apos;s for you .
What is going on ?
Is that your mom ?
Who &apos;s not busy ?
We &apos;re available .
I must tell you something .
Who found you ?
Tomorrow may be too late .
I &apos;m sorry .
No one here knows anything .
Tom looks like he always does .
I don &apos;t think I know you .
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
He gave me several books .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to know .
People say that he &apos;s still alive .
He will be back in ten minutes .
I hope Tom is safe .
Tom wants his money today .
We speak French at home .
Tom may do that for you .
He asked me to wait there until he came back .
You can help .
He didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
Tom gave me this .
Who told you that I was sick ?
Tom ate .
Tom said he &apos;d do that .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
Tom wants to be at home .
Tom looks really good .
They aren &apos;t alone .
Tom needs this .
We found it here .
I think Tom knows why I &apos;m here .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
You can tell me the truth .
This is Tom .
Tom &apos;s very , very good .
I could scarcely believe it .
What did he do to you ?
I bought a lot of books .
Tom swims every other day .
I don &apos;t believe I &apos;ve heard that name .
What &apos;s on ?
I think I could learn a lot from you .
Maybe we can help Tom .
I want Tom to see this .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I have things to do .
Tom lives with his parents .
This is what I like about you .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s teacher is .
That &apos;s not true .
The doctor may have said so .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom will help us .
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
Tom was there .
Tom got home a couple of hours ago .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
We have everything here that we need .
This is Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
This is simple .
He had friends all over the world .
Tom tried to swim .
Can you do that here ?
They don &apos;t have a car .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants to do .
That &apos;s none of your business .
There has to be a way .
Tom is going to take you home .
See you at home .
This is a mistake .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday !
I wish I were by your side .
I don &apos;t often come to Boston .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
Is that what you want , Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t seeing Mary .
I still have a lot to learn .
I wish that I could do more .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
You should ask a doctor .
I need this job .
No one saw a thing .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
When will you leave ?
I &apos;d like to leave early .
Tom took a look at what Mary had written .
We study English at school .
Where are the others ?
It won &apos;t be a problem .
What was it like living in Australia ?
Tom came to help .
Are you tired now ?
If you don &apos;t want to do that , it &apos;s OK .
You don &apos;t need to go .
I think Tom may do that .
I only need Tom .
You won &apos;t be needing that again .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
The cat was on the table .
Tom has enough money .
It &apos;s not a watch .
He seems happy .
Tom almost never gets sick .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
I can &apos;t let you leave .
Can somebody help me ?
Tom has done that for three years .
Where is your sister ?
You should eat more .
Tom has to help Mary .
He looked as if he had been ill .
Do you want to tell me what happened ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
I came here to give you something .
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
What gives ?
Don &apos;t you want me to go with you ?
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
We need to leave .
I don &apos;t want to see this again .
Need anything else ?
He may be sick in bed .
We have things to do .
We have one for you , too .
Tom needs your help .
I feel better than ever .
Tom did what he wanted to do .
Tom is quite busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary is .
I forgot his name .
I think he has done it .
Who was right ?
He needs you .
She is busy at present and can &apos;t speak to you .
They have lost a lot .
I want time .
They may not be home .
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
If I were you , I &apos;d talk to Tom .
Tom is happy with it .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
You &apos;re welcome .
Do you plan to buy that car ?
It just doesn &apos;t matter .
Why are you asking me ?
What do you want to eat ?
I want to buy an automobile .
Tom knows something Mary doesn &apos;t .
Tom looked Mary in the eyes .
She got the money from him .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Tom knows where it is .
We &apos;ve got a problem .
I don &apos;t want you to be here .
Tom wanted to talk with Mary .
You know who Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
I asked him if he would help me .
Tom knows some French .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn &apos;t as busy as everybody else .
How is it going with your family ?
It &apos;s yours if you want it .
He stopped reading a book .
How was your night ?
I &apos;m not sure .
Do you really not know ?
Who is your teacher ?
Do you want to learn French ?
I &apos;m not family .
Tom made me do the work .
You &apos;re a problem .
You have my word .
Why is everyone afraid of Tom ?
Can you read ?
This book is very heavy .
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
We &apos;re frightened .
It &apos;s your move .
A lot has happened .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
Nobody tells me anything around this place .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
Tom did well .
I think Tom could learn a lot from you .
Mary was thinking about her question .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom will do it .
How long have you been learning French ?
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s happening here .
Why are people scared of you ?
I have a bicycle .
I think Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
I made it .
Mary is still living at home with her parents .
This doesn &apos;t happen every day .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Where are you going to be ?
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe it .
Can &apos;t you buy a car ?
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
Can you tell me the time ?
You are late .
Tom isn &apos;t a good teacher .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for Mary ?
We just weren &apos;t good enough .
I spent all day thinking about Tom .
I was starting to think you &apos;d forgotten .
Are you busy ?
You could have been happy .
Tom took my car .
I won &apos;t come .
I &apos;m busy now .
Why are you home ?
He &apos;s tall and handsome .
Did you meet her ?
Tom has to go home .
We were too late .
You &apos;re pretty good at that .
I think that you &apos;re right .
I saw a man with a child .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
Tom is not looking happy .
Where do I come in ?
What &apos;s Tom found ?
We &apos;re the problem .
Tom has been sick for a long time .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play outside .
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
The boy has a watch in his hand .
You can do what you want .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was ill .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see me like that .
He can &apos;t swim .
What did Tom want us to do ?
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
So what are you implying ?
That is her car .
It is none of your business .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has to do that or not .
I can hardly understand you .
Give them to me .
Have you eaten yet ?
I can scarcely believe it .
My mother made me what I am today .
We found something .
Tom only does what he has to do .
Tom can speak French .
I &apos;d like to be with Tom .
You are what you are .
Tom is too busy to help .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
I thought that you said you were bad at French .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money .
What could I say ?
I don &apos;t like English .
We left together .
I don &apos;t like the way he speaks to me .
I don &apos;t want to see you here again .
Wait five minutes , please .
Aren &apos;t you also from Boston ?
How can you eat so much ?
Tell Tom I want to see him .
Tom &apos;ll be here soon .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
It &apos;s not easy .
I didn &apos;t do anything .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
Tom walks quickly .
There &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to Australia .
I don &apos;t want to listen to you .
I wish I could go to Japan .
This dog isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
Tom can do it better than me .
Are you sure Tom is here ?
Yesterday he came back late .
I &apos;m hoping that Tom never does that again .
I don &apos;t have to say anything to Tom .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom who my father was .
You have many books .
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
We made many mistakes .
Tom and Mary have just left .
I do not know whether it is good or not .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Tom said it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
Tom will find something .
I think so , too .
Maybe I don &apos;t love you .
I was tired today .
I &apos;ll stay at home tomorrow .
Tom says he &apos;s busy .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s brother .
Tom came back soon .
Tom is your brother .
I forgot Tom spoke French .
Tom wanted to see it .
Tom knows what Mary likes .
He &apos;s my brother .
We &apos;re not entirely sure what the problem is .
You &apos;re big enough to do that by yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
I come from Japan .
I want to believe you .
Here is your dog .
They don &apos;t know about it .
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want kids .
What &apos;s Tom given us ?
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
She is getting on .
I can do it myself .
Let &apos;s walk .
You have to make Tom believe you .
Tom spends too much time working .
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
We want to help .
We don &apos;t do this often enough .
Tom is going to do that for you .
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
I have no books to read .
I don &apos;t know if Tom works there or not .
Tom is scared , but Mary isn &apos;t .
I could have bought that for you .
There &apos;s a dog by the door .
Tom has to tell the truth .
What is it that you want ?
Tom did a lot more than that .
It &apos;s work .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
Tom is really busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Can you see that ?
I really like you .
I like to be here .
You &apos;re always around .
I do not have a sister .
Let &apos;s always be friends .
We don &apos;t have that .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
I should &apos;ve gone home .
We &apos;re sorry about it .
Tom and Mary have gone to Australia .
I &apos;ll see you a week from today .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
You never should &apos;ve left your husband .
I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
I &apos;m coming with Tom .
I wish I could stay with you .
Tom knows what you said .
Is Tom still up ?
I &apos;ve got more books than I can read .
He asked me to do it .
I have to write a letter .
We still need your help .
Are we all here ?
Tom knows this .
He wants to see if he &apos;s still got what it takes .
I need you to do it yourself .
Can he speak English ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know you have a car .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
Has your father arrived yet ?
Tom &apos;s home .
I wrote this letter in French .
This is all I know .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
I didn &apos;t say anything .
It &apos;ll be fine .
I know where you can find Tom .
I asked what was wrong .
I would like to meet his father .
Tom didn &apos;t say that .
I will be back soon .
Tom asked Mary how she was doing .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
Tom must &apos;ve told us the truth .
It &apos;s never too late .
I will never make such a mistake again .
I want to speak with you .
My father was busy .
Tom is better than I am .
I may have to study French .
Where are my parents ?
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
Give it back to me .
We all have a lot to learn .
You have to give me more time .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that .
I will tell the woman what I know .
They want us to do it .
Mary has a new boyfriend .
Tom checked his watch .
You lost .
I saw that , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t tell me anything .
Tom wasn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom knew it .
We understand why .
I hope to hear from you .
Why are we going to Boston ?
We want it .
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
I saw something .
Tom thought Mary was in the room .
Tom is out .
He wasn &apos;t there last week .
I don &apos;t like doing this .
Tom is just like you .
This is all on me .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
Tom had three of them .
She isn &apos;t good enough for him .
It &apos;s going to be fine , you know .
I no longer want that .
Tom may do that again .
Is it good ?
I don &apos;t like what you said about Tom .
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
I was in Boston yesterday .
That &apos;s not yours .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t sick .
We &apos;ll talk afterwards .
Tom fell .
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
Tom may know where Mary is .
I like it here .
I asked Tom what was wrong .
Tom couldn &apos;t have helped Mary .
I gave him what money I had .
What is the doctor doing ?
It cannot last long .
We &apos;re taking off .
This table is the same as that one .
Here &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
I have to get back to Boston .
I &apos;d rather not meet him .
Tom wants to see his son .
You ought to know that .
I have to leave you .
Tom didn &apos;t have long to wait .
What &apos;s Tom got ?
I think Tom might know something .
It &apos;s what I want to do .
Tom and Mary used to often do that together .
I don &apos;t want anyone to see me like this .
School was fun today .
You always say that .
This is difficult .
You have to study harder .
I knew you &apos;d like it .
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
I &apos;m out here .
Can you hear me , Tom ?
I think he &apos;s happy .
Since I was tired , I went to bed .
It looks like no one &apos;s home .
Tom doesn &apos;t do much .
How long have you been in town ?
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
Let Tom drive .
You have to go home .
You can take your time .
Where is your room ?
I &apos;m still busy .
I made this for Tom .
You ought to write a book .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
Allow me to go with you .
That &apos;s not what I saw .
Tom doesn &apos;t like living in Boston .
Tom won &apos;t be here tonight .
I think no one knows .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
Are you scared ?
I hope so .
It won &apos;t take me a long time .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
I did that right away .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to read a book .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary here ?
I was there .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do this .
She was ill for a long time .
We both know that .
We have nothing to left eat .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom knows what Mary wants to do .
You know what to do , don &apos;t you ?
This house is very big , isn &apos;t it ?
These are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
This is my house .
Tell me everything you know about Tom .
I want to hear the truth .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
Why did you go to his house ?
You are here because we need your help .
Tom often comes to Boston .
I don &apos;t think Tom needs our help .
Is he right ?
This boy is my son .
This book is mine .
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
Tom can understand you .
Can &apos;t you speak English ?
Who doesn &apos;t do that ?
I feel well .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
I don &apos;t have much money .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
He never fails to do what he says .
Tom is going to be there , too .
This is Tom &apos;s bicycle .
We &apos;ll get it .
Nobody can help you .
I &apos;ll see you at home .
She knows nothing about your family .
Do you know about this ?
What do you know about what happened ?
What &apos;s ours is ours .
How are you feeling now ?
Thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
I just want to be happy .
You &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I guess I should &apos;ve done more .
I hope that Tom does that .
We want to see it .
Tom wants to live in Boston .
Tom is no longer a boy .
We &apos;ll be home soon .
I want Tom to go .
Tom went to bed .
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
I think you should tell Tom .
I want you to leave now .
Tom always gets up early .
We must go to school .
Tom has a dog .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
There &apos;s not much to say .
What &apos;ll you be doing ?
What &apos;s the time now ?
Anyone can do it easily .
We &apos;re not going to find anything .
I was late for work this morning .
Tom was there with his girlfriend .
You should have done so .
You may take the book .
I could hardly hear him .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
I ought to have written the letter yesterday .
He &apos;s already left .
I would like to tell you something .
I &apos;m going to come .
Tom has a big family .
Tom is going to be happy .
If I were you , I &apos;d ask him .
I want what you want .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
What do you like about Tom ?
He may be able to come tomorrow .
You &apos;re old .
I agreed with Tom .
I think I know him .
I &apos;ll get these .
I may have to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy .
I met him just now .
Tom has to do that , too .
I need to know tomorrow .
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
Don &apos;t give the dog anything to eat .
I saw nothing .
I want to know your name .
Do you want to know or not ?
He asked me whether I was busy .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can do that or not .
I need to go home .
How old are your children now ?
Tom was always there for me .
Give them to her .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how Mary will get to school tomorrow .
That &apos;s what Tom said .
I &apos;ll be back right away .
Why are your eyes so big ?
I need to talk to you .
What are you guys planning ?
What is the story ?
You need us .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
Tom is Mary &apos;s friend .
Where is your school ?
They don &apos;t want us here .
Perhaps Tom wanted to do that .
You aren &apos;t alone .
We really have to go back to Boston .
Tom hardly ever speaks to me anymore .
It &apos;s about time .
Where have you been this week ?
This happened before .
He was like a father to me .
Do you want me to go ?
You are a doctor .
Is that all you want to say ?
Can I help you ?
Tom is going to be with Mary .
Tom looks sleepy .
Tom can swim very well .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me ?
I know you better than your wife does .
How is it made ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
Tom and Mary were able to figure it out on their own .
Tom is here again .
Everybody &apos;s tired .
I let Tom do that yesterday .
Do you live here ?
You should know it .
I &apos;ll be good to Tom .
I said I &apos;m sorry .
They &apos;re not there .
How much food do you need ?
It doesn &apos;t look good .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had seen us ?
We don &apos;t want it .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Tom knew I was ready .
I think you know what to do .
This book belongs to Tom .
Do you really want to have children ?
How are things ?
Have you ever lost ?
He looked like a doctor .
That &apos;s what you told me .
We have to talk .
Why &apos;s Tom doing that ?
Tom was the one .
This is really big .
All my friends have children .
I think Tom is afraid of you .
Tom wanted to do everything himself .
Tom wants to take you home .
Can &apos;t we leave it as it is ?
You &apos;re not feeling well , are you ?
Please give me some water .
I know what I want to do .
Did Tom talk about it ?
Tom scares me .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
They &apos;re too big .
You must eat .
What &apos;s for dinner ?
What are you sorry about ?
You &apos;re not very happy , are you ?
This is Tom &apos;s school .
I saw her swim .
We &apos;ll do all we can .
She is not as beautiful as she was before .
You have to come home .
When you can &apos;t do what you want , you do what you can .
That &apos;s what works .
We won &apos;t need your help today .
It &apos;ll be a good day .
What &apos;s mine is yours .
Tom knew what to say .
I won &apos;t do that again .
I &apos;m back .
I &apos;m sorry I couldn &apos;t be more helpful .
Tom was just about to say something when Mary walked into the room .
That &apos;ll be nice .
This is very easy .
Tom told me he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
You &apos;re worried .
I &apos;m happy here .
You were absent from school yesterday .
I can go .
I need you to help me .
There are hardly any books in this room .
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
Have you told Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing it that way ?
I &apos;m not very good at French .
Where are you taking me ?
We have to do this .
I &apos;m also a teacher .
Tom has made a lot of mistakes .
I can &apos;t talk about this right now .
I want to be here with you .
Tom asked me if I knew his father .
When can I see you ?
What do you want to do about Tom ?
Tom and Mary work well together .
You &apos;ll be fine .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Do you know where they are ?
You should take it easy .
Can you come ?
Tom likes his job .
Can I help you folks ?
He can swim fast .
Is that where Tom is ?
People like to talk to you .
Thank you for this .
I &apos;m sorry , but he isn &apos;t home .
We had nothing to do with it .
Do you have any money ?
What did Tom tell Mary about John ?
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom again .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
You can count on him .
How &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
I can &apos;t help Tom with that .
Say what you want to say .
What should I do ?
I &apos;m old enough to be your father .
Tom won &apos;t know the answer to that .
I don &apos;t think Tom will like this place .
Have you told your mom ?
I &apos;ve never met her .
That &apos;s part of it .
I can &apos;t eat any more .
Why are you learning English ?
Do you have a car ?
Who are we ?
I &apos;ll tell you why I don &apos;t like Tom .
That &apos;s not what you said last night .
Tom goes to school with my son .
Who was it that gave you that ?
I bought this for my girlfriend .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his father .
I haven &apos;t heard from him for a long time .
Tom kept walking .
I &apos;m there for you .
Tom looked very old .
I could swim well even when I was a child .
Tom doesn &apos;t always come late .
I &apos;ll write to Tom .
Nobody wants you to do that .
We didn &apos;t do a thing .
They are teachers .
You &apos;re a woman now .
I won &apos;t tell Tom .
You won &apos;t believe this .
How long have you worked for us ?
I won &apos;t help you .
Tom asked for help .
I heard you talking .
Father wants to make me a doctor .
Where am I ?
I have many books .
How can I get to the station ?
I can &apos;t live like this anymore .
We &apos;ll meet right here .
I &apos;m old , but I &apos;m not that old .
I can &apos;t hear anything at all .
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
They &apos;ll come to us .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
He &apos;s your friend .
What did you do yesterday ?
You must do as you are told to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my dog .
You need it .
Tom has left .
Nobody likes her .
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
Tom lives and works in Boston .
We know what Tom wants .
That &apos;s the way .
How is your sister ?
Why were you eating by yourself ?
Are there any questions ?
I am very sorry .
All is well that ends well .
I looked at my dog .
Why did you buy this car ?
There is nothing that can &apos;t be bought with money .
I just hope no one saw me .
It never existed .
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary .
He will always be with you .
Was that fun to do ?
Tom likes to play with my dog .
What did you do last night ?
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Tom isn &apos;t always late .
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
That &apos;s what Tom wants .
Why isn &apos;t anybody doing anything ?
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston ?
Tom has been here for three hours .
I can &apos;t think of his name .
Tom has too many books .
He had no money .
Tell us how you did it .
Tom and Mary were there , too .
We need to talk to you .
You can &apos;t go yet .
What do you want , anyway ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
Give it up .
She &apos;s not a doctor .
I can only speak for myself .
Tom and Mary became teachers .
You should have stayed in the car .
I will buy a car .
How long will you stay in Japan ?
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
What do they want us to do ?
How long have you guys been standing there ?
Tom is alone in the house .
I heard you say that this morning .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
We understand each other .
What does that do ?
Can you please help ?
Tom has to speak French at work .
I can &apos;t go to work today .
Tom is from here .
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Perhaps I can help you .
I need to talk to Tom .
We &apos;ll have to do this later .
Can &apos;t they speak French ?
They are the ones who want to go .
I thought I heard you .
Tom was at home alone .
He speaks French .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
How long is he going to stay in Japan ?
That is the house where he lives .
Tom says he always told Mary the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary .
It must be here .
Tom was busy , so he couldn &apos;t help us .
He can &apos;t read .
I can hardly understand what he says .
I &apos;m almost sure .
Mary is as tall as Tom is .
We sure had fun , didn &apos;t we ?
I said we aren &apos;t going to do it .
He seems ill .
I &apos;ll be free tonight .
Is Tom alive ?
I &apos;ll be free all day tomorrow .
I already feel better .
I am not sure .
Tom is not home right now .
Tom said he was very tired .
You may speak to him .
I can &apos;t believe your mom let you go .
I would like to go to Japan .
You must help us .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I think Tom is happy .
What do you mean by it ?
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really Tom .
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
Both of you are right .
I don &apos;t want them .
Let them all come .
Is that what people do ?
Doing that would make me happy .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom said that he was afraid to do that .
I can &apos;t see anything .
Is Tom that good ?
Let me do it .
Are they still here ?
Tom always works a lot .
I &apos;ve got some questions for you .
What did that suggest to you ?
Tell me what I need to do .
I wish that I could do more .
I like Tom better .
What he says is true .
We ought to leave now .
Tom says he does that .
Tom is fine .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
I &apos;ve been busy since yesterday .
I only need one thing .
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
Why does Tom have to do that ?
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston .
Tom can &apos;t keep his eyes off Mary .
I wish it was that easy .
What do you want to see ?
What do you have to say about that ?
We can &apos;t do this ourselves .
Why not go to Boston ?
Allow me to buy that for you .
He doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
No one knows that I like you .
It &apos;s not about money .
Have you finished yet ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
That &apos;s better , isn &apos;t it ?
I still love you .
Tom is a good doctor .
What did she say ?
Ask me anything !
I want to talk to him .
Tom isn &apos;t leaving .
Your watch is ten minutes slow .
He hasn &apos;t been able to come because he is sick .
You must have made a mistake .
He is not coming , either .
Can we do that ?
I went to bed very late .
It &apos;s what Tom had .
Why are you here ?
Have you written to Tom ?
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
I tried to be like you .
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to help .
We &apos;re going to get you home .
He is as tall as my brother .
This cat is as big as that one .
How is it going with you and Tom ?
Tom is at school right now .
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said .
I don &apos;t know who you are .
Tom wants to talk .
Tom would do that .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
Tom tackled the problem immediately .
We should go inside the house .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
Tom made this for Mary .
If I have time , I &apos;ll do it .
It looks fine .
I asked Tom where Mary was .
I have one brother .
I know you &apos;re here , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the doctor .
Have you ever seen him swimming ?
You must see a doctor .
What time is it now in Boston ?
I can &apos;t believe that I &apos;m really here .
It almost happened .
You shouldn &apos;t go .
Tom looked sick .
Why do you want to buy this book ?
They know where Tom is .
We &apos;re workaholics .
Can anybody help me ?
Tom often talks with Mary .
I wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Keep the door closed .
There &apos;s nothing I can do .
Tom may not want to go .
You will never be alone .
They found it .
I might be able to help you .
Where are you ?
I don &apos;t think she would understand it .
Please don &apos;t ask me about Tom .
My father isn &apos;t home .
Tom and I &apos;ll meet you there .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
How many hours do you work per week ?
She went out of the room .
Tom realized that Mary was right .
I thought I &apos;d lost Mary forever .
Is he your teacher ?
I can &apos;t say exactly what the problem is .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
I &apos;m going to be late .
What &apos;s it look like to you ?
I think I know what to do .
What do you want to do with it ?
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
What time will you get to the station ?
What do you have ?
I saw you with Tom .
He listened to my opinion .
Tom looked pretty tired .
Mary didn &apos;t get along well with the other girls .
Are you Tom &apos;s mother ?
I have no friend to talk with .
Admit it , we &apos;re lost .
Tom made these for you .
You look very tired .
Tom and Mary are happy .
You &apos;d better go back home now .
I want to go to the city .
Tom needs to stay where he is .
I like Australia .
I love him more than anything .
I &apos;m all out of money .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
It &apos;s fine with me .
Have you heard this story already ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to help you .
That &apos;s what I think .
Tom should arrive in a few minutes .
Whatever you do , don &apos;t forget this .
Do you know why he couldn &apos;t come ?
Will you be at home tonight ?
This bus will take you to the station .
That &apos;s his house .
I can ride a bike .
Tom is always on the go .
I know you &apos;re not like Tom .
She is not always happy .
Tom isn &apos;t looking too good .
I told him everything .
What &apos;s good ?
Tom saw everything .
I &apos;m very happy about it .
Tom seems quite busy , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that today .
Come on , Tom . We &apos;re leaving .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
I hope to see you tomorrow .
We had a lot of fun together .
Where are my books ?
What did they say to you ?
I want to go swimming with a friend .
I heard that Tom wasn &apos;t a good teacher .
Is your mom here ?
I just need more time with Tom .
Maybe Tom is sick .
That &apos;s because you &apos;re a girl .
Tom had nothing to do .
He talks too fast .
She bought him a dog .
Tom is often absent .
If you &apos;re happy , I &apos;m happy .
What can I do for you this evening ?
It &apos;s as simple as that .
You don &apos;t need to be afraid .
I needed to talk to you .
Tom wants to go .
Tom , we have a problem .
I can &apos;t talk now .
I &apos;d like to say something .
These aren &apos;t yours , are they ?
Tom gave me a bicycle .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
They must have made a mistake .
I &apos;ve got a job .
I like her very much .
There must be another way .
What does Tom do every day ?
We have time enough to eat .
Why are you so busy today ?
Everyone was happy .
They are still children .
Tom has seen it , too .
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
My father has just come home .
The problem was too much for me .
I must be going now .
I think I just saw something .
I &apos;m not afraid at all .
You should have nothing to do with him .
I didn &apos;t intend to say that .
Did Tom tell you that ?
I want one !
I want to do this for Tom .
It &apos;s what I want .
You must have made a mistake .
What is good for you is good for me .
Tom needs your help to do it .
I know you &apos;ll be happy here .
What are you doing up ?
Tom asked Mary what she had been doing all morning .
When &apos;ll we know how Tom is ?
Can you help me ?
Do you want to go or not ?
I need to learn French .
I &apos;m not your boyfriend .
My mom is worried .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
You have to find Tom .
I don &apos;t want it .
My kids have all left school .
He is going to be a father soon .
How did you lose it ?
He is often late for school .
We &apos;ve all done that .
Tom , I want to stay with you .
Can someone help me ?
Tom has to go to work .
I need to ask you some questions .
We &apos;ve never done it before .
Let it be .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston ?
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
Tom is worried .
At what time will you be leaving ?
Tom told me so himself .
They &apos;re like family .
Who knows that ?
It won &apos;t be that easy .
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help .
You won &apos;t need that .
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
Tom has just come home .
I hope you like what I &apos;ve just given you .
She has the large house to herself .
Is he still here ?
I &apos;d very much like to know your opinion .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
Tell me the truth .
What &apos;s with you ?
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom had to stay in bed .
What are you after ?
They can &apos;t believe it .
I &apos;ll be reading a book .
Tom has gone to Australia .
I thought I &apos;d lost you forever .
Tom asked Mary if she needed some help .
This train is bound for Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
You really did a good job .
I thought Tom had stopped dating Mary .
I don &apos;t know why Tom &apos;s doing that .
I don &apos;t agree with you .
Are those for me ?
She doesn &apos;t always come late .
I didn &apos;t know what to say .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I &apos;m never late for school .
This isn &apos;t yours .
She pretended that she knew nothing about it .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
Tom lives there .
How are you today ?
I didn &apos;t know you had a boyfriend .
Tom came to see Mary .
You are old enough to know this .
Don &apos;t make Tom do that .
It &apos;s been nice talking to you , but I really must go now .
Tom is old enough to know better .
The dog likes you .
We can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about Mary .
He can only speak a little English .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
Everybody is very busy .
Tom found it .
He always tells the truth .
You can &apos;t buy it anywhere but there .
They &apos;ll understand that .
Did anyone tell Tom ?
Ask Tom what he &apos;s done .
Why are we studying French ?
Tom didn &apos;t know where Mary was .
I love that book .
We can &apos;t do it .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
That &apos;s me .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
You &apos;re stalling .
You must study more .
My mother tells me I have to go to bed by ten o &apos;clock on school nights .
This isn &apos;t for me .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
How old is your father ?
You want it , don &apos;t you ?
Can I work here ?
Tom is on his way to work .
He didn &apos;t see anything .
I was a little early .
Please tell me what that is .
I thought I heard you .
Please ask someone else .
We do what we want to do .
Tom looked very tired .
Tom wants a dog .
Tom can help you .
I &apos;d love to live in Boston .
I can swim fast .
This room has three windows .
Tom looks lost .
I don &apos;t have much time now .
I &apos;m sorry , but my mother is out at the moment .
It was nice talking to you .
You remember what it was like , don &apos;t you ?
Have you ever written a book ?
I expect to come .
I can &apos;t tell Tom the truth .
Tom knows who Mary is .
Tom didn &apos;t give me my money back .
How are you guys doing ?
Tom likes Mary , and so do I .
Say Tom , what &apos;s wrong ?
I thought Tom was your brother .
How tall you are !
What &apos;s Tom done ?
Tom is fast , isn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s for you to do .
Where do you want to eat ?
He and I are almost the same height .
Tom knew about this .
Tom saw Mary coming .
I &apos;ll need some help .
All we can do is to wait for him .
Tom went straight home after school .
I think that &apos;s common knowledge .
You drive .
I don &apos;t have anything to say to Tom .
I just want to be with you .
It &apos;s not always like this .
Who saw you ?
I think so , too .
You didn &apos;t actually see anything , did you ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom knew how to do that .
Tom is going to go to Boston by car .
The story cannot be true .
I don &apos;t know whether he will come or not .
I don &apos;t think so .
Much more can be done .
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
Nobody lives in this house anymore .
He is having dinner .
My father gets up early .
She can swim .
The question is who &apos;ll do it .
Tom likes to talk about himself .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
What makes people happy ?
I had fun .
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom does .
Tom was alone .
It was so simple .
Where is he ?
I came with Tom .
This is what you have to do .
Tom is much better at French than me .
He &apos;ll be back home soon .
I don &apos;t know what time it is .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow .
I don &apos;t want to go home .
I know that name .
I need you .
Who am I ?
Tom asked Mary if she knew John .
I don &apos;t know if I can stay .
I wish I had been with her then .
Please repeat after me .
Tom is better at speaking French than the rest of us .
Is this your cat ?
I can &apos;t believe you did this by yourself .
It &apos;s not hard to find .
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
This is the last time I &apos;ll ask you to do anything for me .
You made Tom very happy .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
Tom is lying in bed .
Tom has done that .
Where did you hear that ?
We don &apos;t have to read that .
I &apos;m being good to you this morning .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
You know it &apos;s not good .
How are you ?
I &apos;m not going to do it .
He gave me a watch .
I &apos;ve never done that before .
When did Tom say that ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
Tom lives here .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
What &apos;s your opinion ?
It &apos;s almost time to go to bed .
Just tell me where Tom is .
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
Why do you have to do it ?
We &apos;re not finished yet .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
We must find them .
He won &apos;t like this .
I will do anything for you .
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
Do you want to be my friend ?
Is Tom still on the job ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to see me .
It was too late .
This clock is out of order .
I had never done anything like that before .
Give me a little money .
I know what Tom saw .
It isn &apos;t going to be easy .
Come help me .
Tom knows what Mary is doing .
This one is for Tom .
Tom knows what he has to do .
Do you really want to know what I think ?
She is almost as tall as you .
How good was Tom today ?
We found it .
I think my mom knows .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom is telling the truth .
What Tom really wanted was to be happy .
I thought I heard something outside .
Can you read ?
Can you even speak French ?
Nobody &apos;s ever heard of him .
What &apos;ll you give me ?
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend anymore .
What don &apos;t you want me to see ?
Is that the train I have to take ?
We &apos;ll work .
Tom wanted to stay at home .
I know how to read French .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with you .
I must go alone .
Why do you keep giving him money ?
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
Tom is still in Boston .
That &apos;s what I love about you , Tom .
It &apos;s no trouble at all .
Did you complete the work ?
Is it hard to learn French ?
That belongs to me .
I don &apos;t like this book .
No one knows that .
She met him three years ago .
Tom should &apos;ve waited for us .
I found you .
I &apos;m going to school in Boston .
We have to get it done now .
Do they have that ?
I &apos;ve got no friends .
I have enough money to buy a car .
I &apos;ve got to know .
You &apos;re late again .
You haven &apos;t said anything to Tom , have you ?
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I could hear everything .
She is working night and day .
I want you here .
Please give me the letter .
What do you want us to do ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m still alive .
If that happens again , I &apos;ll leave .
Tom is no longer at home .
Please read the whole story .
Are you sure ?
She should listen more to other people .
What do you want me to do ?
That &apos;s not exactly true .
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
I should have left earlier .
Tom arrives today .
I can &apos;t tell yet .
He won &apos;t talk to her and she won &apos;t talk to him .
Tom has been doing that for a number of years .
Tom was outside .
If I had enough money , I could buy it .
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
I won &apos;t help you .
No one &apos;s going to find Tom .
Tom knew what kind of woman Mary was .
I have to live with it .
Do you know why that happens ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
Are you still here ?
She went home .
Tom should &apos;ve done it that way .
My parents are both from Boston .
Did you get their letter ?
That girl is good-looking .
People don &apos;t do that .
Tom &apos;s house is easy to find .
I &apos;m not that happy .
I need to know where you are .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
Take your time .
We have a lot of time .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary and she won &apos;t talk to him .
Tom should &apos;ve done that with us .
How many do you need ?
Can I bring you anything else ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been here today .
You &apos;d better leave now .
He can do it well , and you can do it even better .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
I came here to see Tom .
What is the matter with you ?
Tom is from Australia .
Don &apos;t let Tom help Mary .
Tom may have been there . I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m supposed to see Tom .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Where is his family ?
People don &apos;t do that .
Tom is back in Australia .
All the money was gone .
Has Tom really come back ?
I got here as fast as I could .
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Where do you work ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
Is Tom with you ?
Start the car .
Did you like this book ?
How long will this take ?
Do you want to do that ?
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
You &apos;ll see it .
Where &apos;s Tom anyway ?
I sure wish I could speak French better .
You speak French very well . I wish I could speak it as well as you .
Tom asked Mary how much money she had .
It &apos;s good to be home .
Tom has lots of friends .
I &apos;m not sure I want that .
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
Why is that ?
We &apos;ve got something for you .
She might come .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
I think that Tom can swim fairly well .
Are you from Australia ?
I can &apos;t let you do that .
This is your dog .
I also wanted to know .
No one knows what &apos;s really going on .
It is none of your business .
I have known that for a long time .
Tom walks fast .
When are you going to come home ?
I &apos;ll ask him .
I have to talk to Tom .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
I &apos;ve met you before .
Tom asked if what Mary said was true .
I liked that book .
We were happy .
What else can I do to help ?
There are a lot of people here .
This is where we live .
Do you know how to do that ?
Why is everyone looking at me ?
Tom came to Japan from Australia .
I &apos;m not here .
Tom won &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
Tom gets up early every morning .
We &apos;ll soon find out .
What were you doing that moment ?
Say it in French .
I imagine that &apos;s true .
I only have three dollars on me .
I want more money .
What I meant to say was that I didn &apos;t want to do that .
They didn &apos;t tell me so .
We study French at school every day .
How long have you been in Boston ?
She claims that she knows nothing about him , but I don &apos;t believe her .
I can &apos;t believe Tom bought that house .
She came alone .
You &apos;re driving too fast .
I almost feel sorry for you .
This car is mine .
Tom looked at his dog .
I like all of them .
How long have you been studying English ?
We &apos;re not home .
I want to live with you .
I &apos;m the new teacher .
I have lost my watch .
I want to read the book .
Why would I want to help Tom ?
I &apos;m going to be a teacher .
I wish someone would help me do that .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything .
Don &apos;t mention that to Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t think Tom will hurt Mary .
I can &apos;t talk now . I &apos;m too busy .
I &apos;m planning to come .
I like these .
I agreed with her .
He took back what he had said about her .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
This is for you .
I &apos;m getting by .
Tom is at home with Mary .
Why can &apos;t you come ?
I got it for next to nothing .
I &apos;ll be at home tomorrow .
Tom knows what to do .
Is it certain that he will help us ?
I haven &apos;t seen you in three years .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
Tom told me he hasn &apos;t done that yet .
Tom said Mary is very tired .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
They &apos;re almost three times as big as we are .
I &apos;d like to study with you tonight , but I can &apos;t .
I was happy .
What else do you know about that ?
Did you have fun in Boston ?
I didn &apos;t write this letter .
Tom is playing with his son .
I &apos;m tall .
Are you free ?
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
All Tom does is eat .
You had better not see her today .
Tom can &apos;t swim at all .
Tom is here with me .
I know that I &apos;m right .
She has a bicycle .
Why are you still here ?
You should listen to him .
This one &apos;s for you .
I &apos;m for it .
I don &apos;t know what to say to Tom .
She looks like a boy .
You &apos;ve done it !
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
Can Tom come tomorrow ?
Let me see how I feel tomorrow .
I &apos;m tired already .
You &apos;re Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom tried to leave .
What do you enjoy doing ?
I can &apos;t work like this .
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary .
Who will do it ?
Can &apos;t you help us ?
It &apos;s going to be good .
Give me the money .
I need them .
I want to live .
We &apos;ll see you when you get home .
I need water .
How long were you there ?
Tom is still a kid .
It &apos;s probably Tom .
Did you really do that ?
Do you know why Tom did it ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
Tom has been working here for over three years .
What year is it ?
Who saw you ?
Are you , by any chance , scared of me ?
Why are you looking at me like that ?
How do you feel about it ?
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
Tom said he needed more money .
My father is a doctor .
It &apos;s time to go home .
These are mine .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave Australia .
I said everything I had to say .
Are you finished here ?
It &apos;s your money , isn &apos;t it ?
He is a very good speaker of English .
Can you see them ?
We do what we want .
Leave it right where it is .
Aren &apos;t you from Australia ?
Even a child knows that .
When did he arrive here ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to go to Boston .
Tom works fast .
I will never be your friend .
Can someone tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
That &apos;s the way we like it .
I don &apos;t have a family yet .
I am not coming today .
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
I don &apos;t know what I have .
Tom wants to be happy again .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t very happy here .
I want to speak with you .
I don &apos;t know what to do either .
Here is my bicycle .
Why aren &apos;t you home ?
She bought him a car .
How many times a week do you study French ?
Why do you put up with that ?
How did you do it ?
Tom ate nothing .
What are they up to ?
See you tomorrow .
How long will you be staying here ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom was so old .
Tom and Mary are good friends .
I bought a watch .
I think I &apos;ll be going .
Do you have any more questions ?
This is from Australia .
We &apos;re working on it .
Where &apos;s Tom playing ?
Are we safe ?
I can tell you that it didn &apos;t happen .
I am not too tired .
It won &apos;t work .
You can hear everything .
Tom didn &apos;t do that for us .
You made too many mistakes .
Why can &apos;t Tom come ?
Tom and Mary think they know everything .
This is where I went to school .
No one is home .
I &apos;ve been alone for a long time .
This must be my book .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary .
That &apos;s one of mine .
Perhaps it &apos;s Tom .
I &apos;m not coming home .
We &apos;ll talk about that soon .
He can read .
Why are you guys here ?
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be there .
She came .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t together anymore .
We &apos;ll be in Boston all week .
I &apos;ve got some studying to do .
This book is for you .
Do you have the book ?
What kind of dog is it ?
I don &apos;t know where to wait for her .
These must be Tom &apos;s .
It wasn &apos;t hard .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d enjoy doing that .
That &apos;s too good to be true .
This is a very good question .
I have money .
I know you have a girlfriend .
Tom &apos;ll speak .
I have to go .
Have you eaten dinner ?
I think Tom is up to something .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
We don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
She really needs your help .
People make mistakes .
I was so happy .
He has to come .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
What else do you need ?
I &apos;m on my way to work now .
He says he will come .
What is it you want ?
Tom is home now .
Do you have a friend named Tom ?
Tom asked Mary for some money so he could buy something to eat .
I have to go to school .
Tom has gone to bed .
She forgot to write him .
I came yesterday .
What are you writing ?
Tom can do all that and more .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
Did Tom give it to you ?
I didn &apos;t go to school .
Mary is Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
That is what I have wanted to buy .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
My family didn &apos;t have much money .
You have a lot of books .
Why does Tom want to be a teacher ?
They won &apos;t know .
I have three children .
I can &apos;t listen to this anymore .
We want to have a baby .
I &apos;d better be on my way .
Have you eaten yet ?
It wasn &apos;t me . It was the cat .
Are you free tomorrow ?
I have to get that .
Tom looks tired .
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
What you need is a friend .
I don &apos;t think I like you .
I just love that .
What are you doing tonight ?
You must be the new teacher .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend .
I don &apos;t like either of them .
I &apos;ll have what he &apos;s having .
He cannot swim .
I saw Tom .
Where &apos;s my brother ?
I didn &apos;t mean to do it .
I won &apos;t forget it .
It looks like Tom is feeling much better today .
We need more .
What were you doing then ?
I &apos;m almost done .
Tom will do it when he comes in .
Is somebody there ?
Is that your book ?
She may not come .
I have finished my work .
There was no answer to my question .
I think Tom speaks French well .
What fun !
I can &apos;t talk to Tom right now .
Let &apos;s just be friends .
I don &apos;t go in for that sort of thing .
Is Mary Tom &apos;s mother ?
Tom is just going to need some time .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
I was in Australia last week .
They can &apos;t see me .
I &apos;ll ask Tom tomorrow .
You are not able to swim , are you ?
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
Tom lives in Australia .
We &apos;ll see you when we get home .
He doesn &apos;t know yet .
He may be on the next train .
I &apos;ll do what I need to do .
Those things happen .
I don &apos;t want to talk about school .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s taking Tom so long .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m going .
Give this book to Tom .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
I will write you back soon .
My mother always gets up early in the morning .
Do you know what this is ?
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
There was no need for you to do that .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
I love you , too .
She is free from care .
You &apos;re busy , aren &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s just money .
I heard you talking to Tom .
I like girls .
Tom stopped eating .
We know where it is .
This isn &apos;t about you , Tom .
I want to write a book .
I &apos;d very much like to go .
You &apos;re old enough now .
This really is something .
How long have you been here ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is busy or not .
I just came from my house .
There was someone else there .
Tom came by car .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
I know what we need to do .
Tom wants to go to Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed at home .
The teacher can &apos;t have said such a thing .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
I &apos;ve never been so tired .
What does it look like to you ?
I want some money .
Can your wife speak French ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He never saw his mother again .
Why does Tom do that to himself ?
He cannot have done such a thing .
Are they here ?
I think you &apos;ll want to see this .
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
Tom knows some French .
I will give you the money tomorrow .
We &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
He looks very good .
You &apos;ve told me that before .
I think about them often .
My father is a teacher .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
This is where Tom lives .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
It is exactly three o &apos;clock now .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
Nobody saw me .
Tom said good night to Mary and left .
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see it .
I know all of them .
I will not see him any more .
You &apos;ll learn a lot here .
We &apos;re not giving up on Tom .
I got you something .
Tom &apos;ll help .
We can still be friends .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom isn &apos;t at school .
She came into the room .
Your question does not have an answer .
It &apos;s as good as finished .
She is old .
Tom will never believe that .
You &apos;re in my way .
He had a dog .
I don &apos;t know what kind of car Tom has .
Tom wants something , but I &apos;m not sure what .
Tom wanted some food .
That &apos;s what Tom tells me .
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
He gave in .
Tom now knows what he has to do .
Tom won &apos;t be back .
He is no longer here .
I won &apos;t go .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet .
Tom arrived back home safely .
Who wrote the letter ?
I have family in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t see it like that .
I &apos;m leaving now .
Let &apos;s take a train .
Where are you taking us ?
I no longer need it .
They heard Tom .
Have you already eaten ?
We are going to meet him tonight .
I can &apos;t believe I actually said that .
It &apos;s what I want .
Tom wondered what Mary would say to John .
You need not do it at once .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
We &apos;re reliable .
It matters to me .
I have another job now .
You can eat whatever you like .
I &apos;d like to see them both .
I &apos;ve always wanted a child .
It was time to leave .
Is he Tom ?
What time is it now by your watch ?
I &apos;m sorry , but Tom isn &apos;t home .
How much money do you have with you ?
You know Tom is telling the truth .
He is eating .
Where &apos;s my family ?
Do you know what happened ?
I think Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
I believe you know what I mean .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
Thank you for coming .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my friends .
I think I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
No one knows we &apos;re here .
I ate too much yesterday .
I am no longer a child .
Tom has to stay .
I don &apos;t know his name .
Maybe Tom gave it to Mary .
I &apos;m not happy about this .
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
I &apos;ve always been here .
Tom must have seen something .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten yet .
What does your sister do now ?
Who found this ?
Tom asked Mary to stay .
Tom looks like his father .
Is he a friend of yours ?
It &apos;s a family trait .
Tom had money , a lot of it .
Can you help ?
He seems to have been ill for a long time .
Is he a teacher ?
I think that she will not come .
Add more water .
She asked him for help .
I think I &apos;m right .
Tom was real happy .
I bought it for 10 dollars .
He is ill .
Tom doesn &apos;t look anything like his brother .
I &apos;d like to tell her that I love her .
I gave it to Tom .
Thanks for your reply .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;ll come .
You have to leave Boston .
I haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .
You don &apos;t need to go .
There &apos;s nothing more you can do for me .
Are you busy ?
You don &apos;t want to do that .
He &apos;ll be here soon .
It &apos;s not Tom .
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
He has made me what I am today .
What did you find ?
I can do it by myself .
You really should &apos;ve gone by yourself .
Tom arrived very late .
We have a lot of things we need to do .
I cannot understand it .
We study French together .
My brother is in Australia now .
I go to school every day .
Tom didn &apos;t have the time .
When did you go to work ?
Nobody likes them .
Where &apos;s the dog ?
I don &apos;t know the reason why she isn &apos;t coming .
They won &apos;t have arrived yet .
This is a question for Tom .
I &apos;ll be back in a couple minutes .
I think they &apos;re happy .
I know exactly who it is .
Tom saw Mary today .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
I like Boston , too .
Are you sure you can do this ?
That &apos;s not what Tom wants .
My parents are out of town .
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
I need to speak with you right away .
We play games together .
We &apos;re not going with you .
Maybe he will arrive tonight .
Is there anyone else ?
Tom left Mary behind .
You should know that .
I &apos;d love to see you .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
This is easy .
Tom is a friend .
I &apos;m coming .
Tom has a sister in Boston .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
Is she here yet ?
Can I bring you anything else ?
I found out what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I don &apos;t see what that has to do with this .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
You should learn how to ride a bicycle .
You know what you said .
No one saw Tom .
When do you want it ?
What about you , Tom ?
It &apos;s merely a joke .
Tom is quite good at his job .
Tom says he &apos;s tired .
Tom is in his room .
I was just trying to help .
What does he plan to do ?
I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
It &apos;s been a long night .
Tom is in the car .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Tom is a dad , too .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
She became very ill .
What does Tom want to do ?
Tom &apos;s not in .
We came to see you .
We have to tell Tom what has happened .
Have any of you seen Tom ?
How long have you been in this town ?
I don &apos;t have a lot of money on me .
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom and I became very good friends .
Tom told me that he would help us .
We can &apos;t wait .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom do that ?
Tom has lost his job .
Where &apos;s your car ?
You &apos;d better not wait here .
Tom no longer works here .
Who &apos;s coming with me ?
I saw your father .
I love my home .
There &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
Please do not try this at home .
They &apos;re not always there .
Tom gave Mary everything .
I told Tom the truth .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
Tom is doing fine in school .
I can help you if you let me .
I &apos;m really bad at doing stuff like this .
Is that possible ?
This is Tom &apos;s room .
This is something Tom made for you .
She devoted herself to him .
Tom would like to study French .
I don &apos;t think I want to know .
How often do you come to Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened because he wasn &apos;t there .
Tom just ate .
Tom still has a lot to learn .
Has anything like this ever happened to you before ?
I will go if I must .
Tom needs your help to do it .
I knew that already .
He is as tall as her .
You must learn French .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s watch .
I &apos;ve got just about everything I need .
Tom did this .
I &apos;ve only been to Boston once .
He said that he would help me .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
I think that there is a man there .
I was the one who said we should wait .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
This never would &apos;ve happened if you &apos;d done it the way I told you to do it .
I said I &apos;d wait for Tom .
Where am I now ?
Tom knows how to do this .
Tom was looking quite happy .
Tell me what you know .
I don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
Tom comes from Australia .
Maybe what Tom said was true .
You can &apos;t just not do your job .
Are you with Tom ?
Haven &apos;t you ever visited Boston ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I will give it to you .
Tom asked Mary if she was busy .
Tom had fun .
He has hardly any money , but he gets by .
We &apos;re not going to give Tom the money he asked for .
What did you have for supper last night ?
I must have lost it .
Nothing happened .
Tom can &apos;t swim as well as Mary can .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
This one &apos;s from me .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
Can you help us ?
She is now well enough to work .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
I met Tom yesterday .
We &apos;ll have to do something .
I &apos;m not sure he wants to talk to me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary &apos;s school .
What do you want with me ?
What happened to the money ?
I wish he were here .
When did you meet her ?
No one &apos;s going to see me .
Tom &apos;s up .
Do you know what they want ?
We &apos;re both very frightened .
Tom speaks quickly .
They don &apos;t know my name .
Tell Tom what this is .
We saw them leave .
Tom has a girl back home .
These are ours .
I don &apos;t want Tom there .
Tom would never do something like that .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait that long .
I want something to eat .
We don &apos;t have it .
He is as busy as ever .
I &apos;m scared .
I &apos;m busy , too .
It seems that Tom can &apos;t swim .
She can &apos;t have written it herself .
The question is how he will get the money .
I went into Tom &apos;s room .
We don &apos;t need to go to school tomorrow .
I want to see this .
I suppose he &apos;ll come .
What does this have to do with us ?
I &apos;m sorry that I haven &apos;t been able to be here for you like I should have been .
I wouldn &apos;t want to keep Tom waiting .
No one saw me .
I don &apos;t have a brother .
Tom said something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
This is where Tom stays when he &apos;s in Boston .
How could I help you ?
Tom was eating .
It &apos;s too big .
How many hours a day do you study French ?
It was too easy .
We &apos;re certain .
Where have you been , Tom ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom playing with us ?
Where &apos;s Tom when you need him ?
That &apos;s my sister .
I need to talk with Tom .
She needs it .
We need your help .
Tom only does what he has to do .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Where do they live ?
I would like to see that .
You are to come with me .
I didn &apos;t see you coming .
He looked well .
You ought not to have done that .
Are you here ?
What &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
It makes all the children happy .
We &apos;ll take it .
It may be true .
I just want to find out what happened .
He doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom is already here , but Mary isn &apos;t here yet .
Tom looked pretty tired .
May I ask why ?
We can do much better .
He doesn &apos;t always come late .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary doing that .
We found them here .
I know what he did .
Are you certain about this ?
Tell Tom not to tell Mary .
There are just two of us .
They &apos;re afraid of us .
These people have lost everything .
Tom is busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t need a girlfriend .
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
What about this one ?
I went outside early in the morning .
We don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m very tired from work .
Don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going on ?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
He did not come back before ten o &apos;clock .
This book is easy to read .
Tell it to him , not me !
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
What does Tom look like ?
It was Tom &apos;s .
What makes you happy ?
I didn &apos;t know what else to say to Tom .
He &apos;s no doctor .
You &apos;re going to be so happy here .
She will give you what money she has .
I have to go to work .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know any French .
Tom is in Boston .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
I don &apos;t know them .
Why are we doing that ?
I only have two children .
I hope no one saw you .
I canceled .
I did it for you .
I can &apos;t forget her .
How did you see that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to be here .
I don &apos;t think Tom can be left alone .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d do that .
We &apos;re still in Boston .
You should &apos;ve told me yesterday .
Tom and Mary both don &apos;t understand French at all .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom saw Mary at the station .
Tom has never done anything like this before .
Is this yours , Tom ?
I don &apos;t know why everyone &apos;s so tired .
Tom is out of the office .
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
Everyone &apos;s saying it .
Tom can &apos;t swim yet .
He has not been able to attend school for a week .
I will never tell !
I have to stay in bed all day .
I have no plans for tonight .
Tom could &apos;ve figured that out without any help .
Tom speaks French better than English .
No one knows where we are .
I &apos;m really fast .
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
I only have time for coffee .
I dislike Tom .
Why do we have to do this ?
Let &apos;s do this later .
I am sure I saw her two years ago .
I don &apos;t like what &apos;s going on .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes it .
I &apos;m Tom and this is Mary .
I &apos;ve done everything I was supposed to do .
I might not go swimming today .
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
Did Tom say where we should meet him ?
It serves you right .
This bicycle is mine .
It isn &apos;t good .
Do you have kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to want Mary to do that .
I don &apos;t go to school .
I found some money .
You can go home if you like .
It &apos;s difficult to help people who don &apos;t want your help .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
It &apos;s better you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m at home .
Tom is good at French .
Tom saw him .
I &apos;m not your son .
Tom still didn &apos;t know what to do .
I just saw Tom and Mary together .
Tom never showed up last night .
Tom wants to go , too .
Tom looked very tired when he got home .
I want to be a good father .
We can &apos;t leave Boston until we finish this job .
Where did you see the woman ?
What &apos;re they doing ?
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
You don &apos;t work here .
Tom took a look around the room .
This is what we want to know .
Is this too big ?
There it is .
I hope it &apos;s not true .
Those are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
I want to see that again .
What do you have for me today ?
What &apos;ll Tom do with that ?
Why isn &apos;t it good ?
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
They will help .
I &apos;ll listen to you .
What &apos;s Tom going to do ?
Tom gave it a try .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
This house belongs to Tom .
I want to be as happy as Tom .
I &apos;m not as heavy as Tom .
I &apos;m going to go home .
Are we done ?
We have to have this .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
Tom has gone home early .
We want to help Tom .
Someone is at the door .
Don &apos;t you want to play with Tom ?
I can &apos;t work for you .
Why don &apos;t we eat at a restaurant tonight ?
Everybody &apos;s happy .
I do want to see you .
Tom knows nothing about Boston .
Did you eat too much ?
Tom said that he &apos;d go to Boston .
I lost sight of Tom .
Nobody &apos;s seen Tom .
Can you give me a hand with this table ?
What do you mean by that ?
Tom has nothing to do here .
Let me have a look .
If you really don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
My sister can swim very fast .
I want Tom .
I feel so happy when I &apos;m with you .
Tom wasn &apos;t alive .
What do you want to be ?
Tom had nothing to do with this .
She looks happy .
It has to be true .
Have you told me everything ?
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
Tom need not have worried .
What time is it in Boston ?
I don &apos;t know anything about him .
We don &apos;t have to be here .
Tom gave me a hard time .
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be .
Tom can drive a car , too .
You need a lot of water .
Are they your friends ?
You must do as you are told .
Tom wanted this .
We have plenty of time .
I love coming to Boston .
What did you do yesterday ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re alone .
I have to speak with you .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a dog .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know how to do it .
What does he want to do ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about my family .
That &apos;s not all Tom said .
I &apos;m not your brother .
Your house is big .
Are we all happy ?
What are you planning to do ?
They need help .
I want to travel to Australia .
Is this your opinion ?
I &apos;ll do it again .
All of us can speak French .
Maybe he was ill .
There is a woman who wants to see you .
That isn &apos;t really going to happen , is it ?
Where &apos;s my car ?
I know Boston very well .
I don &apos;t know what Tom has to do .
I said that .
They won &apos;t hurt you .
Tom may be on the next train .
Tom wasn &apos;t busy .
We saw you .
I &apos;m coming to Boston .
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
I believe in him .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid .
I didn &apos;t hear him coming .
I &apos;ll go to school .
Are you through with your work ?
He is still in bed .
Can I help you ?
Tom proceeded to the next question .
I didn &apos;t need to do that .
I think we should follow Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my family .
Why aren &apos;t you at home ?
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
I know how hard this must be .
How many times do I have to tell you ?
I want one like that .
We &apos;ll be busy .
He made her happy .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
I don &apos;t like it .
I was tired , so I didn &apos;t do that .
Who &apos;ll come ?
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
What do you want me to tell Tom ?
I &apos;ll be with you in a second .
Tom knows we aren &apos;t happy .
What &apos;s the point ?
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I do not think that he will come .
Tom seems really happy .
Did you like Tom ?
That has nothing to do with you .
I said go home .
What time will we arrive in Boston ?
Where are we ?
Tom never gives me anything .
I think it &apos;s time for me to leave for school .
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
She is only a child .
This is all I have to say .
Tom had a lot to do .
Tom is the one who wants to wait .
That bicycle is mine .
I think I know why .
I want to see Tom so bad .
I &apos;ve got to do this now .
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
They &apos;re children .
That &apos;s a very good car .
Tell Tom that we &apos;re leaving .
I want to do this .
Tom &apos;s well .
That &apos;s your funeral .
I thought that Tom loved Mary .
Tom hasn &apos;t given us anything .
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say .
Tom can &apos;t work tomorrow .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
Both Tom and I were scared .
Why are they here ?
Tom wants three of them .
That is my dog .
We have three minutes .
I like you just the way you are .
That &apos;s how Tom did it .
I don &apos;t know him at all .
Thanks for the food .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
You know why I &apos;m here , don &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s where I want to live .
Why is everyone looking at us ?
You &apos;re so right .
Nobody wants you to do that .
It &apos;s not too much .
Were you telling the truth ?
I no longer need to work .
I &apos;m going to wait here for you .
I don &apos;t like my job .
I don &apos;t know that much about you .
Tom is big .
I saw one .
I think he has done it .
Tom didn &apos;t know what I was trying to do .
He doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
How was your night ?
Did you give it to Tom ?
I thought Tom lived in Boston .
Why don &apos;t you say something ?
I like them both .
That &apos;s just what you need now .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
What would I do without you ?
I haven &apos;t heard that word in a long time .
Tom and I are very busy .
He has a little money .
My English is not good at all .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
This isn &apos;t about me or Tom .
Tom knew what to do .
I &apos;d like to see that .
Tom would never do anything like that .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy everything we need .
Why &apos;s Tom like that ?
I want to go to Boston .
What made Tom do that ?
Tom and the others left early .
My father is busy .
Tom wasn &apos;t alone .
I hope this never happens again .
Do you really want to know what happened ?
I didn &apos;t say that .
I have to stay home .
That &apos;s not what we do .
She testified that she saw the man .
Why do I need to speak French ?
Do you want to take this one ?
I love Tom &apos;s car .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
Tom speaks good French .
Do you have a family , Tom ?
Who will come with me ?
That &apos;s from Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
I have a few books .
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary .
I know you want to go home .
I have a different job now .
Tom speaks French fairly well , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom can read well .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
I &apos;d like that .
They don &apos;t want you to know .
Who is he ?
How is Tom now ?
You shouldn &apos;t have done it .
We never talk .
Do you study French at school ?
Tom is not in .
I can &apos;t believe it either .
Why do you want to do this ?
That would be fine .
Tom is kind of tall .
I &apos;m still Mary &apos;s boyfriend , I think .
We can talk .
I only wanted to talk to Tom .
I &apos;ve found Tom .
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
I saw Tom tonight .
Why does Tom want to do that ?
I &apos;ll be OK .
What were Tom and Mary doing here ?
Those are our books .
I can &apos;t believe I just said that .
He can be relied on .
There was only one problem .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
I can &apos;t be something I &apos;m not .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
It serves you right .
You got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
Can we talk ?
The kid already speaks pretty well .
Do you know where your children are ?
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
I am fine .
He kept me waiting for a long time .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want that .
I know that she is beautiful .
Tom knows what you did .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom does that , doesn &apos;t he ?
Thank you for coming .
Where are Tom and Mary ?
There &apos;s not enough water .
Tom doesn &apos;t want this .
How much is that all together ?
I thought Tom was meeting us here .
I don &apos;t think Tom is home .
You don &apos;t understand .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about money .
How are you going ?
Tom might know something .
We &apos;re at home today .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t need my help .
He did not say a word to us .
Let &apos;s have dinner .
We know where Tom is .
I wish I had more time to talk with you .
I have a problem .
I think Tom is old .
It &apos;s my mistake , not yours .
You are my father .
Tom and I are both a little busy right now .
I just got a letter from my girl .
I didn &apos;t hear you coming .
You want to go to Boston with Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has a new girlfriend already .
How did you come by that much money ?
Everything depends on what you will do .
I thought Tom had a dog .
They are leaving Japan tomorrow .
Don &apos;t you want to study ?
What are you sorry for ?
Tell Tom about it .
I &apos;m not feeling very well .
What are you going to have ?
I &apos;ve only had one boyfriend .
Why can &apos;t you come ?
This is no good .
I &apos;d like you to have it .
Aren &apos;t we friends ?
I wish you had more time for me .
I will learn .
They don &apos;t have to go to school today .
If you want to be alone , I &apos;ll leave .
I think you &apos;re right .
I like this book better than that one .
I don &apos;t want to meet Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t coming .
Thanks for being you .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
We &apos;re going to do that .
We &apos;ve got a lot to do .
I already knew this .
What &apos;s your take on this ?
We &apos;ll do everything we can .
You &apos;d better stay here .
You &apos;d better not go there .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
It &apos;s your bedtime .
I hope to see my parents tomorrow .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
I want to help if I can .
Tom wants to come .
Who likes Tom ?
I was very busy yesterday .
I still want to talk to you .
I don &apos;t like that word .
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
It can &apos;t be true .
What did you wear ?
I could &apos;ve helped you .
Tom asked again .
How old is this dog ?
Tom is arriving soon . You should get ready .
You have friends here .
Did you do that ?
I don &apos;t know Tom , but I know his sister .
She was on her way to school .
I have to know what &apos;s going on .
We know where it is .
I &apos;ll do what I have to do .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
Tom may do that .
You make me happy .
It doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
Are you happy , Tom ?
You know , don &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s not my opinion .
When I grow up , I want to be just like you .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I never said that .
We aren &apos;t going .
I forget her name .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry .
I don &apos;t want to be seen with him .
What has he done ?
It &apos;s a bad time .
The work here is fairly simple .
He is not as tall as his brother .
You should &apos;ve done it .
I asked Tom not to tell Mary .
This car is my father &apos;s .
Do you have any more questions ?
That &apos;s up to Tom .
I think I could help .
I want the other one .
I have a brother in Boston .
The money is gone .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me what I want to know .
Let &apos;s live here .
The family wants to buy a house .
You know how it is .
I haven &apos;t seen anything of her lately .
I would like a word with you .
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
I &apos;m not going to go with you .
Do you know anything about his family ?
How are you going to do that ?
I &apos;m going to go find Tom .
That doesn &apos;t matter .
I wish I could help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about me .
Tom wished he had more time .
Who goes there ?
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary was .
Tom likes that one .
I might be a few minutes late .
I wasn &apos;t afraid .
Was it fun to do that ?
What did Tom do then ?
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Where are the other girls ?
I don &apos;t like your dad .
You know it better than me .
You haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
We &apos;re a family .
It &apos;s just too soon .
I am not acquainted with him .
Just say you &apos;re sorry .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend anymore .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
Tom canceled .
Is this baby a boy or a girl ?
Tom eats more food than Mary does .
She avoids me .
I have no time to write to her .
Why do they do it ?
You never should &apos;ve let Tom go to Boston with Mary .
Tom knew that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom isn &apos;t himself .
I &apos;ve got something you both need .
I love my dog .
You gave it to me .
Where does this book go ?
He wished he had more time .
What do you like about me ?
Tom wants to study French .
I hope to hear from you soon .
Where are we right now ?
He is my teacher .
We don &apos;t have long .
I really don &apos;t have much time .
He gave it to me .
Tom is in his room now .
The police are there .
I don &apos;t know what Tom did with it .
I know what that is .
What do they do there ?
I think he did it .
I &apos;m not busy .
We &apos;re always right .
It &apos;s time for you to go to bed .
Tom is very sick .
What did he say ?
Tom will work .
Tom considered it .
Where is he playing ?
Maybe we should help Tom .
I &apos;ll say it again .
We can make this work .
I &apos;m free tonight .
I think that my mom knows .
Tom &apos;s French isn &apos;t very good .
You &apos;re not answering the question .
They &apos;ve gone .
I &apos;ve told you the truth .
Who &apos;s going ?
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I &apos;ve got to go .
When will you be free ?
Give me the watch .
He told me the truth .
You &apos;ve done it again .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
How &apos;s your mother ?
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
I went into the house .
What do you want to be ?
I think it &apos;d be fun .
Tom said Mary isn &apos;t happy .
It gets better .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that &apos;s what Tom needs .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything all day .
I believe Tom knows .
Tom went out of the room .
He spends a great deal of money on books .
I just didn &apos;t know what to say .
He never saw his sister again .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is doing .
They &apos;re too big .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
She knows what you did .
I came here yesterday .
Let me go with you .
Why should I be scared ?
May I do it right now ?
I &apos;m doing fine .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
What makes you happy , Tom ?
She will never talk about it .
You don &apos;t have to come .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
You &apos;ve never had a girlfriend , have you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been here in a long time .
We have a long ways to go .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
You &apos;re not my brother .
Do you really want to know ?
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll find a way .
Tom isn &apos;t happy to be here .
I &apos;m going to be fine .
I don &apos;t want you to be late .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
He came here ten minutes ago .
Are you a teacher ?
Let Tom do anything he wants .
Tom returned a few hours later .
When was the last time you saw Tom at school ?
I am not frightened of anything .
I &apos;m sorry . I don &apos;t have a lot of time .
Tom wanted to buy it .
I had so much fun doing that .
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us .
What &apos;s going on with Tom ?
They can &apos;t see you .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Please have someone else do it .
Tom must have been at home at that time .
Tom is very busy right now .
Tom can drive .
Children really do grow up quickly .
I hope to see you soon .
It &apos;s time for me to go .
I &apos;d rather not do that .
Tom is never coming back .
I &apos;m certain that he &apos;ll come .
You give up too easily .
If I had money , I could buy it .
It &apos;s not there .
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
It &apos;s not safe here .
Will we be there soon ?
Give it back .
You can &apos;t swim , can you ?
Tom asked Mary if she loved him .
I &apos;m sure he will come tomorrow .
Tom and Mary are at home today .
Tom isn &apos;t doing so well .
I want to ask Tom what he &apos;ll do .
I will wait .
I asked him to drive me home .
He was absent from school for a week .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us ?
You should listen to your wife .
The house was big .
It &apos;s my life .
I thought that I saw something .
Tom has finished .
There is always something to do .
I wish I could have gone with her .
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
We found it here .
He left immediately .
I &apos;m still the same person I used to be .
Tom lives here alone .
Where do I find that ?
I won &apos;t talk to you .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
You should &apos;ve been here .
Why did you do that ?
How about you ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell me .
We need them .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know that .
We can &apos;t talk here .
I &apos;ll be with you in a few minutes .
Who &apos;s your dad ?
We &apos;ve found it .
I am pretty sure .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
Tom has almost finished doing that .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
How beautiful she is !
He is my father .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
Who was it ?
I &apos;ve always wanted to do this .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
You should &apos;ve listened to me .
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Tom had to stay at home all week .
I &apos;m sorry Tom isn &apos;t here .
Did you write this book ?
What did you do this week ?
If I were you , I &apos;d go home right away .
I &apos;m with Tom .
They all look the same .
You do understand me , don &apos;t you ?
I have to go ask Tom .
Where is your brother ?
Can &apos;t this wait until tomorrow ?
Can I wait for Tom here ?
I knew what I was supposed to do .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
Tom needs that money .
Do you not know who I am ?
I shouldn &apos;t have told you this .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
Do you want me to go with Tom ?
Tom saw it .
Just say what you want to say .
That &apos;s no problem .
Everyone is doing it .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
There &apos;s a man here that wants to see you .
I know what they said .
It appears you &apos;re correct , Tom .
I know where you can find Tom .
I &apos;m about ready .
That was easy .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom yet .
Tom saw you .
I &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
I don &apos;t have to be here .
I want to hear what Tom has to say .
That was two years ago .
You have him there .
Tom wants Mary to want him .
People often tell me more than I want to know .
We &apos;re safe here .
Tom looks like a girl .
It isn &apos;t there .
Hand it to Tom .
If Tom goes swimming , so will I .
She wasn &apos;t able to meet him .
Tom told Mary what John wanted .
Tell me what I have to do .
What &apos;s the matter , Tom ?
I &apos;m able to read French .
Do you have money ?
She gets up early .
We shouldn &apos;t swim here .
Maybe I should &apos;ve told Tom .
Tom always tells the truth .
I won &apos;t assist you .
I have to go to bed .
He is as tall as my father .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t need to know about this .
Who gave that to you ?
Tom is a lot better at it than I am .
You &apos;re up early .
I want to watch this .
Could we talk about last night ?
If only I could speak English !
All you had to do was ask .
I have time tomorrow morning .
You know that , don &apos;t you ?
Why are you alone ?
You know Tom is telling the truth .
He wanted to buy the book .
I &apos;m not sure I want to do this .
Tom has to do it .
It &apos;s too good to be true .
I &apos;m very busy these days .
That was a mistake .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s a doctor .
How &apos;s Tom today ?
This car is his .
You don &apos;t want that , do you ?
Tom asked me to help him .
Tom is unrelated .
He won &apos;t live a long life .
How did you lose it ?
Tom gave me a book .
Maybe Tom shouldn &apos;t be here .
I &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
Tom is in his room now .
Tom looked again .
Tom says he &apos;s not going to do that .
It &apos;s great to see you .
What you did made Tom happy .
Tom was sick last week .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
He is his friend .
We &apos;re almost home .
It seems that Tom has been here .
Can I take your word for it ?
I &apos;ve met you before .
I won &apos;t be back for a while .
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
Why did you come home so late ?
I think I &apos;ll be leaving .
You are a woman .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
She gave him some money .
Did Tom find it ?
I &apos;ve heard of you .
You &apos;ve come too early .
Tom has a new woman in his life .
Tom said he &apos;d be leaving soon .
Give it to me , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about it .
Why are we still here ?
I like Tom , too .
You can &apos;t leave yet .
Tom loves being outdoors .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows about this yet .
Who &apos;s supposed to eat all that ?
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
He wants to be like me .
We have been good friends for ten years .
My mother is sick in bed .
I don &apos;t need a boyfriend .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
What &apos;s taking Tom so long ?
I am tired of the work .
It was big .
There seems to be a mistake .
I like to eat .
Tom wants to be a doctor .
Tom &apos;s scared .
Tom is a lot busier this week than he was last week .
You have to ask Tom first .
It looks like Tom is fine .
We &apos;re both very tired .
How do you pronounce that ?
We &apos;ll take it .
Tom got a job .
You know I have to go .
I &apos;ve visited Boston before .
You don &apos;t have to help .
I want to stay here .
That could be a problem .
Why did you do that ?
This is very easy .
Are they tall ?
I want to wait another week .
Has Tom gone ?
I hope no one saw you .
Here we are again .
Tom says you should always tell the truth .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
What did you eat for dinner last night ?
Did he go home yesterday ?
This is the very book that I wanted to read .
I &apos;m better than Tom .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have let Mary drive .
They lost their dog .
Do you want that ?
Let &apos;s get back to work .
What are you up to today ?
Tom is afraid of his father .
I want your opinion .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t here yet .
There &apos;s a problem I have to talk to you about .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Tom wasn &apos;t very good .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary told John .
He didn &apos;t know that .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got to go .
I &apos;m very happy here .
I know he did it .
Are you the new teacher ?
I &apos;m going to Boston with you .
I don &apos;t really know Tom very well .
Tom is always short of money .
Tom goes to bed early .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time right now to do that .
What about Tom ?
Tom often eats in bed .
Where &apos;s your money ?
Tom never talks about his family .
I &apos;m not sure yet .
Tom may be in Boston .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
That was enough .
Tom came across the street .
What would Tom say about this ?
That &apos;s not what Tom said .
I have a question for you .
Tom asked for my help .
They &apos;re not good .
It &apos;s only three o &apos;clock .
You &apos;ll have a rough time .
I told Tom what you did .
This question isn &apos;t easy .
When do you study ?
This is the book Tom gave me .
I &apos;m a little tired .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
I already said I &apos;m not going .
Tom , we have a problem .
When does he come ?
How did you do this ?
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
I need to buy one .
I think that I won &apos;t do that .
Please read that book .
Is that your sister ?
Tom was unable to walk .
I know what they &apos;re like .
You can &apos;t give Tom that .
I don &apos;t have money .
They are looking to you for help .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
They believe it .
I had to go there alone .
I have been here for two years .
You don &apos;t understand anything .
What did his wife say ?
Tom wishes to become a doctor .
Tom realized Mary was right .
No one lives in this house anymore .
Why does everything happen to me ?
I &apos;ll be there for you .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
I like the dog .
We &apos;re back .
I could not speak to him .
Are you tired ?
I don &apos;t have the time for this .
Let Tom finish .
Is Tom good at swimming ?
He is old .
Tom is the one with a car .
Tom is now staying in Boston .
Why is it here ?
Tom wanted to leave .
I &apos;m not a kid anymore .
Tom wanted to go with Mary .
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
I &apos;m not going to tell you where Tom is .
You &apos;re worrying too much .
More coffee , please .
I know Tom is a doctor .
Tom has really been very busy .
Where is your money ?
I don &apos;t need it .
We went to Boston .
Tom is at school now .
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
I &apos;m not that old .
Life &apos;s not easy .
Tom is looking at Mary .
I &apos;m no longer tired .
I must find it .
I go to school .
These are for Tom .
Tom ate alone .
They don &apos;t understand French .
When will we meet ?
Tom can &apos;t handle it .
Are you saying that you don &apos;t have enough money ?
We &apos;re doing what we want to do .
Why aren &apos;t they coming ?
We &apos;ve been through this before .
This won &apos;t be easy .
They found something .
That &apos;s what Tom thought .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
Can Tom help us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston .
I heard that Tom does that .
Do you want to do this ?
You and I aren &apos;t like that .
This boy is his brother .
Where &apos;s your school ?
I was with Tom last night .
You can say whatever you want .
You have to come .
I know you &apos;re happy about that .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
You have time .
I know Tom isn &apos;t alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
You should probably tell Tom how to do that .
Tom was absent from school yesterday .
Tom is always busy .
Tom has what we all want .
This is mine , and that &apos;s yours .
Can you help me a little ?
I won &apos;t say anything .
Nobody tried to help Tom .
He has much more money than I have .
I hope Tom comes .
I would like to meet him .
Did you forget ?
I &apos;ll be outside if you need me .
Tom saw her .
Tom may not be able to come .
I know who you are .
Do you have the money ?
I hope no one saw you .
Where are your children now ?
I love her sister very much .
Tom works here .
She wanted to understand .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I &apos;m coming .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
I want you to help Tom .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
Mary asked me if I loved her .
I can &apos;t tell you any more about it .
Here &apos;s something I want you to give to Tom .
Do you want to make me happy ?
I was worried about you all day .
I &apos;ll never forget that .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I &apos;d love to see you .
I will be gone by the time she comes back .
Do you want it or not ?
Tom wants it .
The book is on the table .
He should have done that long ago .
I think you understand me .
Tom came into my room .
Don &apos;t say too much .
I have to stay home today .
Do you have it ?
A lot still remains to be done .
This does not make me happy .
I went to school here .
What &apos;s going on out here ?
These are my books , and those are his books .
It &apos;s my job .
The question is who will do it .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
I think I &apos;ve seen enough .
I won &apos;t ask you anything else today .
Don &apos;t say anything .
I &apos;m going to give it to Tom .
You &apos;ll do no such thing .
What shall we do today ?
You &apos;re always welcome here .
Give Tom whatever it is he wants .
Tom is a very close friend .
I hope that you will like it .
What &apos;ll we tell the others ?
Tom likes his new job .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
When is school over ?
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
Tom knows what &apos;s wrong .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
What have you been doing this week ?
Tom can &apos;t buy what he wants to buy because he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He was alone in the house .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Nobody seems to know where Tom is .
We &apos;ll see you there .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t know what to do anymore .
No one is coming with me .
She just told me .
I &apos;m not very happy .
The problem is in that we don &apos;t have enough money .
I saw Tom three hours ago .
I &apos;ll wait for you .
Tom is the one who told me what to do .
Tom can &apos;t do that .
Tom wants to see Mary .
What don &apos;t you have ?
When will this be returned to me ?
We &apos;ve already lost three days .
It was really good .
Tom isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I think you should eat something .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
You need it .
Don &apos;t say such things .
It &apos;s not too late .
I must get back to work .
We saw Tom do it .
He knows how to make his wife happy .
What does that have to do with it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here .
He was very old .
I can &apos;t hear what they &apos;re saying .
No one is going to understand you .
He is far from happy .
Where were you three years ago ?
See you in Boston .
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
Tom won &apos;t like that answer .
Tom didn &apos;t tell the truth .
When I &apos;m with you , I &apos;m happy .
Is he a doctor ?
We &apos;re reading .
I don &apos;t think anyone can help me anymore .
This &apos;ll be fun .
Tom knows he isn &apos;t welcome here .
Did you buy anything to eat ?
Tom says he isn &apos;t happy .
I &apos;ve never had to do anything like this before .
How did you find Tom ?
I &apos;ll tell you .
It won &apos;t be easy .
I come from Australia .
I didn &apos;t want to be here in the first place .
Where did you see Tom ?
We &apos;re not all like that .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
I have to go do this .
I love my family .
You &apos;re like family .
Tom didn &apos;t have any children .
I wish Tom were more like you .
It couldn &apos;t be Tom .
Did he come by bus or by train ?
I don &apos;t want to have to do this .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom still lives here or not .
Sorry , I don &apos;t think I can do it .
Do you want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
I want to help you .
What have you been doing all this while ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I have a cat .
How do you like living on your own ?
What does your father do ?
He has been sick for a week .
Tom and Mary have found something .
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
I &apos;m almost done here .
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
She is out now .
Have you eaten yet ?
Tom looks busy .
Mary is still living at home with her parents .
You must eat .
We &apos;re not going out .
Do you know what she said ?
I want to want what you want .
Who says that ?
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
Tom wants that .
That &apos;s what they do .
Is Tom in on this ?
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Tom has been teaching for thirty years .
Has he come yet ?
That &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has very long to live .
Isn &apos;t that the truth ?
Nobody tells the truth anymore .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
Is that not enough ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like us ?
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
I should do that right away .
I gave Tom a book .
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Tom isn &apos;t working .
He &apos;s all right .
Children like playing outside .
Tom looks good , doesn &apos;t he ?
What does that say ?
I can &apos;t work for you .
Tom isn &apos;t really sure .
I just want you to know that I &apos;m here for you .
Why weren &apos;t you here yesterday ?
They &apos;re family .
I like it in Boston .
Tom got everything he wanted .
He has been in Japan for three years .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house almost every day after school .
I only need two of these .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
It &apos;s always been that way .
I used to be pretty good at this .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had .
I had fun doing that .
I think that this is the way to do it .
Where can one buy books ?
I &apos;ve forgotten his name .
I had nothing to do with her .
The work was all but finished .
How long have you lived here ?
Why aren &apos;t they here ?
I &apos;d like to see Tom .
Please give me this book .
I think this is yours .
They know who you are .
You don &apos;t have the time .
He is always on the go .
It doesn &apos;t make Tom happy .
I need an answer now .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
Do you want me to go home ?
I can &apos;t eat all this .
Here &apos;s the one I like .
Tom walked through the door .
I don &apos;t think Tom lives here .
Tom wanted to learn to read .
Why are you here , Tom ?
Tom can swim very fast .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll get it .
I like it .
Tom knows that .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
Tom is the one with the problem .
Why did you abandon me ?
Please , tell me .
He asked for more money .
I don &apos;t plan to meet Tom until tomorrow .
Tom listened to my opinion .
That isn &apos;t to my liking .
I want this one .
What is it like ?
They may come .
You know why I &apos;m here .
Tom can &apos;t swim and neither can Mary .
That is her house .
Tom and I are fine .
When did he go ?
Tom wants to go by train .
We saw this coming .
Now is the time .
He will soon become a father .
Tom was up all night .
Tom knows what &apos;s coming .
Let Tom do it .
You have my word on that .
I don &apos;t like this one .
Can I eat this ?
Tom , I want you to have this .
I did what I was told .
I found it .
You aren &apos;t welcome here .
We were right .
She boasts that she can swim well .
What do you want to ask me ?
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
Tom was late again this morning .
We don &apos;t know where he is .
How do you kids do it ?
Those are good .
If anybody can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
Why did you even bother to come ?
We were very happy .
Tom is here for you .
You ought to wait for Tom .
What &apos;s Tom doing there ?
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
Can you swim ?
My friends won &apos;t talk to me anymore .
Why is that good ?
The cat seems to want some water .
It &apos;s good to see you , too .
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
You &apos;re really tall , aren &apos;t you ?
I want to tell you something .
I don &apos;t know how to say it .
He doesn &apos;t know French at all .
What am I going to do ?
Who gave this to you ?
I &apos;d like a table by the window .
Do you have any more questions ?
Tom looks sick .
He saw the girl .
Tom wants to know how long we &apos;re going to be here .
Let go of me !
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
I told Tom not to worry .
I wish I had eaten more .
What happens tomorrow ?
The boy talks as if he were a man .
I have seen him many times .
It &apos;s easy .
We can &apos;t go back .
I don &apos;t know why we let you do that .
Do you have my book ?
What could he mean ?
I didn &apos;t like Boston at all .
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
That &apos;s the way it is .
Tom &apos;ll talk .
You said it yourself .
Don &apos;t you want to know where I was ?
It is up to you .
It was not so simple to write a letter in English .
I don &apos;t know where Tom lives .
Can he speak English ?
It was where Tom said it would be .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
What &apos;s going on out there ?
Tom came to me for help .
This is his car .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it here .
I ate way too much .
Tom isn &apos;t going to go with us .
Give it up , Tom .
Where &apos;s my room ?
Where were they ?
Tom did as I told him .
She does not do things like that .
I am afraid .
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
Can they see me ?
How many times has Tom done that this month ?
What is it you want to do ?
I will be with you right away .
We &apos;re from Boston .
Tom asked Mary not to text him again .
Tom can only get better .
This is my husband .
I should &apos;ve said that .
I hope to hear from you .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I was hardly able to see it .
I don &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
What time is it ?
I still don &apos;t know .
I should &apos;ve listened to my mother .
Is Tom a teacher ?
He took back everything he said .
May I help you ?
I &apos;ll come , too .
I may be able to help you .
I &apos;ll give Tom whatever he wants .
Tom said this to me .
I don &apos;t think Tom is coming .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I thought it was true .
She was afraid of the dog .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was there .
I didn &apos;t think Tom was in Boston .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom is dating Mary .
What &apos;ll Tom do with it ?
Tom told me everything .
It &apos;s time to go .
I know exactly what I have to do .
He lives in his car .
I should talk to Tom .
I was a teacher .
I don &apos;t know if we can help Tom this time .
I told Tom he wasn &apos;t welcome here .
I think that I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
I figured you should know .
Tom will do anything we want him to do .
Tom and Mary are friends of my family .
I like him .
My father was never around .
I can hardly believe it .
You did that in school , didn &apos;t you ?
We know who did it .
It &apos;s already late .
We know what happened next .
I should have studied more .
We were just friends .
The teacher cannot have said such a thing .
Is that what it takes ?
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be very happy together .
She says that she wants me to come with her .
I got tired of waiting for Tom .
Can we wait for Tom here ?
Having finished the work , Tom went home .
Tom and Mary just bought a new car .
Let &apos;s not ever do this again .
At first , I thought he was your brother .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ?
I think these are yours .
Tom is able to speak French .
We &apos;re going to wait in the car .
Where are the parents ?
We can get what we want without your help .
Is this the best you can do ?
What &apos;re you going to say ?
I think we both know why I &apos;m here .
How long are you in town , Tom ?
I have a little money .
Tom can &apos;t have gone to bed yet .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
You still have a lot to learn .
I think Tom already knows .
You need not have come so early .
I need to put the children to bed .
You said it yourself .
I think Tom is going to like it here .
What if Tom was right ?
You don &apos;t have to stay .
She is a friend of mine .
I have to go to the police station .
We should do this every day .
She can &apos;t live without him .
I know why Tom is doing that .
I want to hear what you have to say .
What school did you go to ?
Do you have two books ?
You are tired , and so am I .
You must do it .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s you .
What are you sorry about ?
My father is busy just now .
You may go .
She is old enough to know better .
We have to stop it .
Tom speaks French better than Mary .
Tom and Mary are often together .
Why was Tom in Boston ?
Tom has left the city .
There are a lot of people here .
We know what we want .
Were both Tom and Mary born in Australia ?
Don &apos;t keep saying you &apos;re sorry .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he was hearing .
I don &apos;t want to see that .
Tom was never happy .
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
I am in the house .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
They didn &apos;t have enough money .
They know who you are .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the answer yet .
Tom and Mary are my children .
What do you want me to do with this ?
I know what I did .
How old is your cat ?
When did you buy it ?
This is for Tom .
I only think of you .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
What can I do for you ?
He has this large room to himself .
Tom came to see you yesterday .
Tom must have seen me .
Where did you buy that ?
I will prosper .
It is fun to speak in English .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything today .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as his brother .
When will you come ?
I &apos;ll be there .
She requested help , but no one came .
That boy looks like Tom .
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
What &apos;s happening here ?
Tom left after me .
Give me my money .
I will be back soon .
Tom didn &apos;t stop talking .
I have money for you .
I really want to be a good teacher .
I haven &apos;t eaten yet .
Here they come .
That &apos;s what I told her .
No one &apos;s in there .
Tom is still sick in bed .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
I &apos;d like to go .
This has nothing to do with you .
Tom has big eyes .
I have to have that .
We don &apos;t have long .
I wanted more .
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
We don &apos;t have school tomorrow .
I &apos;m here for you , Tom .
I wasn &apos;t there .
Tom doesn &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
You &apos;re not a doctor .
You don &apos;t want to know .
I know it myself .
It &apos;s all I have .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
We all make mistakes , don &apos;t we ?
I wish it had never happened .
You have to believe me .
Maybe it &apos;s true .
I &apos;m really old .
He made us do the work .
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
I don &apos;t know much about Australia .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to do that .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
He has no wife , no children and no friends .
It was a different time .
How many times have you done this ?
You were pretending , weren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m here , aren &apos;t I ?
Give me some water , please .
That wasn &apos;t what I wanted to hear .
You should do that right away .
Tom comes from Boston .
Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight .
I want someone to tell me why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
No one was at home .
We understand this .
Tom has told me I need to do that .
What &apos;s she doing ?
I don &apos;t have anything to give you .
Don &apos;t you want to be here ?
We &apos;ll go with you .
We don &apos;t study French .
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school .
I had better ask her .
No one could buy anything .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I will make her happy .
Tom is a good friend .
I will go at 10 .
We &apos;re sorry , too .
I &apos;ll stay .
This is not enough .
Tom will always be here for you .
That house is mine .
Tom is a fast talker .
I got it .
People are talking .
Tom wanted to be there .
You said so yourself .
He &apos;s not my boyfriend .
We almost never eat out .
If possible , I &apos;d like to see him .
I don &apos;t like either of them .
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
He left ten minutes ago .
That &apos;s what makes me happy .
Tom isn &apos;t as old as I am .
That &apos;s mine .
I should like to go for a swim .
I &apos;m not as tall as he is .
Where &apos;s Tom going with Mary ?
I said there &apos;s no one here .
Tom likes you very much .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
Is this your car ?
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
I won &apos;t help you .
How old is Tom now ?
I &apos;ve eaten a great deal of food this week .
She really needs your help .
What did Tom do yesterday ?
Is this Tom &apos;s car ?
I can &apos;t see Tom .
That &apos;s what you want to do , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
I wish that you hadn &apos;t told me that .
Can anyone tell me the time ?
Where have you been ?
We &apos;re nearly out of time .
I want a dog .
I met your father yesterday .
You don &apos;t have to go , do you ?
It &apos;s just one of those things .
He can read well .
Nobody could decide as to what to do .
Are you absolutely sure ?
Tom must do it now .
Tom told me that he doesn &apos;t have a problem with that .
He looks much better now .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m agreeing with you .
Do you want this or don &apos;t you ?
What do I have to do ?
Tom looks tired this evening .
What if I &apos;m right ?
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Why don &apos;t I go ?
I &apos;ll never be as good as Tom .
I &apos;ve got the money .
You are children .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
This is your problem .
This is Tom &apos;s cat .
We &apos;ll never forget that .
How long are you planning to stay ?
Can I say something now ?
Tom went back outside .
We don &apos;t do that .
You know where I &apos;ll be .
He had to stay in bed .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy here .
I know Tom is happy .
Where did you see her ?
Tom won &apos;t even look at me .
The station was deserted .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s already time to go home .
You can &apos;t just pretend that nothing happened .
Tom can &apos;t be sick .
He is not there .
I was very busy .
Tom is as tall as me .
No one will believe me .
Tom will remain at home .
What do you want to watch ?
You &apos;re going to be a father .
They &apos;ll understand us .
Did you see your friends last week ?
Ask Tom if you don &apos;t believe me .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
Here comes the bus !
We have work to do .
Let &apos;s ask him .
Who lives in this house ?
I know about that .
When did you go to work ?
Tom is going to love being here .
Why me ?
They say that he &apos;s still alive .
Tom wanted to write something .
That has always been so .
You know Tom likes Boston .
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
When does it arrive ?
She left the room .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
You may go .
Why are you so busy today ?
I didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that .
Tom was busy all day .
What we need is a little more time .
Tom lives with us .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
You &apos;re not supposed to be here .
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
How tall are you ?
Thank Tom for me .
Don &apos;t boast too much about that .
Have Tom do that .
I &apos;ve got to leave soon .
What did you make ?
How is it going ?
I can come .
Tom said that Mary likes you .
Tom told Mary the truth .
We &apos;re working .
They don &apos;t need to do it right away .
We &apos;re not giving up .
What did you do yesterday ?
This is going to be easy .
He can hardly speak .
I &apos;ll be back later today .
Tom knows what &apos;s really going on .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants you to do .
All is well with me .
They know how to swim .
Tom does that .
I &apos;m not feeling too great .
I can &apos;t tell Tom that .
You &apos;re not too old to do that .
I did nothing all day .
I think Tom is out .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better .
I think Tom will be able to help .
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn &apos;t ready yet .
I need to know how this happened .
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
I don &apos;t want to eat any more .
Why do you ask that ?
I &apos;ve known you for years .
We are who we are .
Does he have many books ?
Tom walked in the room .
He seems to be ill .
Can you help me , please ?
What are you going to have ?
Can you put the children to bed ?
The doctor gave it to her .
We will discuss this problem later .
I don &apos;t know what I want .
I &apos;ll be back in five minutes .
You know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
Why did Tom give you that ?
How do we get back home from here ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he needs .
I just want to have fun .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
You can talk here .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
Give that to him .
Tom was with a girl , but I didn &apos;t manage to see who it was .
Tom was late again this morning .
Leave us alone , please .
You &apos;d better go back home now .
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle ?
I don &apos;t know why I said that .
You &apos;d better stay in bed for a few days .
We should study .
I just wanted to say that I love you .
Do you know who he is ?
This is not quite enough .
Tom has made a lot of new friends .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
I have a couple questions .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
Tom may want to do that .
Why do I need to be in Boston ?
What doesn &apos;t Tom know ?
I met him yesterday .
I can &apos;t find Tom .
I want these .
I don &apos;t need a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Have you already eaten ?
I &apos;m finished .
We instantly became friends .
He &apos;s not always happy .
I know Tom &apos;s father .
That &apos;s not what we want .
Tom isn &apos;t scared .
Tom never saw her again .
Tom is absent .
I loved that .
This is my book .
He was absent from school yesterday .
Tom is as tall as you .
Tom said he thought that Mary was in Boston .
I may be able to help you .
I have three friends who can speak French .
The problem here isn &apos;t me .
Do you have time to help me ?
He &apos;s fast .
That &apos;s not how Tom sees it .
I have faith in you .
I want to talk to you about Tom .
I have to see you .
Tom need not have worried .
I don &apos;t want Tom here .
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years .
He didn &apos;t get in until 2 o &apos;clock in the morning .
I don &apos;t know you .
That house belongs to me .
I will not go to school tomorrow .
I love you more than anyone else .
Tom won &apos;t come .
I want you , Tom .
I think you &apos;d like that .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom .
I can &apos;t believe Tom is gone .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
Tom says Mary is happy .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe us .
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
Are you in Australia ?
He knows how to drive a car .
What Tom really wanted was a good friend he could talk to .
Tom seems to know exactly what he &apos;s doing .
I &apos;d like to see what &apos;s going on .
I can &apos;t talk about that right now .
I don &apos;t think I want to talk about it .
I want to hear it from you .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
This is all the money I have .
Tom didn &apos;t come .
I &apos;m sorry it worked out this way .
Her friends look up to her .
What are they doing out there ?
She pretended that she was sick .
I will give it to you .
I believe it &apos;s finished .
I have never felt better .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
I have seen her before .
You are exactly like your mother .
Give me your hand .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
I knew what had happened .
Tom kept me waiting for three hours .
I would like to talk with you again .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
I won &apos;t be able to help you .
I know that you &apos;re a teacher .
Both my parents are at home now .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
It &apos;s for us .
Who would buy this ?
He really needs your help .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
He has made me what I am .
I saw Tom in there .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
It &apos;s time we went home .
I &apos;ll be back late .
Tom wanted to be a doctor .
I must help him .
What &apos;ll Tom be doing in Boston ?
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
We know all about you .
Tom is with her .
I made Tom happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a dad .
That &apos;s a book .
Is one of you Tom ?
I don &apos;t want to get sick .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
Tom is not going to do it .
I &apos;m a little tired .
Tom gave me that .
There &apos;s still plenty that needs to be done .
Tom doesn &apos;t like school .
How long have you been in Boston ?
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that .
What did Tom get ?
Tom knows where you are .
Tom isn &apos;t the problem .
We &apos;re here for the day .
Tom is quite handsome .
Tom hardly speaks any French .
I just want this to never happen again .
Tom and Mary are doing that .
You don &apos;t have to help .
I like having plenty to do .
I thought he was sick .
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
I think Tom used to date Mary .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary is .
Tom was there for three hours .
I don &apos;t need any help .
Tom says things are going well .
My father has many books .
Don &apos;t say that word .
He works all night .
I was unable to go outside .
I want you .
I know your type .
Why do you want Tom to do that ?
It &apos;ll take you too long .
I want to stay here with you .
He lives in Boston .
I didn &apos;t arrive until it was too late .
Tom says he wants to go to Boston .
I can &apos;t leave my family .
I know it &apos;s Tom .
Do you want to hang out at my place ?
You &apos;ll never guess what Tom did .
It &apos;s what I like .
We &apos;re leaving now .
We live here .
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what that is .
You &apos;re not my friend anymore .
This is my other sister .
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
I have nothing to write .
What should Tom have done ?
You made an error .
It is almost three .
Where do you want it ?
What are we doing ?
Tom and Mary are my friends .
They &apos;ve lost so much .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did that .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
I have to deal with this alone .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
Please give me some more coffee .
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
We are going to meet him tonight .
Did Tom say that ?
Do you know that ?
Speaking English is very difficult for me .
Where does he work now ?
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him .
He wanted to meet me .
Have they gone ?
I heard you talking to Tom .
Tom was in the room .
She went with him .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
Give me what you have in your hand .
Tom needs help .
Tom may do whatever he likes .
That boy looks like Tom .
He wants to talk to you .
Tom is not the problem .
Can I go to bed now ?
Tom plans to be there .
Tom is your son , not mine .
Tom made that himself .
We have to study .
What a night !
You can wait in this room .
Tom lives with his parents .
This is my school .
Who wrote the book ?
How about going swimming ?
I pretended to work .
We know what to do .
I knew it was too late .
I could hardly understand him .
I can &apos;t tell you how sorry I am .
Why is Tom good at French ?
I know very little about him .
Mary was like a sister to me .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
I think Tom said that .
We no longer need you .
Do you have many friends ?
I saw her again .
Did Tom really say that ?
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
It &apos;s easy .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
Tom left the book on the table .
Tom was listening .
Tom needs to get ready for school .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go .
Let &apos;s see if Tom knows more than we do .
Tom and Mary know about it .
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
I need some time .
Tom won &apos;t let me drive anymore .
I want to do that .
We &apos;re not doing that .
Tom is working .
She must be very happy .
I &apos;m not quite sure yet .
Nobody needs me .
What can you tell me about that ?
We have to help Tom .
Don &apos;t you know what happened yesterday ?
I gave you a book .
Tom won &apos;t like this .
I want to speak French .
Please give me something to eat .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
Tom is working with us .
This is where my father works .
I can &apos;t see him either .
This question is not easy .
I &apos;d like not to do it .
I have a dog and a cat .
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
Did you do it ?
Tom knows something that he &apos;s not telling us .
I cannot tell how this is done .
Tom told me what you did .
Tom really needs your help .
Tom seems lost .
Tom wanted to buy that book and give it to Mary .
My parents don &apos;t know .
I would do it if I could .
We don &apos;t make mistakes .
We &apos;re not going to wait for Tom .
Is it white ?
I wish I could speak French as well as you do .
Perhaps you &apos;d better drive .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
Say it in English .
I don &apos;t go out much .
What can you tell me about it ?
Where is that ?
I want to know who did this .
I know exactly where Tom is .
I &apos;ll give you what you want .
Tom didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Tom can &apos;t walk .
I heard Tom is sick .
It happened in a flash .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
Can I be excused ?
They &apos;re going .
I &apos;m sorry that you can &apos;t come this evening .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s mother ?
This is my brother .
I &apos;ll write you a letter .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want you here ?
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
This is one of mine .
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine .
Is she your mom ?
How old are the kids ?
Can you tell me why we need to do this ?
It &apos;s under the table .
We are leaving Japan tomorrow morning .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom walked off .
Please keep on working even when I &apos;m not here .
They were sick .
What if Tom is right ?
Aren &apos;t you going to bed ?
Tom always talks fast .
I know nothing about it .
How come he didn &apos;t show up ?
I can &apos;t leave Tom .
I just saw Tom .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you .
I do not like both of them .
I will give him the book tomorrow .
We can &apos;t help you .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do so .
Tom has one , too .
Do you know where Tom is now ?
I &apos;m not going to be afraid anymore .
I love my friends .
I am fine .
I think about Tom all day .
Tom never seems to have much to say .
You &apos;re too big .
I can &apos;t believe Tom said that .
Tom isn &apos;t going to Boston .
Have you been in Boston long ?
Tom was the last to leave .
I know what you did in Australia .
Is that Tom &apos;s car ?
I went to bed early .
We need your help .
Where did you see them ?
You &apos;ve found it .
We &apos;re working on that .
She just left .
Tom is doing very well .
That &apos;s the way the cookie crumbles .
Is that really true ?
You know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well , don &apos;t you ?
We &apos;ve been here almost three hours .
I am right .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
I still don &apos;t believe it !
That &apos;s not what I think .
I just want to be alone .
I gave Tom one of those .
Why are people scared of Tom ?
Tom hasn &apos;t come yet .
This is my bicycle .
He asked me for money .
They aren &apos;t happy to see you .
The answer was easy .
She is always scared .
I want to know why .
Father let me drive his car .
I was in Boston last week .
Tom told me to speak to you in French .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got much time .
You really don &apos;t know who that is , do you ?
That &apos;s not how .
Give me your book .
It &apos;s hard to say .
They understand now .
Tom will take it .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
Stand back , please .
Why is it there ?
What do you want to do with this ?
I didn &apos;t see you .
I don &apos;t know if it is true .
I &apos;ll be free this evening .
Tom came to my house yesterday .
Tom is out there .
Tom took his time .
It scares me .
I know where we are .
I &apos;ll stay at home today .
I stopped working for Tom three years ago .
Tom went back to Boston yesterday .
I &apos;m going with Tom to Boston .
I &apos;ll stay with you until Tom gets here .
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
I think this book is very good .
I am busy .
Family is family .
He relented .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
We were all a little tired .
Tom left the house .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
Have you seen my sister ?
That doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at home .
I only wish it were that simple .
How can you eat so much ?
She had only a small sum of money .
Do you know what Tom said ?
You &apos;re old enough now .
I &apos;ve never heard such a thing .
Tom said that he &apos;d come .
When are you coming to Boston ?
What did Tom want ?
What is it you want , Tom ?
Those who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t need to go .
What &apos;s worrying you ?
I &apos;ll take one .
We want to be here for Tom .
Why are the police here ?
Something &apos;s got to be done .
That &apos;s what Tom said this morning .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
I don &apos;t want to tell my girlfriend that .
Is that a cat ?
That won &apos;t be hard to do .
He &apos;ll be along in ten minutes .
He had no friend to help him .
I told Tom that I was busy .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
I need to go eat something .
Tom bought a table .
I was just looking out the window .
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
Tom and his wife co-authored a book about Boston .
I want to see more .
Leave it where you found it .
She is nothing but a child .
What did Tom just say to you ?
I don &apos;t want you to go to Boston .
Tom told me what he wanted .
I wasn &apos;t kidding .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
We &apos;re going to go .
Tom couldn &apos;t help .
How long will you have to wait ?
She can hardly speak .
Tom really doesn &apos;t need the money .
How exactly can I help you ?
I like it very much .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
Anybody home ?
I don &apos;t think I have much longer to live .
Stop saying that .
I asked Tom how his job was going .
That &apos;s exactly what I mean .
We have lots to do .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t stay long .
Are you saying you don &apos;t want to go ?
When are you busy ?
Things don &apos;t always happen the way we intend .
There &apos;s nothing here .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
Are you from Boston ?
I made these for you .
Tom can &apos;t see you .
We are coming .
Tom has located Mary .
Are you ten years old ?
I made these .
You do what you have to do .
Why is Tom doing that ?
I know there &apos;s a room available .
I love him .
I already saw this .
Tom might have to study French .
I would like to see it .
Tom &apos;s free .
It &apos;s about time .
I want you to know that .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet , have they ?
Tom and Mary had three children .
They &apos;re with me .
Tom &apos;s left .
Tom can &apos;t speak French .
I think that you &apos;re right .
Tom was there for me .
I really can &apos;t understand it .
Let me know .
That boy looks like you .
I think Tom looks really good .
Is it really you ?
Thank you for seeing us .
Tom was also on the bus .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
We must help Tom .
Tom came home .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
What am I going to do with you ?
They &apos;ll find you .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I &apos;m not happy .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
I should &apos;ve stayed home .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
I have met her before .
Tom wants to talk to you .
What do you want me to do with Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
Who goes there ?
We have a few questions for you .
Tom wants to see that .
I can &apos;t tell you their names .
Tom is a good friend of mine .
Tom wants to see you and me .
Where shall we eat tonight ?
What does the cat want ?
We can talk about this later .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
Tom is no longer alive .
Mary is a good mother .
No one came .
I &apos;d be happy here , I think .
I &apos;m so sorry .
He gave them a lift to the town .
I &apos;m a man .
We &apos;re just friends .
I &apos;ve often been there .
Tom is looking good .
Tom ran out of money .
I still want to talk to you .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;m going to swim every day .
I came back home late .
I &apos;m not going to be there .
I &apos;ve still got things to do .
Tom isn &apos;t going .
I can &apos;t hear it .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
I was at work .
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
Do you know how to do this ?
Tom is playing with Mary &apos;s cat .
If anyone can do it , Tom can .
I have a question for you .
A car &apos;s coming .
This is always the way it has been .
Tom likes it .
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
It &apos;s more fun than studying .
Let &apos;s not forget about what Tom said .
What &apos;s with Tom ?
You need us .
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
Are you sure you &apos;re well enough to go to school ?
This isn &apos;t fun .
You look very good .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
Where can we meet you ?
Aren &apos;t you going to ask ?
I can &apos;t live in this house anymore .
I want a book .
Time is money .
May I help you ?
You did it again .
Tom said it was a problem .
I think that I &apos;ll do that .
Tom said something to Mary .
Tom , where are we ?
It &apos;s a problem .
He might not be happy .
No one ever tells me anything around here .
She knows . She always knows .
I need Tom &apos;s money .
Tom can &apos;t find Mary .
I will make a man out of you .
I guess they really weren &apos;t busy .
Do you really want to go to Boston with me ?
Tom knows nothing .
We need to talk .
We &apos;re all done .
I can &apos;t believe you came here alone .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
Can I go ?
You don &apos;t need to go if you don &apos;t want to .
I can &apos;t let Tom go alone .
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Why is Tom home ?
I &apos;d like to work in Australia .
All are present .
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
They already know .
He couldn &apos;t find the house .
They &apos;re happy .
I have no friends .
Let him do it .
Is your father a doctor ?
Tom didn &apos;t have much money .
Speaking English isn &apos;t easy .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t coming .
She doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
You work hard .
Let &apos;s talk .
He has money , but he &apos;s not happy .
I like your car .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
I don &apos;t remember where I bought it .
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear Mary .
What do you and Tom want to do ?
Tom has a lot of things to do .
I think I &apos;ll take that one .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
What has that to do with me ?
We have lost sight of him .
They will come .
I got plenty of help .
Who wants to know ?
Tom is handsome .
How do you know what you should do ?
What &apos;s your problem ?
I don &apos;t like that name .
I &apos;ve never done this before .
Tom is happy .
He did as I told him .
I wanted to speak in French with Tom .
I &apos;ve got a wife and three children .
How &apos;s Tom going to find Mary ?
I like to write in French .
It was like that when I got it .
We met that night .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s parents .
My mother can &apos;t drive a car .
I &apos;ll join you later .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
Tom and I are doing OK .
How come you didn &apos;t come ?
Is his father a doctor ?
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too well .
I knew I forgot something .
Tom always had a lot of money .
I &apos;d like to know if that &apos;s true .
I did nothing .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
We &apos;re not like that .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
You can read French , can &apos;t you ?
Tom saw me give Mary some money .
He always looked happy , but never was .
I could help Tom .
Why does Tom want this ?
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t speak to you .
She &apos;s rather good .
May I have one of these ?
If you want , you can go .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
Tom and Mary were often seen together .
I know where they are .
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
In a few years , we &apos;ll all be doing that .
I can &apos;t tell you what I think .
I hope you know what this is .
That is her car .
I &apos;ve got to speak to you .
Have you seen my watch ?
I can get it from Tom .
I don &apos;t want it .
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
Tom wrote that book .
Tom isn &apos;t there .
That room is not very large .
What &apos;ll you give Tom ?
I want to live in Boston .
Tom wouldn &apos;t speak to Mary .
I come from Boston .
I don &apos;t know her .
They &apos;re about to go .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
I &apos;d leave .
What shall I do with it ?
We &apos;re sorry , but we can &apos;t do anything more for you .
Tom is going to do this .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
We need you .
This book is easy enough for them to read .
How many people are there in this room ?
Tom barely speaks to us anymore .
We &apos;ll be home all day tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem happy .
When did you buy it ?
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
I don &apos;t like kids .
Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
Thank you for doing this , Tom .
We can do it right now .
This one &apos;s on me .
I love living in Boston .
I am going , too .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard that word in a long time .
He has been sick for a long time .
I love kids .
Can you see anything out there ?
She has a lot of money .
Where would I find books ?
Everyone does it .
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
You &apos;re not going to do that , are you ?
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
What is going on here ?
I &apos;ll never do it again .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do that again .
Why do you want to learn French ?
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston .
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week .
It &apos;s good seeing you .
We all want Tom to be happy .
What do you want here ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
What time did they leave ?
All you have to do is tell Tom to leave .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
I want to ask you about Tom .
There are people here who need your help .
I &apos;m not going out .
I want to do everything I &apos;m supposed to do .
I haven &apos;t eaten in three days .
Tom had a good opinion of Mary .
It was from Tom .
I hope that she will help me .
I hardly ever get sick .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
I cannot help you .
I can &apos;t talk about this now .
This is not about money .
These are for you .
You may do whatever you want .
You can go home if you like .
He has no friends to fall back on .
Maybe he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
I know why Tom wants to do that .
He &apos;s her friend .
I &apos;ll give you something .
I don &apos;t want that .
I think I know that girl over there .
Tom wants this .
Why didn &apos;t you do that ?
You should stay in school .
You are telling it second hand , aren &apos;t you ?
I have almost no money now .
Tom is already really good .
Where did you buy that ?
Tom knows what it is .
She kept him waiting for a long time .
This is one of mine .
We still have a lot of time .
Where do you want me ?
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
I need you to leave now .
Tom has been avoiding Mary all day .
Tom must &apos;ve left .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Are you sure Tom is here ?
Tom did this .
Tom and I have to leave .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
Tom is gone .
I don &apos;t know how to say what I want to say in French .
It &apos;s none of your business .
He gave it to me .
I forgot something in my car .
Tom knows what it takes .
I haven &apos;t told him anything .
May I ask you something ?
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t have come .
I was very busy this week .
He can barely read .
Tom saw you .
I love your son .
There are many books in my room .
I knew who did it .
I &apos;m not very happy here .
Tom knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
He lives with his mom .
Where does Tom live now ?
She is a good English speaker .
I want to be here for you .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Tom didn &apos;t admit his mistake .
I can &apos;t wait all day .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
He had few other friends .
Is this your bicycle ?
You should learn French .
Tom is going to go home .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
Tom likes Mary , but Mary likes John .
My husband is a doctor .
She speaks relatively fast .
She may not come .
You must help us .
She &apos;s my sister .
Isn &apos;t Tom handsome ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be here .
I need time .
I have to go . It &apos;s getting late .
I saw you .
I know nothing about her .
I hope you know that , Tom .
I &apos;d better get back to work .
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear me .
Let Tom eat whatever he wants .
You aren &apos;t going to tell my parents , are you ?
He no longer works here .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I think you should pick Tom .
He still has much to learn .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
She never told me .
I &apos;d like to go to Boston .
Tom wants to learn how to ride a bike .
I &apos;m one of you .
What are you doing today ?
I know who you are .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
I never wanted to do this .
No one has come .
You never stop , do you ?
I really am very busy .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;d like to see what Tom has .
I &apos;ve been a teacher for two years .
I hope that Tom will never do that again .
I &apos;d do it again .
Tom rarely goes out .
Tom could hardly hear what Mary was saying .
How long does it take to get to the station ?
How have you been keeping ?
Tom will help us .
That &apos;s what we want .
You never say anything .
I think both of them are right .
I won &apos;t forget this .
I know you want to be happy .
What does Tom have to do ?
I want to go to Australia .
I &apos;m not sure I want to see this .
Tom seems to be tired .
Have you heard this story already ?
Is that all Tom told you ?
That happens sometimes .
The dog seems to have been sick .
What shall we eat tonight ?
I &apos;m not scared at all .
I thought you were right .
Tom came home very late last night .
Tom won &apos;t be away for long .
It &apos;s there now .
Let &apos;s take the bus .
You have to do that .
She has three children .
He &apos;s your father .
You &apos;re not safe here .
Tom came just as I was leaving .
That may not happen .
I guess that &apos;s all I need .
He does not like us .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
You &apos;re not happy , are you ?
I &apos;m a good teacher .
I haven &apos;t met him .
Tom came by himself .
There it is .
I &apos;m now busy writing a book .
What are you up to today ?
Why do I have to do it ?
I don &apos;t know what we will do .
Let &apos;s play house .
Tom came to see you .
I &apos;ve got a lot of things to do this week .
Tom didn &apos;t even shake my hand .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I wanted to be with you .
Tom has money .
I know how it is .
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
Tom wanted to live in Boston .
What &apos;s that thing you have in your hand ?
Tom is out of work .
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
What are your plans for today ?
Where did this happen ?
That &apos;s all I have .
I took the bus back .
I &apos;m not my father .
Tom and I get along fairly well .
Don &apos;t ask me what that is .
Tom knows not to do that .
Tom has got it .
Can I count on you to do that ?
Have you finished yet ?
They have to go to school .
Is your mother here ?
I saw the doctor .
Tom looks good .
It sounds like you want to be alone .
I think we &apos;re going to be fine .
I &apos;m not sure .
We can &apos;t help you .
Tom just listened .
I did that right away .
Tom lost his friends .
I have everything I need .
Tom has many friends in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his family .
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
I think Tom likes me .
I &apos;ve got kids .
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
That &apos;s hard to say .
No one &apos;s seen Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you here .
Tom is almost as tall as me .
There is no one there .
I &apos;m coming with you .
I think you might be right .
What did you do ?
I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
Do you want me to help you or not ?
You &apos;re a good boy .
Why did you buy it ?
It looks like Tom is having fun .
I &apos;m so tired !
They didn &apos;t do anything .
Nobody is really sure .
It &apos;s just a cat .
I know what Tom is like .
Tom was very good .
I forget his name .
Tom isn &apos;t as fast as me .
We aren &apos;t children .
Tom has gone home .
Tom could easily have done that .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
We all speak French .
All &apos;s well that ends well .
Do you have time ?
Tom and Mary became good friends .
If you want me to help you , all you have to do is ask .
Give those to Tom .
Let &apos;s go to eat together .
We &apos;ll arrive in three hours if we drive .
What are you going to get ?
Tom has written three books .
Where are you , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom said he enjoyed it .
We are doomed .
We &apos;ll see what Tom has to say .
What do we have to do ?
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Do you want in on this ?
Is this Tom &apos;s bike ?
We can do better than that .
Tom is her brother .
Tom looked at the clock .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
Did you say something ?
All I can say is that I &apos;d rather not go .
Who came ?
How does he go to school ?
Tom comes to school by car .
You should meet Tom .
We &apos;ll do it together .
We don &apos;t need your money .
Who gave that to you ?
I have to give it to Tom .
Tom will meet you there .
I &apos;m not certain what to do .
I don &apos;t think I want that .
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
Tom has this large room to himself .
Can you help ?
Get Tom some food .
What do you think I should &apos;ve done ?
Does Tom have one ?
He looks very tired .
That &apos;s not my concern .
They can understand me .
I don &apos;t know what to do with it .
That &apos;s about it .
What &apos;s Tom going to say about this ?
I guess I should &apos;ve known .
I &apos;ll give you whatever you want .
I don &apos;t like the house he lives in .
I came here to tell you something .
Whether or not he will come is doubtful .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
How did Tom find you ?
Tom &apos;s afraid .
Tom left before I arrived .
They &apos;re going to do it .
I &apos;d like to help you .
You have to do this now .
I &apos;m hardly ever home .
I have nothing to say on this matter .
I &apos;ll give it to you tomorrow .
I have nothing to say to you .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t doing something he isn &apos;t supposed to be doing .
I need money .
Tom isn &apos;t coming till tomorrow .
I &apos;m a friend of Tom and Mary &apos;s .
He needs money .
It doesn &apos;t make much difference .
Tom was looking at you .
I thought Mary loved me .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
I know why you want it .
Who &apos;s she ?
I had to work .
You didn &apos;t tell Tom anything , did you ?
I didn &apos;t eat anything .
We need to talk about this .
Tom has a lot of things he has to do .
I saw Tom doing it .
Did Tom enjoy it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
I do want it .
She is good at speaking English .
You &apos;re one of us now .
She can drive a car .
Tell Tom why you &apos;re here .
I can &apos;t help loving Tom .
Tom is not as old as you .
How did you get into the house ?
Tom had a son .
I &apos;m in the house .
We &apos;ll do great .
I was able to find the street , but I couldn &apos;t find her house .
That was quick .
How would you like your coffee ?
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
Tom &apos;s doing OK .
Tom and Mary both want to go .
Tom didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
I must go now .
What &apos;re we doing in here ?
Tom is scared of Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
Where is my clock ?
Tom looked into the room .
Tom didn &apos;t know about it .
That &apos;s what we want to know .
How are you doing , Tom ?
Tom can do just about anything .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom .
This is not to his liking .
Are you sure you &apos;re not tired ?
Don &apos;t put it that way .
You &apos;re right , as always .
He is busy writing a letter .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t done that .
How long have you been waiting ?
Do you have a girlfriend ?
He came by bus .
The train was about to leave the station .
Everyone &apos;s tired .
Ask again later .
Who wrote this book ?
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
The question is whether he &apos;ll read the letter or not .
Here &apos;s your money .
We can help you .
That car is mine .
If Tom is right , Mary is in Boston now .
I want to be more like Tom .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time .
There is no one in the house .
Why are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
What did they do ?
I like this job .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
He asked us to help him .
What was he doing here ?
What did they find ?
Can we just go home ?
What are you guys doing here ?
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
They &apos;ll find him .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
Tom isn &apos;t like us .
We know where your family lives .
I hope we find Tom .
It &apos;s quite large .
I thought Tom was at school .
We &apos;ll meet Tom there .
We should help Tom .
Nobody does that .
When did you buy it ?
What do you want to do with it ?
Where are you now ?
I want to hear you say it .
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money to buy a house .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
This book isn &apos;t mine .
You can &apos;t do anything right now .
I &apos;ve heard everything .
What do you want to hear from me ?
You have to go whether you like it or not .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
She always speaks English .
He came back two days later .
You are what you eat .
Tom is the father .
I can &apos;t really believe that .
Can you do that again ?
You &apos;ll do it .
The dog will not harm you .
I hope that Tom will come .
Where were you ?
Whatever happens happens .
I don &apos;t have any brothers .
You &apos;re not like me .
I &apos;m not sleepy .
We &apos;re not going to do that again .
I &apos;ve had enough to eat .
I tried to help her .
Can I get a lift back to the city with you ?
Does Tom have one ?
Did you do that ?
I &apos;ll work on that .
There are still people who are unable to read .
Can your wife speak French ?
Do you remember who I am ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do next .
I want to know how you did it .
This is good for us .
How do we find it ?
That &apos;s just what Tom needs .
Tom is too good for you .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
He won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
He lost everything .
Isn &apos;t that good enough ?
They &apos;re in Boston .
Has Tom ever written a letter in French ?
Tom seems to be busier than Mary .
He looked very tired .
My father is tall .
Tom is my sister &apos;s boy .
The boy bought a dog .
This is a fun activity for the whole family .
I &apos;m going to go .
Why are you still here ?
You &apos;ll do what you have to do .
What are those ?
Tom has gone for the day .
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
Money is not everything .
When did you buy this car ?
How did you like it ?
Tom said something in French .
What &apos;s this got to do with Tom ?
You can stay here as long as you want .
How about tomorrow ?
I know what Tom is doing here .
Where will we meet ?
You won &apos;t give that to Tom , will you ?
Did Tom come home ?
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what to say .
No one is there .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
I actually did that yesterday .
I hear that he &apos;s still alive .
Tom wanted to say more , but he couldn &apos;t .
I suppose you want to eat now .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
Did you say you had a cat ?
Do you know what &apos;s going on there ?
It &apos;s late .
Tom has a brother in Boston .
These are my friends .
How did you come by all this money ?
He &apos;s never been better .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I had to stay at home .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary .
You must go at once .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
They don &apos;t know that .
I really need it .
I think you know what I mean .
I want to be happy , too .
Tom plans to go to Boston by himself .
What &apos;re we going to do ?
Do you have it with you ?
I just don &apos;t know what to do .
He seems to know nothing about the matter .
I &apos;m as old as Tom .
They make a great team .
We &apos;re going .
I saw you there .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Tom has very little money .
Tom can ride a bicycle .
That won &apos;t help you .
Tom may be here .
Tom was like a father to Mary .
Where can we meet ?
I never should &apos;ve listened to you .
Why didn &apos;t Tom say anything ?
Give me five days .
Tom knows who we are .
I bought it yesterday .
We need to know what &apos;s going on .
Let &apos;s talk about your job .
You know who they are .
Where does Tom go to school ?
I have to go back to work .
She seems to have been ill .
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat .
We need help .
All you have to do is to meet her there .
I hope you and Tom will like it here .
He &apos;s not my father .
You may be correct .
I only just met Tom .
He has never been late for school .
It &apos;s time for the kids to go to bed .
Why do you have to do it ?
Can &apos;t we talk about this later ?
Tom and Mary want to learn French .
I just met her on the street .
I don &apos;t love you anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go .
She is a mere child .
What kind of dog is that ?
What happened to the money I gave you ?
He &apos;s not very good at it .
I need French for my job .
I thought Tom would be too busy to help us .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
You know I have to go .
You &apos;ve arrived too early .
All of us speak French .
Tell me more .
It &apos;s good to have you with us .
I go right home after work .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
I think I &apos;d like that .
Did you see Tom today ?
We were a little tired .
What do you want me to ask Tom ?
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
He came home exactly at ten .
He &apos;ll understand .
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
Is anybody here ?
I &apos;ll get that .
I don &apos;t want to go with you .
&quot; I am happy , &quot; she said to herself .
You may still do it if you want to .
I &apos;m your father .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do it .
Who is your teacher ?
That &apos;s better .
I &apos;ll stay at my sister &apos;s place .
Tom let us go .
Do they have money ?
I know just what you need .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
How often do you eat out ?
I &apos;m not a teacher .
I &apos;m not your friend .
No one works there anymore .
It was a long time since I &apos;ve done that .
I &apos;ll finish it in two or three minutes .
What are you going to do in Boston ?
Can you tell me what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
She can speak French .
Can somebody please help me ?
He gave me a watch .
I love Tom .
I &apos;ll go to Boston with Tom .
Tom has been like a father to me .
Are you happy ?
Tom tried to get Mary to help John .
People are looking at you .
What you did made Tom happy .
Maybe you can &apos;t hear me .
Tom thought Mary was busy .
It &apos;s safe here .
Can you do this without any help ?
What makes you happy makes me happy .
My cat is white .
I &apos;m sorry about that .
Tom came with Mary .
Tom can speak French pretty well .
I have to get to school .
I don &apos;t know that word .
I prefer it that way .
She is not up yet .
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
I know Tom wants us to help him .
I was a little afraid .
Tom has lots of friends to help him .
That &apos;s very good .
It &apos;s not your money that I want .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at all .
I want us to be a family .
When do I get there ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time to help Mary right now .
Tom will be here today .
I want to come .
I don &apos;t think Tom has as much money as Mary does .
I want to hear it from you .
You have to see it .
The police are here .
Do you have money ?
I like it very much .
What I want to know is why .
Tom is looking good today .
We have enough time to catch the train .
They lost again .
I hope you &apos;ll soon get well .
You know what Tom said , don &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t even know you had a boyfriend .
I can &apos;t hear you .
I know exactly where it is .
Tom does what he &apos;s told .
Please leave Tom alone .
How old are you ?
How does Tom go to school ?
I &apos;m going to bed now .
Tom asked Mary not to leave .
Where did you see Tom ?
Tom looked good .
I still don &apos;t know how to do this .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go back to work .
I &apos;m not in Boston .
We don &apos;t have time for this .
May I ask you a question ?
Tom also speaks a little French .
Tom has nothing .
You could have come to me .
Tom would &apos;ve liked what you said .
Tom is no longer here .
I was good .
That &apos;s quite possible .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find a job .
Tom and I are afraid .
Tom , I need your help .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
I &apos;ve got nothing left .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
Everybody &apos;s talking .
You are my friend .
I wish you &apos;d said that before .
Are you in on this ?
My watch may be one or two minutes fast .
Tom wants a watch like yours .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t .
Maybe I should write a letter to Tom .
She knows where we live .
Tom did nothing .
Tom will find you .
Did you really say that ?
Are you as tired as I am ?
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
I &apos;ll let you know .
I have one in the car .
Tom and Mary are waiting .
I really like them .
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
I have to do that .
What time is it by your watch ?
You &apos;re my girlfriend .
It &apos;ll be there .
There &apos;s a lot of money involved .
He did what I wanted right away .
Let them talk .
I shouldn &apos;t have been driving .
What did Tom actually do ?
I will speak with you tomorrow .
Tom should have left earlier .
What &apos;s that got to do with Tom ?
Mary used to be beautiful .
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
It doesn &apos;t concern you .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
We &apos;re alone .
It &apos;s not about the money , is it ?
Where &apos;s your sister ?
Tom is tall .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
I &apos;m pretty sure it was Tom that I saw .
You &apos;ve got to help me .
I may not have time .
What is Tom doing here ?
When do you want to do this ?
Tom needs more .
Tom says Mary isn &apos;t happy .
There &apos;s only one window in my room .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
I think we should go now .
What did this Tom say ?
It is time I left here .
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
This is Tom &apos;s book .
Who is your friend ?
You don &apos;t want to go , do you ?
She hasn &apos;t come yet .
It &apos;ll be fun to visit Boston .
We want to take it .
Tom can &apos;t do everything himself .
Don &apos;t say that .
I don &apos;t think you know what you want .
They &apos;re no good .
I wish somebody would help me do that .
He didn &apos;t say anything .
Tom is not happy with this .
Tom wouldn &apos;t eat .
I am very tall .
I &apos;m not here for you .
I &apos;ve got nothing to do .
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
I think Tom should go .
Nobody knows what has become of her .
I &apos;m going to go with Tom .
Tom knows that I don &apos;t like him .
Are you as tired as I am ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
I want to read this book .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
Here &apos;s $ 5 .
How did you come by these books ?
We &apos;ve got a problem here .
He can do it better than me .
Tom is the same age as I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t work anymore .
Do you want kids ?
I love you just as you are .
Tom is not happy to be here .
I know Tom was right .
Tom was sleepy .
Did Tom buy it ?
I will go out when I have finished this work .
I may not come .
I cannot understand what you say .
My family is not that large .
Tom wants to become a teacher .
What does Tom want me to do ?
Leave us .
Tom is just like you .
I don &apos;t know you .
Has anyone ever told you that you &apos;re beautiful ?
I want to know who &apos;s coming with us .
Tom had no food .
She &apos;s not as tall as him .
It doesn &apos;t matter now .
Tom is a good man .
He often comes late to school .
Tom is going to be back from Australia tomorrow .
They understand us .
Can your brother drive a car ?
He gave me his word .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
No one &apos;s going to do that .
Thank you for not saying anything .
That &apos;s not a cat . It &apos;s a dog .
Pass it to me .
He did it right away .
Tom isn &apos;t so old that he can &apos;t work .
I &apos;m a child .
It &apos;s time for bed .
What is wrong with these people ?
I got Tom to help .
My clock is two minutes fast .
Where can we meet you ?
Do you remember what you said ?
What do you want me to do there ?
Tom asked me to talk to Mary .
We both know what you &apos;re doing .
Where did it happen ?
Tom can hear Mary very well .
I gave Tom my word that I wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary about that .
The food disagreed with him .
Do you have a table ?
Tom is going .
The time has come .
Tom knew that the story wasn &apos;t true .
I don &apos;t know why they do it .
Tom let me drive his car .
I don &apos;t have a house in Boston .
We &apos;ll go after we eat .
Thanks for coming , Tom .
That book &apos;s mine .
What are you guys up to ?
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve said .
I already told Tom everything .
Tom hasn &apos;t been living here long .
I can &apos;t ever be what you were .
I &apos;ll come to your place .
Tom wants to see it .
Did you go to see a doctor ?
The boy was tired .
We only want to help you , Tom .
Tom is going to know what to do .
One can always find time .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
I was just about to go to bed .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
What &apos;re we supposed to do with that ?
I know a lot about Australia .
Did Tom go , too ?
Is the road all right to drive on ?
Tom eats very quickly .
I said I &apos;ll get it .
I know Tom &apos;s family .
Tom wasn &apos;t scared .
What are you going to be when you grow up ?
Is that what he wants ?
He found it .
Tom went out to eat .
He looks happy .
Tom saw her .
I wrote that book .
Tom won &apos;t be doing that anymore .
Why did this happen ?
I &apos;m thinking of going .
Let &apos;s do it again .
This is better than nothing .
This has been a long week .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like that .
I &apos;d like to see her .
I &apos;ll be back after lunch .
Tom is enjoying himself .
I don &apos;t like you either .
You should learn French .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t completely alone .
I know exactly where you are .
Like his father , he has many books .
I told the police everything I know .
We are glad to help you .
Tom looks very sleepy .
He can be counted on .
Tom is going to be back here soon .
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
These people are my friends .
The cops are on their way .
Tom is a friend of the family .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy it .
We can &apos;t help Tom now .
Tom didn &apos;t know exactly what it was that Mary wanted him to do .
Give me that one .
He &apos;s at home right now .
Tom saw them .
We &apos;ve seen him .
We have two children .
I don &apos;t know everybody in this school .
She was very busy .
Let &apos;s not study French today .
Tom is hardly ever at home .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
What &apos;s all that ?
Tom is going to be sorry .
Why didn &apos;t you guys tell me ?
If you have questions , ask away .
I don &apos;t know who he is .
Tom needs work .
I want to know .
This is what I have to do .
You &apos;re with me , aren &apos;t you ?
Do you have some money ?
I have no idea who that is either .
I haven &apos;t been busy since yesterday .
I wish that I could give you something .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long he &apos;ll have to wait for Mary .
It must be Tom .
What were you and Tom doing yesterday ?
Tom came to my rescue .
That &apos;s the car I &apos;m going to buy .
I asked Tom if there was something I could buy for him .
Tom let Mary do whatever she wanted to do .
I don &apos;t have anything to do now .
You must eat something .
That &apos;s how I like it .
What does that have to do with you ?
Did he go to see Mary ?
I &apos;ll be happy to do it .
Who &apos;s talking ?
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
He &apos;s not in .
Do you have it ?
You ought to know .
We &apos;ve seen her .
Tom is making his bed .
Tom can &apos;t say for sure how many times Mary has been to Boston .
Those are my books .
You have to help us .
I &apos;m hoping that doesn &apos;t happen .
Who gave you that ?
I &apos;ll see you when I get there .
I wonder what Tom is doing now .
An error was made .
Here &apos;s the answer to your question .
When shall we meet again ?
How long have Tom and Mary been going out together ?
I know that you know that I know .
That &apos;s not good .
I have to tell you the truth .
Tom saw that Mary was busy .
Tom needs your help .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
She lost both her parents .
What &apos;s going on in here ?
Tom said it was none of my business .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
I don &apos;t want to live my life like this .
Have you seen enough ?
Thanks for nothing , Tom .
Tom will soon be a father .
What are your plans for today ?
I &apos;m all for that .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
Tom bought a car .
Did you give Tom something to eat ?
Here &apos;s a book for your mother to read .
I knew you &apos;d like that .
I &apos;m coming .
I &apos;m fairly confident that I can do that .
What do you plan on doing tonight ?
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
I want to talk to you .
There is the train at 10 o &apos;clock .
Where did you hear that story ?
Tom wants to come with us .
I am not the person I used to be .
I think Tom can do that .
They don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
Have you written to Tom ?
Tom has to be here .
She doesn &apos;t have any children , does she ?
He told me that he had lost his watch .
I want time .
It &apos;s up to us .
I know nothing about you .
They &apos;ll come .
Tom is afraid of you .
I have little money now .
What is he like ?
Tom would just like to talk .
I have to speak to Tom immediately .
I love you for who you are .
I forgot Tom knew how to read French .
Tom knows some French .
I know that Tom was at your house today .
He is a teacher .
He speaks quickly .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
Tom wanted it .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
I want a boyfriend .
The teacher has three times as many books as I do .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s Tom .
I &apos;m very sorry .
I &apos;ve never heard Tom say anything like that .
We &apos;ll get it .
What do you want from me ?
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
Why did you do that ?
You must tell me .
Tom needs to see me right away .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d like you to assist Tom .
Who &apos;s the girl at the door ?
He showed off his new watch .
I can &apos;t speak to Tom .
I like this room .
Why didn &apos;t Tom come ?
I may do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary &apos;s living there alone .
I think I &apos;m going to stay here .
I don &apos;t ever want to do this again .
We have to get back before Tom does .
Tom had dinner with Mary .
She is opening the window .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
What happened to you last night ?
I was absent from school because I was sick .
What was Tom up to ?
I &apos;m quite sure of it .
Tom might hear you .
We will be together forever .
Let Tom live .
They were in that room with me all night .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
Tom knows exactly what he wants .
My mother was sick for two days .
I &apos;m not sure whether Tom heard it or not .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
Can you see that ?
He &apos;s on his last legs .
I will make a man of you .
Tom is very tall .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
Could you please take me back home ?
I can &apos;t talk to girls .
Why do you like Boston ?
I really don &apos;t like Tom .
You have what it takes .
Is that your sister ?
I like Tom , but he doesn &apos;t like me .
What did Tom do this time ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a wife .
I am not like you .
We &apos;re at home .
I don &apos;t know how to swim either .
I can take the bus .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
I know a man who can speak French well .
I just want to do my job .
I know what to do .
I can &apos;t live without you .
Tom is kind to Mary .
He has a little money .
I need to know by tomorrow .
He can speak only a little English .
Here is your dog . Where is mine ?
I can &apos;t understand this word .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
What do you have in your hand ?
My sister is three years old .
Tom and I don &apos;t do that .
What don &apos;t you want us to see ?
Why would I tell you ?
We must find it .
My work is done .
I don &apos;t know what to do either .
Tom saw Mary at the station .
I don &apos;t want to talk to him anymore .
We need to do a better job .
I think Tom may want to do that .
Where is the railway station ?
They aren &apos;t like us .
I &apos;m in bed .
I &apos;m busy , too .
I no longer need it .
What do you have to say ?
I thought I &apos;d go with you .
I did it and I would do it again .
You can &apos;t say that .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
Tom should know .
Tom went missing .
Tom likes it here .
Tom can do that without my help .
I met Tom tonight .
Tom and Mary want you there , too .
Tom said he &apos;d help Mary .
You know who they are .
I only want to help Tom .
Does Tom have a big family ?
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s that simple .
I don &apos;t know what they want .
Why do you say things like that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
Tom and Mary are no longer a couple .
Where did Tom see you ?
I &apos;ll be coming home .
Tom and Mary are like that .
Let &apos;s wait here .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French , and neither do I .
She hardly ate anything .
I want to know who did that .
Tom is a really nice kid .
How did you come by these books ?
I wonder what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
What do you want to say to Tom ?
I think you &apos;d like it in Boston .
I need your help .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
What do you need ?
You might have to do this all by yourself .
I &apos;ll need your help .
We &apos;re not in Boston .
I arrived too early .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
No one left .
Do we have one ?
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
We &apos;re here because we want to talk to Tom .
Has anybody come ?
Maybe they can be happy .
Tom is very sorry .
I already knew this .
This is Tom &apos;s .
You &apos;re my friend .
Tom has a friend in Boston .
I didn &apos;t say it like that .
I like to know what &apos;s going on .
I guess they really weren &apos;t all that busy .
What do I need ?
Have you forgotten about me ?
I am disgusted with him .
I want to see your house .
Tom has given his word .
I want to know your opinion .
Please let me go .
I &apos;ll never be your friend .
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
Can &apos;t we just be friends ?
He told me that he would see it once more .
Who &apos;s there ?
I think he takes after his father .
He doesn &apos;t know English at all .
Is Tom ill ?
What &apos;s Tom going to say about that ?
How come you know so much ?
I &apos;m not like that .
Time is up .
I &apos;d love to know that .
What about his girlfriend ?
I am short of money .
Do you really live alone ?
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you . I want to help you .
I know where Tom is .
Tom is going to want to do that .
That &apos;s not a proper thing to say .
I &apos;m going to drive myself .
Tom is speaking .
We will talk about this later .
I was scared of Tom .
I let the cat into my room .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
Tom will never know .
Are they still in bed ?
Please don &apos;t go .
I &apos;d do it if I could .
That doesn &apos;t concern you .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
I &apos;m here to take you home .
Tom hardly ever makes a mistake .
Tom has never been back to Boston .
We can &apos;t do this anymore .
It &apos;s not my fault .
I &apos;m very tall .
I told Tom not to come .
He was not feeling well .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom found something .
I don &apos;t know any more than you do .
I don &apos;t remember who gave me this .
I &apos;d like to know where you are .
Here , this one &apos;s yours .
Where &apos;s my food ?
Aren &apos;t you happy where you are ?
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
We don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He may be the very man that I need .
This wasn &apos;t an easy task .
What are you going to do to me ?
It would have been better if you had left it unsaid .
Is it too late ?
You &apos;re just like your mother .
I can &apos;t understand this at all .
I knew Tom would like it here .
Speaking English isn &apos;t easy .
I &apos;m so sorry .
I think that &apos;s what it is .
I think Tom knows French .
That &apos;s not a real word .
Who could forget it ?
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
This isn &apos;t safe .
He doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
Tom has to stay in Australia for one more week .
What are you getting out of this ?
He ran out of money .
We &apos;re doing OK .
I barely know you .
Tom realized that he wasn &apos;t the same as the other kids .
I wish that I could give you something .
Tom could &apos;ve said something .
There wasn &apos;t anything I could do to help Tom .
Have you done this kind of thing before ?
That &apos;ll make me happy .
Life isn &apos;t always simple .
This watch is my father &apos;s .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom hadn &apos;t done that ?
We want to see you .
What are they saying ?
The door is open .
Tom wanted to live .
This isn &apos;t good .
Tom may have been sick .
That &apos;s what I would &apos;ve done .
What &apos;s Tom have to do with it ?
Tom gave me this watch .
I don &apos;t want to play anymore .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;ve been here for three hours .
She can &apos;t drive a car .
How is your wife doing ?
I &apos;m busy .
You &apos;ll have to come with me .
Where &apos;s your family , Tom ?
When her mother came , she pretended to be studying .
He told the truth .
Tom had nothing to eat .
It isn &apos;t Tom .
I &apos;ve always done that that way .
I wish I could join you .
I &apos;ll be done in five minutes .
How long do I have to stay ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
I think I might be able to speak French better than Tom .
No one likes to do that .
Tom is going to do it .
We have enough food .
Tom said Mary is often late .
My mother is out there .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
We can &apos;t stay here .
I only have a few hours .
This is where I want to be .
I &apos;d like to see what you have in your hand .
I know .
We &apos;ve always done it this way .
They &apos;ll do it .
I can &apos;t give Tom these .
Who is there ?
They &apos;re just doing their job .
Are you up ?
Tom would like nothing more than to tell Mary everything .
His car is two years old .
I should &apos;ve stayed .
This is something Tom made for you .
I didn &apos;t want that .
I &apos;m a teacher .
I have to get back to work .
Where can I buy books ?
What was Tom &apos;s response ?
I just found them .
Tom asked for Mary &apos;s help .
I don &apos;t like Boston that much .
Did you get her letter ?
I always wanted to do that .
Let the children play .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was that old .
I know where you want to be .
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
She did not say anything .
How do you say that in French ?
That &apos;s me .
Are you tall ?
Tom said that .
Tom is playing in his room .
I have something else for you .
They &apos;re very , very good .
You will stay at home .
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
Did you enjoy reading that book ?
You &apos;re old .
What is this car doing here ?
Boston is my home now .
I don &apos;t know if he would have done it for me .
Do you know who said that ?
Where did the other one go ?
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Tom likes that one .
Tom wants to read a book .
I know how I am .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
We will come together .
You &apos;d better get going .
Tom knows he has to do it .
This bicycle belongs to me .
I want this to be yours .
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
They &apos;re there alone .
Tom didn &apos;t even know who Mary was .
It was the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
As it is , I can do nothing .
Tom has lots of time .
Is that what you &apos;re suggesting ?
I mean it !
Tom will drive you home .
Tom likes them both .
Why didn &apos;t I think of it myself ?
Speaking French is a lot of fun .
Tom looks tired , doesn &apos;t he ?
You must do it even if you don &apos;t want to .
I hope no one sees us .
We have all the time in the world .
Is that really Tom &apos;s sister ?
What &apos;s Tom have to say about this ?
You can &apos;t count on his help .
I think I &apos;d like to be your friend .
All of us can speak French .
We know who you are .
I &apos;ll talk with you when you &apos;re not busy .
I knew it was Tom .
I love you , too .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
Tom , Mary already has a boyfriend .
You should go home .
That cannot be true .
I should &apos;ve been there .
Tom asked for some money .
Tom is very happy in Boston .
We &apos;re not lost .
I know almost nothing about Boston .
You aren &apos;t alone .
Tom is my brother .
Can I see that ?
I want a book to read .
There &apos;s someone else I want to see .
My father has made me what I am .
What is it ?
I sincerely hope for his happiness .
Tom gives us money .
I love you more than ever .
I never want to see your face again .
What did you tell Tom ?
Who is better at French , Tom or Mary ?
Is this book yours ?
There &apos;s got to be something you can do .
We eat so that we can live .
Why aren &apos;t you in there ?
That &apos;s all I saw .
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mother .
I &apos;d like to see your father .
My mother can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Are you sure you want to do that ?
I &apos;m okay .
You &apos;ve been really helpful .
Is your wife tall ?
How did Tom find you ?
The clock is ten minutes slow .
I don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
I lost the watch that my father gave me .
I can &apos;t live without him .
That &apos;s not what Tom does .
Is it that hard ?
I feel sorry for her .
Tom , are all these books yours ?
I should tell Tom the truth .
I must leave now .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten a thing all day .
I have to get ready for work .
They can &apos;t hear you .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Have you seen him before ?
There &apos;s a man here that wants to see you .
I want that book .
We already ate .
It &apos;s time to go home now .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it further .
Nobody saw anything .
This one is on me .
I &apos;d like to see your sister .
What are Tom &apos;s true intentions ?
Tom is going out with Mary .
She dumped me .
I want to know why you did that .
It happened again , didn &apos;t it ?
If you really want to know , all you have to do is ask .
Do you want to go to Boston ?
Tom has come to Boston .
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said ?
It &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t your boyfriend .
Tom heard nothing .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
We love having Tom back .
She is like a hen with one chicken .
My father will help me .
When was the last time you saw her ?
Tom could tell Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
I didn &apos;t want that to happen .
What will you make ?
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Tom is just pretending to be sick .
Tom isn &apos;t up yet .
I bought a book yesterday .
Tom can swim .
That &apos;s not what Tom says .
That can &apos;t be .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
Can you do that ?
You can &apos;t let Tom go outside .
I &apos;ve got to find Tom .
I can drive a car , but Tom can &apos;t .
It &apos;s a matter of time .
Tell me what to do with it .
That &apos;s my dad .
This is my cat .
Why should I be afraid of Tom ?
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
This is good , isn &apos;t it ?
I think that you &apos;re right .
Let Tom do this .
Where do you have to be ?
I think I know what it is .
Where &apos;s the train station ?
You &apos;re like me .
I think I &apos;ll take this one .
What time do you want me to be here ?
They know something we don &apos;t .
I think this is for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it here .
Isn &apos;t that your car , Tom ?
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
We &apos;ll be there .
It happens .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
Tom wanted more .
Tom did it just for fun .
She won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
I hope that this isn &apos;t a mistake .
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
How often do I have to tell you ?
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
You must have lost them .
I will help you .
How many times have you done this ?
I wish I had seen her .
Why did she come home early ?
What don &apos;t you like about your job ?
Are you in Boston ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know why .
It looks good on you .
You &apos;re very busy .
You wouldn &apos;t want that to happen , would you ?
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I have to help my mother .
I &apos;m not a bit tired .
He wants more .
I want Tom to go home .
The question is how much .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
She looks like her mother .
Are you all alone ?
We &apos;re going to get that .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do .
I can &apos;t tell her now . It &apos;s not that simple anymore .
I &apos;m not happy with it .
I have very little money .
He didn &apos;t see a thing .
I &apos;ll take you home .
It &apos;s not your problem , anyway .
I &apos;ll meet her tomorrow .
Did you say something ?
It is entirely up to him whether he does it or not .
My friend has a large family .
I don &apos;t want to become like those people .
I cannot do without this book .
I was just about to go home .
I can handle it myself .
Tom is always happy .
This is for you , I think .
Let &apos;s hit the town tonight and have some fun .
What do I get out of it ?
I know what I &apos;ll do .
Tom and Mary are very happy .
We &apos;ll use what we have .
Why don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
We &apos;re going to be here all day .
If I were you , I would not do it .
Do you want to be here ?
I can wait no longer .
We know about Tom .
She is beautiful .
My parents don &apos;t know .
We are not alone .
We lost sight of each other .
What was your mother doing when you got home ?
Why don &apos;t you all come with me ?
I know you can do this .
Tom asked Mary to read it for him .
I don &apos;t want to believe you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
What &apos;s Tom good at doing ?
I &apos;m sure Tom will understand .
Tom is as old as Mary .
We &apos;re all going .
You could have told me .
This work is anything but easy .
We don &apos;t know what to do .
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents about us ?
They aren &apos;t my books .
Tom said he needed some more time .
It is just five o &apos;clock .
Tom has just left .
Can you tell me the way to the station ?
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
Everybody is waiting for you .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem ?
I can &apos;t eat .
Are you my father ?
I &apos;ve been better .
What do you want ?
Tom is at home today .
Did they say how ?
What they say is true .
We need to do it immediately .
We were friends .
Tom was home alone .
This clock is mine .
Tom would help us if he could .
I don &apos;t want to play with you .
Why do you want this ?
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John in a long time .
That wouldn &apos;t be Tom , would it ?
We have to do it together .
Who knows what you saw ?
What &apos;s happened to the money ?
Tom and Mary have what they want .
What is it you need ?
I want to eat .
Many people were there .
Tom said he was afraid .
She wouldn &apos;t even speak to him .
Tom does want this , doesn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
Is this your dog ?
Where did Tom buy this book ?
I don &apos;t know him .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
Tom does it all the time .
Tom &apos;s girlfriend saw him with another girl .
When are you coming back home ?
Do you know who she is ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to hear anything I had to say .
How did you make it ?
Tom has enough money to buy it .
I wish I hadn &apos;t done that .
Are you scared of me ?
She could not find her way back .
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
We want to go .
Tom said he &apos;s not going to do that .
I hope he isn &apos;t ill .
I already said I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Is this true ?
I don &apos;t care for him .
I was just going to do that .
Tom knows Mary knows .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
I want to go home .
I cannot read French .
She didn &apos;t go there yesterday .
They &apos;re coming home .
Do you know how many people are here ?
Don &apos;t give me anything .
I &apos;m tied up now .
How beautiful !
Tom still hasn &apos;t come back .
There &apos;s no water .
My watch is ten minutes slow .
I thought Tom loved Mary .
It &apos;s all in the room .
Tom won &apos;t be back tomorrow .
What should we tell the others ?
That &apos;s for sure .
When is he coming back ?
I &apos;m going to take my car .
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
They know about it .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to him .
I &apos;ve met that girl before .
That &apos;s not a cat . That &apos;s a dog .
He asked after you .
Tom wanted to talk with you .
I am okay .
I bought her a watch .
What have you been up to lately ?
I really ought to go .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I want to know where they are .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been there .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston .
She &apos;s a lot better today .
I &apos;ll tell you .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
Tom hasn &apos;t come here yet .
I hope that he will come .
I don &apos;t mean you .
Can you see Tom ?
My father &apos;s a doctor .
You can &apos;t go .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this .
You learn quickly .
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Did Tom say what happened exactly ?
Tom has been here for three years .
Tom has a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
That &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
You didn &apos;t tell me Tom speaks French .
I made this for you .
We have no school tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
You can have it .
I don &apos;t know anything .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
They had no money left .
Why do you want it ?
I know what I saw .
She was busy .
I will never be your friend .
He looks like my father .
He has no house in which to live .
I know my way around Australia .
My watch loses three minutes a week .
Tom didn &apos;t have anything to say .
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
In Japan , all children go to school .
I think I know what you need .
He &apos;s too old for me .
I want to meet Tom .
They are in the way .
Tom is up .
Tom told me that he was very tired .
He hasn &apos;t come yet .
Tom is always very busy .
Don &apos;t you want to do this ?
I didn &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
Did Tom have dinner ?
Do you want to hear the truth ?
I came by car .
He is doing well .
That was hard to believe .
I want you to have it .
Do you want another one of these ?
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
Tom hasn &apos;t said anything either .
Tom has many friends to help him .
I like that .
You &apos;d better tell Tom you &apos;re sorry .
Tom is out , but Mary is here .
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
Where is the railroad station ?
Tom is going to school in Australia .
What do you want ?
Are you almost ready ?
They might be able to help us .
Can we talk about this later ?
How long can you stay ?
We lost sight of him .
Doing that wouldn &apos;t be right , would it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like doing that .
I want it .
Tom and Mary gave me that .
We know what we &apos;re doing .
We &apos;ll be seeing you .
This never happened .
You have only three minutes left .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
Tom comes to Boston once a year .
Tom has friends all over the world .
I want to spend more time with my family .
My watch is very precise .
We &apos;re not always right .
How do you put up with it ?
Tom is with his mother .
I think Tom likes doing that .
What did Tom do with the money ?
Where did you eat ?
Tom asked Mary to leave .
Tom abandoned me .
What happened here ?
I &apos;m not your son .
When does Tom get here ?
My mother gets up earlier than I do .
Why don &apos;t I have a girlfriend ?
I like coming to Boston .
Tom knows Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
He likes to talk about himself .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
You ought to wait for Tom .
I no longer want that .
Tom , this is Mary &apos;s brother John .
He shall have it .
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
I have lots of friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at work .
Tom thought no one was at home .
Where did you eat last night ?
Tom should study French .
What do you enjoy doing ?
He spends too much money .
I &apos;ll stay until tomorrow .
If only it were that simple .
Do you have any children ?
No one &apos;s home .
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to bed so late yesterday .
It &apos;s not like I don &apos;t want to do it .
He came out of the room .
They &apos;re not here .
What can you tell me about this ?
You won &apos;t be needing that .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I &apos;ve got to get back to work .
They were right .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
Can you tell me what is happening ?
No one was listening .
There &apos;s a cat in my house .
The girl said nothing .
We have one for you , too .
He wanted to meet you .
The children are already tired .
Can I go with you ?
He ran away with the money .
What will they do ?
We can talk about it .
What should Tom do ?
I want to hear you say it .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
Why can &apos;t we just tell Tom that we can &apos;t do it ?
I really want to know what &apos;s happening here .
You know who I am , don &apos;t you ?
He admitted his mistakes .
Tom wanted to meet Mary .
The food &apos;s not ready yet .
What do you want to do ?
He didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
I go straight home after work .
Tom wants to do it .
They aren &apos;t happy to see Tom .
I &apos;m a little early .
Do you know who they are ?
I &apos;m thinking about it .
I asked Tom to wait for a few more minutes .
I &apos;ve only been there once .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
How many people work there ?
You aren &apos;t here .
When do you return home ?
I get on well with him .
That &apos;s one way of doing it .
Did Tom tell you that ?
Tom has good eyesight .
I &apos;m not worried about it at all .
Tom looks busy today .
I didn &apos;t mean anything by that .
Tom likes this .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure .
It &apos;s very good .
I am not a teacher .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
I hope to see you .
Tom used to date Mary .
This doesn &apos;t involve you .
I &apos;d do it .
I believe you .
I &apos;m not sure yet , but I think I &apos;ll become a teacher .
Tom isn &apos;t feeling well .
You are good .
Tom came on his own .
Can I help you ?
This is a dog .
I &apos;m going downtown .
I &apos;ve still got a lot of work to do .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that happening .
How much money have you got ?
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s father .
Tom never wrote to me .
I don &apos;t like your dog .
It was night .
Tom says it &apos;s up to Mary .
I have to get home .
Tom and I always tell each other everything .
I think Tom could do that .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like Tom .
I know you have a girlfriend .
Tom should &apos;ve known .
I only have one brother .
I think I &apos;m a good teacher .
I think they saw me .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
He and I are friends .
Why are we doing this ?
We &apos;re out of money .
They know I know .
Tom will speak .
Do you want another one of these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t do that anymore .
I just did it .
Tom has a cat , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t know her at all .
That is our school .
Tom said he only needed a few more minutes .
Everyone is happy .
I don &apos;t know anything about Boston .
Where do we go from here ?
I can &apos;t help you with that .
I no longer believe it .
I could have bought that for you .
We &apos;re happy .
Is this correct ?
They &apos;re not happy .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
I &apos;ve just gotten home .
All of us speak French .
How did you get into the house ?
I &apos;m here , too .
Tom took it .
I can &apos;t believe that .
I am able to drive a car .
This is the watch that I bought yesterday .
I saw Tom again last night .
That &apos;s not very good .
We all make mistakes .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
We can do a lot more .
He looks as if he had been ill .
He &apos;s afraid that he might be late .
I &apos;d like to ask you about Tom .
You are making history .
Can you stay for a few days ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want it .
Who &apos;s your girlfriend ?
I know you &apos;re not scared .
The boy has no food .
I want Tom to know that .
What did you guys do ?
Tell Tom I won &apos;t be there .
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
This is my friend .
I can &apos;t live that kind of life .
Don &apos;t bother seeing me to the door .
Don &apos;t you know who I am ?
I don &apos;t like your name .
He doesn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
Do you want me to go with you ?
I wrote it for Tom .
I don &apos;t believe you can do it .
The food &apos;s ready .
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
Tom had only three dollars with him .
He has no bicycle .
Tom will be back home soon .
I would like to hear your opinion .
There is one problem .
It could be true .
Tom didn &apos;t see me .
I &apos;m very busy .
I want to talk to her .
Do you have a book ?
There it is .
Tom has a bicycle .
How long have they been here ?
I was very happy .
What did you do today ?
How did you come by such a large sum of money ?
I &apos;ll be there all day .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
Just give it up , Tom .
You have him there .
I went to the room .
I can &apos;t put up with it any longer .
You don &apos;t have to work today .
She did the work alone .
I &apos;m happy , too .
I know it &apos;s not easy .
What do you want from Tom ?
Do you want these ?
This doesn &apos;t concern you , Tom .
I &apos;m not too late , am I ?
I can &apos;t help you with that .
I know what I know .
Tom likes Mary , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
I like your car .
I lost sight of my friends .
How are you today ?
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
Nobody wants to talk about that .
When are you free ?
I &apos;m not good with names .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What did they tell you ?
Tom and Mary are here , too .
Tom didn &apos;t get everything he wanted .
I have two children .
She also speaks French .
It &apos;s too late .
Is this your money ?
I &apos;ve found the answer .
I had dinner with Tom .
The baby is due any day now .
Tom didn &apos;t fall .
Maybe I just need some time alone .
She doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
I wish things were the way they used to be .
Tom is walking towards Mary .
I wish I could do something .
I gave him the book .
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
I wrote a letter to my teacher .
What did Tom just say to you ?
I &apos;m almost finished .
That &apos;s a school .
I &apos;ve already done that once today .
&quot; Who is in the car ? &quot; &quot; Tom is . &quot;
Tom can swim , but Mary can &apos;t .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s good .
He is sick .
What &apos;re Tom and Mary doing here ?
We &apos;re going to get you home .
I had to talk to Tom .
I &apos;d better be going .
That &apos;s not what Tom is asking .
Don &apos;t you want these ?
We don &apos;t know what it is .
They lost .
It made me very happy .
I don &apos;t think that Tom has a dog .
I love it .
Maybe I should go .
I think Tom likes to do that .
Why is Tom so scared ?
I want to go to school in Australia .
I already know .
I know what those books are like .
I went to school with Tom .
What was I saying ?
We need money .
I wish I had more time .
I love coffee .
Tom is like me .
We have to leave in five minutes .
Do you know how to speak English ?
Tom is too busy to come .
Can you ride a bicycle ?
Get me some , too .
What &apos;s going on with you and Tom ?
I did it for you .
We &apos;ve only got three days .
Tom and I are giving up .
We can do it right now .
You know what , Tom , you &apos;re right .
He looks tired this evening .
Tom is safe now .
He has a crush on this girl .
There &apos;s something I need to ask you .
I &apos;ve seen that .
What do I have ?
We saw everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t have as many friends as Mary does .
We didn &apos;t do anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is in Boston .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
He asked a favor of me .
You &apos;re tired .
Tom never talks about money .
I was away .
I wanted Tom to do that .
It belongs to us .
Tom said he &apos;d come .
I &apos;m not tired .
You can rely on me .
I want to know what &apos;s going on .
Tom thought that Mary was busy .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
Tom knew he didn &apos;t have enough money .
He is not a physician .
Tom could &apos;ve gone .
I &apos;d just like to talk .
Tom took his own life .
Don &apos;t tell me what to eat .
I &apos;ll go to Tom .
Tom is in .
Tom wanted to know where Mary was .
This is my brother &apos;s .
Tom wants his children to learn French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play outside today .
You &apos;re just a kid .
She will be back at five .
They &apos;re afraid of Tom .
What &apos;s up with you ?
I came to see how you &apos;re doing .
Let me help you with that .
Was it fun doing that ?
Are you scared ?
I &apos;m busy today .
You &apos;ve got to see her home .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
Don &apos;t tell Tom where you live .
I think so , too .
I will help him tomorrow .
I need only one cat .
Tom was sick .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
They want Tom .
Nobody ever told me that before .
He came to my rescue .
Don &apos;t give it to Tom .
I think that car is Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
I have everything here that I need .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve never seen her .
Tom seems to know a lot about Australia .
How did you come up with that answer ?
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell us anything .
How did you find Tom ?
Tom never does that by himself .
You may be correct .
Tom had no money .
We won &apos;t be doing that .
I really want to go .
You &apos;ve made me very happy .
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
We study French at school .
What if Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to do that ?
Tom and Mary are waiting with John .
There &apos;s something here Tom should see .
I don &apos;t want to live like this .
I will speak to him alone .
Tom looked through the window at the street .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
Tom knows who they are .
I was not sure what to do .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
All of them speak French .
No way !
I have to go back to work .
Is Tom there ?
What do you want to tell us ?
I want to study French .
I know who lives in this house .
You have to make Tom believe you .
Tom had nothing left to eat .
I want to live like that .
Why isn &apos;t that good ?
I don &apos;t have a cat , but Tom does .
We &apos;ll bring Tom .
Tom may have said that .
You can make your own .
What time is it ?
I think you should do it .
I have a cat and a dog .
This isn &apos;t for me .
They are my friends .
I have many friends .
I really am busy .
I said get up !
I need it today .
She said that she had been happy .
That &apos;s for you .
We lost our cat and Tom found it for us .
If you wish , you can go .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary either .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will say .
Tom was here today asking for help .
When did it happen ?
Can you stay with Tom ?
I still haven &apos;t found Tom .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
Is that Tom &apos;s house ?
You have to listen to Tom .
That &apos;s what people don &apos;t understand .
I love money .
He made me happy yesterday .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
I want a car , but I have no money to buy one .
We &apos;re out of time .
I don &apos;t know why my friend wants us to wait .
Tom said something to Mary in French .
When &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
May I go now ?
This is where Tom wants to live .
No one likes Tom .
When you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
When was the last time you saw your children ?
I gave him all the money I had .
I want you to wait for me .
I could barely speak .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t swim .
I love you .
You had better not read this book .
I &apos;ll be going .
Tom likes me .
Why is Tom here ?
We &apos;re going to Boston to see Tom .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
I really like you a lot .
Let &apos;s eat now .
Are you able to swim ?
Tom took one last look around the room before he left .
Tom needs to remain in bed .
How is Tom going to Boston ?
Can someone please help me ?
He just left .
You need help .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I think Tom did this .
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
I only just left Tom .
I find it hard to believe .
I suppose I &apos;d better go .
I wasn &apos;t at home then .
Where have you been all day ?
He doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
Have you found something ?
I think you &apos;re ready .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
Children should obey their parents .
What does this have to do with me ?
May I go with you ?
Tom will find Mary .
I &apos;ll help Tom .
What time is it now ?
I need to talk with you about Tom .
I don &apos;t know and I don &apos;t want to know .
Tom knows what we need .
It was yesterday that I saw him .
You don &apos;t want that .
We &apos;re almost there .
Tom likes to do things by himself .
We &apos;re here .
I arrived here yesterday .
It might be fun .
My son is ten years old .
I don &apos;t think that he will come .
I wonder why everybody left so early .
I think it &apos;s time for us to leave .
Do you have many friends here in Japan ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
Tom is running short of money .
Tom is a father .
I just want to talk .
I don &apos;t know for sure .
We don &apos;t have a single thing to worry about .
I &apos;ve never been there myself .
I want Mary .
He is always scared .
It &apos;s not my problem .
I &apos;m not entirely sure .
Tom didn &apos;t even know I was here .
How much money do you have ?
Tom is coming home .
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t need money to have a good time .
Tom did that .
I am really sorry to hear that .
Tom had nothing to do with it .
These are my parents .
Tom likes you very much .
How are they doing it ?
What &apos;re you eating ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m in Australia .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want me to drive you home ?
How do you like Boston ?
You always were good at your job .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom lives .
You must be back by 10 o &apos;clock .
My father can swim , but my mother can &apos;t .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
Can &apos;t we just talk this over ?
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
Tom ran out of water .
Can you swim ?
Can &apos;t anything be done ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
Do you remember who told you that ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary what John did .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to see Tom soon .
Give them to him .
This is the most fun I &apos;ve had in a long time .
I let Tom drive my car .
Everything went well with him .
This isn &apos;t French . It &apos;s English .
Tom is there .
How much should they get ?
They lost everything .
Tom likes to do everything himself .
I &apos;ll do what I want .
Tom will go alone .
Were they here ?
I don &apos;t know exactly .
This seems too good to be true .
I don &apos;t have to study French .
She might come .
I wanted to help you .
Do you have a girlfriend now ?
It &apos;s up to you and me .
Tom might think that we want him to do that .
I &apos;m up .
Tom gave us nothing .
Please write it down .
I have to go to Boston .
That was fast .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
We &apos;re going home .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
What do you have ?
I don &apos;t know what I should &apos;ve done .
I can &apos;t think of any place I &apos;d rather be .
Why does Tom want to do this ?
How big you are !
Tom said he had a friend in Boston .
Mary is mine .
That &apos;s not where I want to go .
That has nothing to do with me .
How many children do you have ?
Tom always eats before going to work .
You should have told him .
Tom looks weary .
I &apos;m very sorry for being late .
I want to come home .
Have you seen this ?
I &apos;ll be right there , Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a car .
See you there .
I don &apos;t know anything about her .
I &apos;m tired of being sick .
I have to do something .
You &apos;re my child .
So where were you ?
I wish I were in Boston .
Thanks for dropping by .
This is from Tom .
How are they doing this ?
Let us go home .
What does that have to do with me ?
Tom is going to have to do it .
Tom was at school .
That &apos;s how it is done .
That &apos;s very big .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
Here &apos;s what to do .
I wish none of this had ever happened .
That &apos;s how life is .
You need us .
When did you get this ?
No one was late .
I &apos;m not a baby anymore .
That &apos;s what you told me .
Isn &apos;t that Tom ?
I see Tom and Mary .
Why did Tom do it ?
My father has never gotten sick in his life .
A child needs a mother .
I &apos;ll go with Tom and Mary .
Why didn &apos;t you come ?
Tom was too tired to speak .
It &apos;s never that simple .
We &apos;re here to see Tom .
We need to be more like Tom .
Why does this always happen to me ?
What &apos;s going on ?
Where are the children ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
I &apos;ve always done it that way .
We found one .
Is Tom afraid yet ?
Why do people kill themselves ?
You look exactly like Tom .
When did you last see my brother ?
Tom wanted a bicycle .
Tom seems tired .
The girl always looked happy , but she wasn &apos;t at all happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m here .
Tom didn &apos;t keep Mary waiting too long .
I can &apos;t do it either .
Tom found that .
Tom is playing outdoors .
I don &apos;t have as many friends as Tom .
I know that you &apos;ve been waiting for this .
Tom is better looking than you .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
Let Tom come .
What does all this have to do with Tom ?
I should &apos;ve stayed in bed .
Tom , do you want to go with me ?
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
You can hear everything .
I &apos;ve come to see you .
I just told Tom .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
I &apos;m sleepy !
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s friend , aren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
I don &apos;t have enough money .
I have to drive this car .
I wrote to Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t a child anymore .
This belongs to Tom .
Tom was with me .
Tom likes Mary and Mary likes Tom .
Aren &apos;t you going to eat anything ?
Tom didn &apos;t want my help .
I will stay home tomorrow .
Tom and Mary are like family .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s family .
I was worried .
I was sick .
We can &apos;t turn back .
What &apos;re you doing today ?
Are you certain ?
Tom does what he wants .
I wish I could be there with you .
Tom is afraid of Mary .
How much can we take ?
I came to see you .
Tom will like this place .
Are you sure Tom did that ?
I can &apos;t believe it . Tom can &apos;t believe it either .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
How about this one ?
You &apos;d better leave now .
I don &apos;t really have a boyfriend .
Why did you leave ?
I &apos;d rather not eat now .
That &apos;s what they all say .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
Tell me where she lives .
Is what you said about Tom really true ?
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know much .
What do we tell Tom ?
Mary can &apos;t have any more children .
Tom is too old for Mary .
That makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
Tom knows exactly what he needs to do .
I should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
He told me everything .
I gave him a book .
Who gave Tom all that money ?
That &apos;s a good thing to have .
He never saw his brother again .
I can &apos;t talk right now . I need to go .
I know you can make it better .
I don &apos;t want to hear a thing about it .
Tom should be studying French now .
What does Tom see in Mary ?
I &apos;ll be in my car .
I need to help Tom .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom about his brother John .
Tom isn &apos;t himself today .
There &apos;s nothing in this room .
See you tomorrow .
What am I to do ?
It &apos;s not going to be hard to do this .
Tom might get sick .
Why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom was very busy today .
I don &apos;t know why they did that .
I should be at school .
This I have to see .
He dislikes me .
Excuse me .
I have neither time nor money .
Tom wants to talk to you again .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
You don &apos;t have to be afraid .
Tom said that he &apos;d do just about anything for Mary .
Why am I still here ?
They won &apos;t believe me .
There &apos;s no one home .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has been unwell .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know what to do .
I think Tom has made a mistake .
I will not do it again .
Tom likes being alone .
I &apos;m tired of hearing that .
Tom was very sick .
Why did you leave ?
I need to see you immediately .
Tom and I were both right .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
Tom wondered how tall Mary was .
This is how Tom did it .
Hand it to Tom .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
Tom is not yet able to swim .
What Tom wants to do isn &apos;t going to help .
Can I see you tonight ?
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s been quite a week .
That boy is Tom .
Tom wanted to have another baby , but his wife didn &apos;t .
This is how you do it .
Tom says you need my help .
What &apos;re they going to do to Tom and Mary ?
That &apos;s what I like about you .
This car &apos;s mine .
Can you come with me now ?
I &apos;m thinking about you .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything to me .
Who is that man ?
May I ask why it is that you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
How long will you be staying ?
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
Tell me what really happened .
I wish there was more I could &apos;ve done .
I think I &apos;ve heard enough .
Just let me go .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know what Mary is supposed to do .
Tom knew this .
We have to go to school .
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s none of my business .
It &apos;s so simple .
I should &apos;ve known this .
I don &apos;t need this anymore .
I can &apos;t do it .
Tom is going to enjoy this .
Let &apos;s go !
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
I have some friends in Australia .
What are these doing here ?
Tom always speaks French .
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
You &apos;d better not do it .
I almost feel sorry for you .
I have something to ask Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t do things like that .
That makes me very happy .
Why are you alone ?
Tell me it &apos;s not true .
Tom speaks very good French .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
Is he a teacher ?
It &apos;s Tom .
Give me that .
What do I know ?
There was much work to do .
Tom wasn &apos;t feeling well .
I wanted to talk about it .
Who saw you ?
You are exactly like your father .
Has Tom eaten yet ?
It &apos;s quite simple .
If anyone can do that , it &apos;s Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
Did Tom say who did it ?
I can understand Tom .
They &apos;re afraid of him .
Why did I do that ?
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t always right .
It was far from certain .
We &apos;ll take it .
What were you doing at Tom &apos;s house ?
We &apos;re not welcome .
Everything depends on what you will do .
You should &apos;ve known better .
You must make your parents happy .
Tom is dating my sister .
I was just going to say that .
I can &apos;t do anything .
Tom likes to do that here .
Did you buy this book ?
I should &apos;ve gone to Boston with Tom .
Where has Tom gone ?
Tom knows we &apos;re here .
Mary , I love you .
I can &apos;t do what you want .
Tom said he would do it again .
I don &apos;t like to be alone .
You &apos;ve lost everything .
Tom was really sick .
What are you going to do for Tom ?
Do you want to see it again ?
This road will take you to the station .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle .
You should come .
Tom has a lot of money , but he has no friends .
It &apos;s getting late .
Maybe Tom can tell you what needs to be done .
That happens to us all the time .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
I have several good friends .
Tom left ten minutes ago .
Tom was there with one of his friends .
He is afraid of his father .
I &apos;m not your mother .
There &apos;s a lot to do .
Is Tom there alone ?
It may well be true .
What is this ?
I told Tom what Mary did .
I don &apos;t like Tom either .
I can &apos;t quite believe that .
What are we doing today ?
Why are they saying that ?
He is playing in his room .
I don &apos;t like you anymore .
All you have to do is ask .
She gave him the money .
I &apos;d like to know what your opinion is .
She is still a girl .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I don &apos;t know who that man is .
That &apos;s not Tom .
This book isn &apos;t as easy as that one .
How many of you are there ?
The nurse will tell you how to do it .
I don &apos;t know what Tom is doing .
We always take a bus .
The train has not arrived yet .
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you sick ?
It &apos;s a long story .
Who found him ?
I can do more .
Tom will be there .
He would give an arm and a leg for that .
Tom couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
I won &apos;t need you .
I &apos;ll tell you what I want you to do .
Tell Tom to come to Boston .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
I wish I had more money with me .
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
It &apos;s time for our children to go to bed .
Tom hasn &apos;t come home yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary is here .
He came into the room .
I wanted to say thank you for all your help .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
They don &apos;t get it .
What is it you want from me ?
I &apos;ve never been this happy before .
Tom says he met my father .
Have you ever written a book ?
You &apos;ll be here with me .
The question is whether he can do it or not .
Can you swim underwater ?
Tom looked at Mary , but said nothing .
This is theirs .
They &apos;ll find Tom .
Tom said goodnight to Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom never told me that you were so beautiful .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Do you know who lives in that house ?
Are you sure ?
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I heard what happened .
My car is on its last legs .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
I can &apos;t make head nor tail of it .
You said so yourself .
Tom knew I &apos;d be there .
How did that happen ?
I &apos;ve never heard of that city .
How much money does he have ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
There &apos;s something I have to know .
Tom said Mary is at home .
I have work for Tom .
You must be tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
I don &apos;t know where you work .
Tom gave me his word .
I want to know how you did it .
I left right away .
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
What are you going to do there ?
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
What I want is to go home .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for anything .
Tom is going to do that for us .
This book is not available in Japan .
I have nothing to do today .
I &apos;ll let you know .
Tom was able to help Mary .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
I thought so .
That man is Tom .
I wanted to do that with you .
Tom and I often work together .
I don &apos;t have to do that .
They &apos;re tired .
Did Tom give you anything ?
Perhaps he will come .
You must help her .
That &apos;s what I told him .
Where were your parents ?
Can it wait ?
Tom is at home now .
Can you read it ?
They tell me you &apos;re OK .
They found Tom .
You &apos;re cooperating .
I think we &apos;d better be going .
I &apos;m positive Tom can swim .
Tom and I did that .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home yesterday .
She is talking .
Are you afraid of me ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
Does Tom have more than one girlfriend ?
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
A man &apos;s gotta do what a man &apos;s gotta do .
You eat too much .
Tom isn &apos;t scared anymore .
I have to leave now .
I have Tom here with me .
All you have to do is ask .
I wanted Tom to do that .
This one &apos;s for me .
I don &apos;t want to do this here .
They can &apos;t see Tom .
Can you stay with Tom ?
I &apos;d like to do that .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s car ?
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
How was your night ?
I want to go to bed .
I met my teacher on the way to the railway station .
Is Tom ready ?
Everyone &apos;s watching Tom .
Tom won &apos;t believe I did that .
Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom went back to bed .
Tom says this is what he really needs .
I found the money that Tom had lost .
You &apos;re very beautiful .
I want to believe you .
I want Tom to have this .
I can &apos;t stay much longer .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
Is Tom at home now ?
It &apos;s true .
Who is the father ?
Don &apos;t brag .
He had a lot of things to do .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait so long .
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
I really like that girl .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
I &apos;ve got almost everything I need .
We know you have it .
She wasn &apos;t able to talk to him .
This is too much for me .
I love you more than I love her .
We should go .
I need to go back to Australia .
I beg you to help me .
They &apos;re now alone .
You &apos;ve done that already .
That &apos;s not going to help .
Tom works in Boston .
Tom has been here three years .
Tom is the kind of person who always has to have the last word .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary coming ?
She can &apos;t have done such a thing .
This is exactly what we want .
I know what to study .
I don &apos;t have to be here .
I don &apos;t like him either .
I &apos;ll tell Tom right now .
She &apos;s my wife .
I &apos;ve been there before .
Tom and Mary look very tired .
Tom knows we &apos;re coming .
I like my teachers .
I met them .
I know what people want .
He knows hardly anything about it .
There is no need to be frightened . He won &apos;t harm you .
Tom has worked for me for three years .
Tom seems to be happy .
I love this one .
That is how it happened .
I guess I should &apos;ve stayed home .
We had some questions .
How many days did you spend in Boston ?
Tom wanted to speak with Mary .
When do we go ?
Tom can do it .
You must stay with me .
They &apos;re our friends .
I must go now .
Hey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
We learn English at school .
It &apos;s more than enough .
Do you have kids ?
Where &apos;s your friend ?
Where have you been all day ?
Tom arrived too early .
This is my mother .
Where did Tom eat ?
I believe that everything will be okay .
I won &apos;t be busy tomorrow .
Just tell me what you know about the problem .
I got tired very fast .
Tom came along much later .
Tom still lives at home .
Tom gave up too soon .
We often make mistakes .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
I want to know who you are .
How can we meet new people ?
What did you do at that moment ?
I am at home every evening .
I was able to help her .
She is happy .
Are you through with the book ?
She came into the room .
I just got home from school .
Where &apos;s your money ?
I have a wife .
Are you still there ?
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
We can &apos;t go back to Boston .
Who wrote this ?
You said it yourself .
I wish I had a girlfriend .
Tom will be back in a second .
I did everything all by myself .
Tom could speak French .
All these books are mine .
I &apos;m sure Tom will be here soon .
Both of us can speak French .
I don &apos;t want to be late today .
It was her that told me .
Are they gone ?
How did you find us ?
We require your help .
I don &apos;t know who it is .
That &apos;s not how Tom sees it .
He has no money .
What do you want to eat ?
They don &apos;t help .
Let &apos;s go home .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
Mary pretended she was my sister .
It was almost too easy .
I still don &apos;t believe it .
It &apos;s always been like that .
I &apos;m on my way .
When does Tom want to do this ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom saw .
You &apos;re my son .
He isn &apos;t coming , either .
I &apos;ve told you everything I know about Tom .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to Tom &apos;s ?
She tried it herself .
You &apos;re very good .
How &apos;s it coming , Tom ?
I think Tom has to go to Boston .
Tom walked into the room .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
I have to take my son to the doctor .
He went home yesterday .
I &apos;m busy , so I can &apos;t go .
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
Are you absolutely sure ?
I am happy .
I &apos;ve made a mistake .
I think Tom is from Australia .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
I have a lot of work to do today .
There &apos;s nothing to do .
You can do better than this .
How many books does he have ?
Do you know what Tom is doing now ?
What is his age ?
Tom told the truth .
You &apos;re late again .
This is the last time .
I am happy with my girlfriend .
Tom was in bed all morning .
Are you alone right now ?
He &apos;s done this before .
I ate too much .
Tom ate something .
We &apos;re listening .
I have one of those , too .
I think I found something .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
We need to keep this confidential .
I found Tom there .
Do you know what that is ?
He did what they told him .
What do you want to buy ?
Is this for me ?
You didn &apos;t have to come so early .
I don &apos;t know much about your family .
I feel sorry for him .
Tom was dumped by his girlfriend .
Tom and Mary are with me .
Father can swim , but Mother cannot .
You &apos;re killing me .
Do you know how to speak French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to do .
Tom isn &apos;t sick .
Tom intended to tell Mary everything .
Tom is still working for us .
I &apos;d like to work with Tom .
You had better go to bed now .
I need some time with Tom .
What I &apos;m about to say will answer your question .
That seems simple enough .
They know we &apos;re here .
I have what I want .
When &apos;s Tom going to get here ?
Life is what you make it .
Tom looks very tired .
We always want what we can &apos;t have .
I don &apos;t have a problem with this .
Tom can &apos;t drive .
There wasn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to do that .
You should go to the doctor .
Tom wasn &apos;t in .
Tom didn &apos;t mind living by himself .
Tom isn &apos;t finished yet .
That girl is Mary .
Isn &apos;t that a good thing ?
It is a book .
Thanks for the book .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
You can speak French , can &apos;t you ?
She can &apos;t swim .
No one can help you .
We &apos;ve arrived .
They &apos;re waiting for us .
What are you trying to say ?
Where could the cat be ?
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
Tom can &apos;t forget Mary .
Tom has two children .
Tom said he was busy .
Do we have enough time to finish this before Tom gets here ?
Tom is too old for you .
Are they all the same ?
Tom says he &apos;s not done yet .
I have a large family .
We &apos;ve never been to Boston .
I know you &apos;re here .
I saw Tom again .
Tom didn &apos;t say a thing .
How are we feeling today ?
I think we have to go .
What does Tom know about me ?
I think Tom wants our help .
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
Tom hardly talks at all .
I don &apos;t want kids .
I &apos;d like to study French .
Buy it for me , please .
You are no longer a child .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
Tom has one for you .
Mary is tall .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
They &apos;re home .
You are safe here .
I still love you very much .
What &apos;re you going to do with that ?
Tom has a wife and three children .
Is Tom tall ?
I bought this book for myself , not for my wife .
Tom saw where Mary lives .
I &apos;ll do it .
Thanks for your help .
Is it difficult to learn French ?
Tom &apos;s children are sick .
I wasn &apos;t sure what to say .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve met Tom .
I &apos;m doing okay .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
How would you like it if someone did that to you ?
She killed herself yesterday .
You &apos;re not going to believe this .
I will never do it again .
I know the whole of the story .
Tom is frightened .
It &apos;s something Tom made .
I don &apos;t like it here .
Where are you off to ?
I want one like that .
This is not safe .
Tom saw Mary with John .
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
Tom is starting to feel a little better .
He &apos;s already a man .
What do we do about Tom ?
It was easy for me to do so .
She has many friends .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
Here you are .
Are you sure Tom did that ?
Tom is no longer living in Boston .
Tom has three kids .
It &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s another story .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
Don &apos;t you want me there ?
We &apos;ll wait here .
She &apos;s a dog .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s book .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
Where is Boston ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t come .
Do you want to see my room ?
I &apos;m coming right away .
Why is Tom not doing that ?
Tom and I both don &apos;t understand French at all .
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
Who else is going with us ?
There &apos;s a lot of traffic .
Tom is also from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
We &apos;re very worried about you .
I know his name .
Tom never forgot .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to go ?
Has something happened ?
I &apos;m still sleepy .
Tom goes to school with Mary .
That isn &apos;t safe .
You should know it .
I know something about it .
Tom asked for some water .
We &apos;re here to help .
Where are we now ?
When are you coming to Boston ?
I know you said that .
This is too easy for him .
I want to be happy again .
Tom needs you .
May I speak to you ?
I can &apos;t do it .
We know why you did it .
Tom won &apos;t listen .
Something needs to be done .
I &apos;m very , very happy .
Why don &apos;t you just forget it ?
Tom should &apos;ve been home from school hours ago .
It &apos;s very big .
What do they know that we don &apos;t ?
You &apos;re not here .
I think Tom is correct .
Can he do this job ?
What &apos;re you up to today ?
There was nobody here yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school here anymore .
Tom turned up three hours late .
I bought a book .
We &apos;ll help .
What did you do with my book ?
This makes me happy .
What &apos;s it going to be ?
I want you to leave my house .
My sister doesn &apos;t have a car .
The room has two windows .
You &apos;ll like this .
Tom won &apos;t have time to do that .
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
I want Tom to be happy .
You &apos;re back .
He &apos;s dating my sister .
I wrote this book .
Why are you still here ?
He can swim very fast .
I no longer love you .
We have no water .
I think I &apos;ve forgotten something .
Tom was finished .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a cat .
Tom and I have both been very busy .
I want to hear it from you .
Mary came up to me when she saw me .
I just need to know what happened .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
How about some coffee ?
Why are they doing that ?
We &apos;re getting better and better .
I have a lot of friends here .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
He is now almost as tall as his father is .
I want to know what this is .
I &apos;m really sorry .
You can say whatever you want .
I &apos;m not sure if I can do that .
Is your husband at home ?
I saw her only a week ago .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I &apos;d like some more water .
You may still do it if you want to .
I should not have said that .
I think he &apos;s right .
We have everything .
Where is Tom ?
I don &apos;t think everyone is here yet .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
How &apos;s Tom tonight ?
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s all true .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I do not have any money .
Where is your house ?
Let &apos;s go back to Australia .
Why do you have to go ?
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
May I go with you ?
Tom needs the money .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Aren &apos;t you scared , Tom ?
I can &apos;t believe I did that .
He needs the money .
I hope to see you .
You know this is a mistake .
Who are those children ?
Tom likes what he sees .
She &apos;s eating for two .
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is .
Tom is imitating the teacher .
I don &apos;t need a doctor .
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
We &apos;re not watching .
Tom will be proven right .
When did you find this ?
Why would I say anything ?
I think I &apos;d want to know .
I hope it &apos;s not too late .
What &apos;s wrong with yours ?
Is someone here ?
Did you see that ?
You should go .
Do you know what I want ?
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
I can &apos;t be without you .
I know that Tom is out .
I must get back to my work .
We have to do something , Tom .
How &apos;re they doing that ?
I don &apos;t like that woman .
Nobody here does that .
What do you know about that ?
I &apos;ll see you very soon .
Ask Tom to wait till I come .
Why are these people in here ?
If anyone can do it , you can .
What does your son do ?
I can &apos;t go with you .
Just tell me what happened .
We have to do that this week .
What do you have for me today ?
Are you with Tom ?
She is far from beautiful .
She didn &apos;t go yesterday .
Tom is not here .
I don &apos;t think Tom sees it that way .
It &apos;s all quite simple .
Tom lives with his parents .
Can I help you with that ?
I think what you need now is to eat something .
She has a book .
Why do I have to be here ?
I have no money to buy the book with .
I need to see it now .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
They never give up .
Tom is often late for work .
I can handle it .
I &apos;ve lost it .
Why do I have to give this to you ?
I have to go alone .
Tom should &apos;ve done it the way you told him to do it .
Tom isn &apos;t lost .
Tom is opening the window .
You have to let me help you .
Why aren &apos;t you at Tom &apos;s ?
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
They have very little to live on .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
I know where it is .
We have a long way to go .
She &apos;s forgotten how to do it .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak .
How long have you been in Boston ?
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
I &apos;m sure I saw her two years ago .
I &apos;ll take Tom home .
I have everything I want .
You can &apos;t always do what you want .
Tom could speak French .
He is my brother , not father .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Does Tom have a problem with that ?
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s going on .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Isn &apos;t that what I said ?
Isn &apos;t that what we were supposed to do ?
Tom couldn &apos;t talk .
He did it for money .
It &apos;s not too late to do that .
That is your book .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
Tom isn &apos;t a good father .
We &apos;re almost done .
We don &apos;t want to do that here .
I told Tom to do that .
Tom did a really nice job .
I want one !
You &apos;ve been very good to me .
How is the family ?
I still want to talk to you .
I &apos;m going to kill myself .
What kind of English is that ?
Is it large enough ?
I will have to study tomorrow .
What are they doing out there ?
They know what happened .
Tom arrived ahead of Mary .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
I don &apos;t know if Tom is dead or alive .
When did you go ?
I bought it for ten dollars .
I could help you with that .
I &apos;ll never do that again .
Where &apos;s Tom today ?
I &apos;ll read it .
We &apos;ll see .
You &apos;ll love this .
That &apos;s what Tom does .
We &apos;re like family .
Are you sure you really don &apos;t need anything ?
There &apos;s a car coming .
Has Tom returned ?
She might come .
Tom is too good for you .
I have never met a person like him .
Tom says he won &apos;t come .
You came too late .
I like coffee better .
Tom said that he was going to help .
That &apos;s better than nothing .
That &apos;s how we want you to do it .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
I can &apos;t give those to you .
Can you come ?
We want to help you .
I can &apos;t swim as well as Tom .
That girl looks like Mary .
She will come soon .
We see each other every day .
Who knows what you saw ?
What can I do for you this evening ?
Can you give that to Tom ?
How long does it take by car ?
How bad do you want it ?
What does Tom want Mary to do ?
Do you know how Tom is doing ?
Let &apos;s see what will happen .
Are your parents home ?
He speaks English .
Tom knows how to swim .
We &apos;re here for you .
Tom said that .
I need to get back home now .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here .
I don &apos;t know the truth .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
He must have seen it .
Tom wrote this book .
What do you want to learn ?
He said that he was happy .
I &apos;m happy with this .
I &apos;ve known Tom for a long time .
Tom didn &apos;t know how to help Mary .
She is no longer what she used to be .
Tom is Mary &apos;s son .
I always wanted a dog .
You need friends .
He &apos;s worried that he might be late .
Why are you still here ?
We &apos;ll consult Tom .
Tom is quite busy just now .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I knew there was nothing you could do about it .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t find a job .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
It is better for you to do it now .
Do you have children ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
Everybody likes him .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
This is the happiest I &apos;ve ever been .
She doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;m in school .
I guess Tom was right .
I think Tom was supposed to be here .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
Tom wanted to be a teacher .
I don &apos;t want to do that again .
We &apos;re nearly finished .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
Tom told me his father wasn &apos;t home .
Don &apos;t tell Tom .
We have to wait for him .
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
I should &apos;ve chosen the money .
They don &apos;t listen .
Tom and I &apos;ll go with Mary .
We know why .
That won &apos;t work .
Tom lost again .
Tom is good-looking .
I didn &apos;t do it for you .
I can eat anything .
What &apos;s Tom doing with that ?
I need some time alone .
Your father is tall .
You don &apos;t really want to remain here , do you ?
It was for Tom .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
He went to bed .
How &apos;s the family ?
She has been sick for a week .
I was really busy .
Tom speaks French well .
What do you want to watch ?
Leave out this word .
I still don &apos;t know yet .
What &apos;re you good at ?
Did Tom see that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come .
I know your father very well .
I said don &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s good to see you .
I &apos;m on my own .
Do you want Tom there ?
I want more .
This is what I have to do .
Who is that woman ?
Tom works there .
I wish Tom was here with me today .
My father works here .
I think I &apos;ll take it .
Regardless of what he does , he does it well .
They &apos;ll be afraid .
I have to take off .
Tom said that he was sleepy .
Tom &apos;s wasted .
We want to talk to you .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
I think Tom wants more .
Do you know it ?
I don &apos;t have time to help you right now .
Leave the book where it is .
She must be sick .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Let Tom do that .
The bus was two minutes early .
She is , if anything , a little better today than yesterday .
I would &apos;ve liked that .
This is not true .
Children should play outside .
Tom needs the money right away .
They &apos;re afraid of me .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
You are as tall as my sister .
Who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
How many kids do you have ?
You &apos;d better get going .
Why does Tom want to stay in Boston ?
Tom will do that again today .
We don &apos;t want you here .
Tom asked Mary where her mother was .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
They &apos;re gone .
Did you enjoy that ?
Tom can &apos;t swim .
Get off of Tom .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
I know something Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I &apos;d like to be like Tom .
They are both good teachers .
I need a doctor .
He got into bed .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
How did you make it ?
Tom &apos;s watching .
What &apos;s mine &apos;s yours .
Tom seems very happy .
You &apos;d better not go there .
We are happy .
How many other people are there ?
It doesn &apos;t matter much .
That doesn &apos;t happen very often .
I wrote it for Tom .
How sick is Tom ?
I know you don &apos;t have time to help us .
I didn &apos;t know Tom would be here today .
She can swim further than I can .
I &apos;ve had enough .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
I believe Tom is right .
I would like to go with you .
That is all right .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
What happened in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with Mary .
I still want to hear Tom &apos;s opinion .
That big one is also mine .
I &apos;m not alone .
I can &apos;t talk about it right now .
Tom works very hard , but not as hard as Mary .
When did Tom buy his car ?
I crossed the street .
Don &apos;t keep company with him .
This is all I can do .
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
This dog is big .
I have to go to Boston with Tom .
I wonder why I &apos;m so tired .
Tom wants to go with us .
Have you ever lost ?
You can &apos;t talk to Tom like that .
I think that Tom should do that .
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
I have no friend to talk with .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working here .
He may come today .
Who said that it would be easy ?
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
I want to talk to Tom .
I can &apos;t read this .
My father has been busy .
Say you &apos;re sorry .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
I can &apos;t go back to that house .
She has already finished the work .
Tom isn &apos;t certain about the answer .
I don &apos;t want Tom seeing this .
I don &apos;t have the time to help you right now .
Why do people say that ?
Tom has written a book .
Tom is going to do that .
We found it .
We know how they are .
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
She gave it to him .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed .
I hope that Tom can wait for us .
Do you want to leave it like that ?
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
You can &apos;t see me , can you ?
I am going to do it .
What more do you want ?
Nobody wants to talk about that .
I was in the house .
Tom hasn &apos;t written to Mary in a long time .
You were supposed to tell Tom that .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
We must do this right now .
Is that all you want to know ?
I wish I had been there with you .
I &apos;ve bought a car .
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
Do you want to live in Boston ?
He wondered why she did not come .
We know you &apos;re still there .
Nobody can understand it .
He did not have enough money .
Tom knows all about Mary .
I don &apos;t have a wife .
I wish I &apos;d kept up my French .
I wouldn &apos;t count on it .
Mary looks like her mother .
Everyone &apos;s going .
They &apos;re taking too long .
Thank you for coming .
Are you a doctor ?
Do you have any water ?
I think I &apos;m going to go home .
Why does Tom not like you ?
I think you &apos;ve done enough .
You won &apos;t get rid of me that easily .
When will you leave ?
You have to give me more time .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
Here , take this .
It &apos;s very white .
Did you really say that ?
It looks like Tom really enjoys doing that .
Is that your son ?
It &apos;s too big .
Is Tom out there ?
Tom will have to wait .
Tom can speak French and English .
Can I come ?
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tell Tom I don &apos;t like him .
I &apos;d like to be friends .
Tom is himself again .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what I want to do .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
Is this what Tom wants ?
Why don &apos;t you look for a job ?
That &apos;s hers .
Who are you ?
Have you seen her ?
We learn French at school .
That isn &apos;t French .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
We should probably go home .
Are we alone ?
I found you .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
She needs assistance .
This one &apos;s mine .
He knows that you know .
Tom seems to like speaking French .
Tom has a son .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t need to .
Tom won &apos;t listen to me .
I don ’ t know their names .
Is this what I think it is ?
We have everything we want .
I took the money .
Tom is going , too .
I &apos;m with him .
What does she do ?
Tom is going to tell the truth .
It is long way to the town .
Tom wants to help .
I &apos;m never going to leave you again .
Tom knew exactly where Mary was .
I don &apos;t know whether he &apos;ll come by train or by car .
I dislike being alone .
Tom told Mary he hadn &apos;t seen John in years .
Who &apos;s he ?
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to do that .
He needs it .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t either .
That &apos;s what we want , isn &apos;t it ?
Don &apos;t say a word .
Regardless what he does , he does it well .
This happens all the time .
Is this your cat ?
You &apos;re not telling the truth .
I know what to say .
Why did you go to Boston ?
Tom is telling the truth .
How &apos;s that again ?
We speak French .
Is French hard to learn ?
Tom never showed up .
I think I know why you &apos;re here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can swim or not .
I checked outside .
I know what I will do .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
Tom has done a lot for Mary .
No one was at home .
Is Tom alone ?
Do you like to be alone ?
I stay home alone while my parents are at work .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
We have made friends with Tom .
You can wait here .
I &apos;m going to make you happy .
Why &apos;d you do that ?
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
I &apos;m not sure how that happened .
Tom and Mary want us to do that .
I don &apos;t have a family .
May I ask you a question ?
I &apos;d like to learn French .
I know where you can find Tom .
I love her so much that I can &apos;t leave her .
He was ill , but today he &apos;s all right .
I &apos;m happy with it .
What do you want for that ?
It was rather easy for them .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom yourself ?
Tom hasn &apos;t done what he was supposed to do .
I &apos;m so happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that yet .
I &apos;ll be ready in a jiffy .
There &apos;s more .
Where is Father ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
You must go to school .
I just don &apos;t know what to say .
It &apos;s always been like that .
Tom is in the room .
She makes me happy .
Speaking French is difficult .
Tom has been single all his life .
Tom seems to be sick .
Tom is worried about me .
All those things are true .
That boy looks like you .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
That car is hers .
I think you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom and Mary will be going home soon .
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
The man asked me for some money .
I haven &apos;t found it yet .
I can &apos;t understand that word .
I knew it .
We both know it &apos;s too late .
I can &apos;t read .
I &apos;d like to see it .
Is this it ?
What are you implying ?
I just have one question for you .
I don &apos;t know what I should do .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to find me .
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
We &apos;ll do it this way from now on .
That looks good .
Tom &apos;s my friend .
What &apos;re you going to do ?
That &apos;s what Tom keeps telling me .
Tom has just told me that he found a new job .
I wish I could come with you .
Tom could do it .
We know who you are .
How does it look ?
What have you been doing all week ?
I should have taken the money .
This book isn &apos;t very good .
We &apos;ll talk later .
How long do you think we &apos;ll have to wait ?
I wish Tom was here .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wondered how long he &apos;d have to wait for Mary .
I think I &apos;m likeable .
That isn &apos;t enough .
You can wait outside .
I want to talk to the police .
That &apos;s what I saw .
I need to go back to Boston .
I wonder how Tom does that .
It is time to go to school .
I had nothing to say .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston .
They &apos;re Tom and Mary .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn &apos;t help him .
He didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Our money ran out .
I &apos;ll write a letter to Tom .
Are those yours ?
I loved it in Boston .
I do hope so .
Tom won &apos;t have to wait very long .
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
I have an opinion .
I need you to drive me to the station .
Did you say something ?
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom anything .
What &apos;s Tom still doing here ?
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I might be a few minutes late .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school anymore .
I don &apos;t know where I am .
Tom barely speaks to me anymore .
Tom speaks French better than he pretends to .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t know French .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom is .
I own this car .
I didn &apos;t buy anything for Tom .
It looks like Tom is afraid .
I &apos;ll find something .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom . I can &apos;t do it .
I know you &apos;re happy .
Maybe we should talk .
Can you stay a bit longer ?
Tom is old .
Tom does everything he &apos;s told .
You &apos;ve got time right now , don &apos;t you ?
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Did you make this yourself ?
Tom isn &apos;t like you .
He &apos;s working on it .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
Tom should &apos;ve listened to you .
Here you are , Tom .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed home .
Tom couldn &apos;t find it .
Do you wish to go ?
You have to speak French here .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
Tom should have done it the way Mary told him to do it .
You &apos;re as beautiful as ever .
I don &apos;t love you .
It looks like Tom likes his new job .
Tom likes it there .
Tom said he didn &apos;t see anything .
When will we go back ?
I am sorry for you .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
I &apos;m one of you .
What are you wearing ?
It &apos;s a good question .
How does Tom do this ?
I want Tom to come home .
I know how to do that .
Tom wants to do that , too .
That isn &apos;t it .
Who is your friend ?
You can count on me .
Tom asked me for money .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
It &apos;s got to be now .
I have a wife and family .
Why is Tom going to Boston ?
He is likely to come .
They will understand .
Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning .
Is all this money yours ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
This is what I like about you .
I &apos;m going to need more help .
I &apos;m not you .
Tom has never been late for school .
I wanted to read a book .
How does Tom come to school ?
How do you like Australia ?
How long do we have to wait here ?
This clock gains two minutes a day .
I don &apos;t need your help .
This is for you .
I didn &apos;t go .
I &apos;m not sure why .
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom wants Mary .
I know the truth .
Nobody wants to be around Tom .
Why do I have to go ?
Tell Tom what &apos;s wrong .
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
Where does Tom work ?
I think you know what I think .
How long is that story ?
I &apos;ve seen enough .
Tom says he &apos;s too tired today to help us .
It can &apos;t be true .
You aren &apos;t happy , are you ?
It &apos;s all mine .
Tom has more money than I do .
I won &apos;t forget that .
I plan to speak with Tom about that .
Tom said he &apos;d come tomorrow .
What did you do with them ?
Tom really wants to help .
That &apos;s the one .
How often do you work here ?
You need to tell me the truth .
Tom has lots of things he has to do .
How old is your cat ?
You shouldn &apos;t go to school .
Tom isn &apos;t talking to me .
I can &apos;t believe it !
There was a cat on the table .
Tom &apos;s French is hard to understand .
I was worried about you all day .
Is your mother at home ?
What did Tom say about me ?
Tom &apos;s not home yet .
Do you like to be alone ?
More needs to be done .
That will do .
Children need to play .
I will wait here till he comes .
We need the money .
That &apos;s all we know .
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
As far as I know , they are still together .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
I just have a few questions for you .
Your French is very good .
I don &apos;t remember who gave this to me .
Give me something to eat .
I can &apos;t go , nor do I want to .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell Tom .
Can you speak French ?
Why don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
I didn &apos;t hear what you said .
I was not feeling well .
You could do better .
Where is her family ?
I like my school .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
I was not a good mother .
My children can &apos;t speak French .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t alone .
Tom should have told Mary the truth .
This was all a mistake .
It just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
I go to school because I want to learn .
I wish that had never happened .
I want to stay for a few days .
I know Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
I will get it for you .
I &apos;ll do this .
Is that book for me ?
I &apos;ve never wanted to be anything else but a teacher .
I thought he wouldn &apos;t come .
Don &apos;t feel sorry for Tom .
Did Tom tell you ?
Tom turned white .
You can &apos;t scare me .
Tom has one , too .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;ll live .
I need to know where you are .
If Tom can &apos;t tell me , then no one can .
We need something to eat .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
He &apos;s too old .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom .
Tom quit school .
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
Tom would like to have a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
Tom said Mary wouldn &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents ?
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
Tom does that , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
I &apos;d rather not eat right now .
What happened to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with me .
You &apos;re my woman .
There is no answer to your question .
Tom and Mary are waiting outside .
It &apos;s nice to see Tom so happy .
It keeps happening .
You must eat something .
May I go home now ?
What time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
Tom isn &apos;t like that .
I don &apos;t love her .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us either .
Tom seems busy .
How did Tom find us ?
You didn &apos;t come to school yesterday , did you ?
I made you coffee .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
No one knew the answer .
I &apos;ve said what I had to say .
Why are these people here ?
Tom has to go with Mary .
I &apos;d like your opinion on this .
You should &apos;ve come yesterday .
Are we just friends ?
How are you going to help Tom ?
I don &apos;t think of it like that .
I think Tom understands that if he wants my help , all he needs to do is ask for it .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
It made Tom happy .
He asked for money .
I have a lot to do today .
Tom and I have worked together for over three years .
I know your name .
No one had an answer .
He said that if he were there , he would help her .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary &apos;s father was .
When did you buy that ?
Did Tom say why he was here ?
All you have to do is give him a little help .
I made that .
She likes all of us .
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
He lives on this street .
I &apos;d like to go , too .
Are you still busy ?
Please tell me what this is .
I can &apos;t remember who I am .
Tom never came home .
I knew it .
Tom and Mary both can &apos;t swim .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that with you .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom will be along soon .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
Tom can come .
Tom wasn &apos;t sick .
I need more money .
I think you can help us .
Who could forget it ?
We &apos;re just good friends .
How much time do we have ?
Tom isn &apos;t like his brother .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom said that he feels good .
I &apos;ll be your teacher .
Let Tom go .
We still have to do that .
Tom is here with us .
Tom had no idea Mary was sick .
I don &apos;t want to know about it .
I hope we &apos;ll be seeing you around here soon .
Tom asked Mary to stay where she was .
It can &apos;t be helped .
Are you free tomorrow ?
I looked in the window .
Can you even speak French ?
You need to learn French .
We can still talk to Tom .
I want to do it myself .
Why do I have to talk to Tom ?
Have you heard from him ?
She &apos;s very beautiful .
They have families .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
He doesn &apos;t live there anymore .
I want to write a book .
I went to school there .
He has a big family .
Tom is doing fine .
Did Tom give you that ?
Where are you taking Tom ?
What should I tell Tom now ?
I don &apos;t want to take your money .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s brother .
I heard you last night , Tom .
I wrote the book .
I could not understand anything he said .
Haven &apos;t we met before ?
I have to get that .
I don &apos;t like the house he lives in .
Tom said he &apos;d be there .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
You &apos;ll need more .
What &apos;s going on with you ?
He was not happy at all .
Tom wants to become a doctor .
I &apos;ve already been here two hours .
Tom had fun with it .
Where &apos;s the boy ?
We know who you are .
I think Tom is in Boston .
I &apos;m nothing like you .
I &apos;m very scared .
Tom asked for our help .
I &apos;m going to stay home today and read a book .
Tom and Mary have come .
You &apos;re back .
I wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
That is all that he said .
You don &apos;t need to do that if you don &apos;t want to .
I don &apos;t need that .
Tom knew everything .
Can I speak to the doctor ?
I hope that she &apos;ll get well soon .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak a word of French .
Are you planning on buying a house ?
Who did it ?
Tom told Mary that he was busy .
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
If I had time , I would study French .
I want to speak with Tom .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
Why do you want to talk to me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I know .
I know what you want .
Give that back to me .
That &apos;s all you need .
We &apos;ll help you .
I &apos;d love to get one of those .
I &apos;ve got no time for that .
He seems ill .
Where can we meet you ?
I haven &apos;t forgotten Tom .
I saw Tom do that .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
That boy is his brother .
Tom left Mary in the room by herself .
How can you not like this ?
He has not seen much of the world .
I met him while he was in Japan .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is staying .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
My mother gets up early every morning .
Well , how did that happen anyway ?
Tom has all day to get that done .
I can &apos;t stay here anymore .
There &apos;s your friend .
I &apos;m tired of Boston .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
Why are people here ?
What am I going to say to Tom ?
What does Tom really want ?
Did Tom tell you what to do ?
That &apos;s Tom .
Are you sure they can do this ?
Tom and Mary are here .
Tom knew that he &apos;d have to tell Mary the truth .
I used to be like you .
It won &apos;t help you .
I want us to be together .
I &apos;m not going to go .
We &apos;re just friends ?
Why is your French so good ?
I want to give this to Tom .
I suppose I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
You &apos;re good at this .
I don &apos;t think Tom has enough money to buy that .
Tom got scared .
Tom has to go to work .
Tom and Mary are in the car waiting for us .
She wished to be beautiful .
You know what I want .
Tom says he &apos;ll come .
Tom wished he had something to do .
Aren &apos;t you happy here ?
I &apos;d like to hear what your opinion is .
Tom has a little money .
We did that just for fun .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
I don &apos;t like people like Tom .
Why is Tom leaving school ?
We want to talk to Tom .
It isn &apos;t difficult to speak French .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
May I go with Tom ?
I knew Tom had something to do with it .
Do you think English is difficult ?
I think I know you .
Where are they taking you ?
I hope that you will like it .
Tom wants you .
Do you know if Tom is here ?
I had no idea that Tom knew how to speak French .
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
We know all that .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
We are his children .
I am not sure .
I had a good opinion of her .
You &apos;re better than me .
Let &apos;s buy this one .
I don &apos;t even have time to read .
I think he doesn &apos;t like it here .
My mother is out .
We don &apos;t need you .
The kids are at school .
Tom will arrive in Boston tomorrow morning .
How did you make it ?
I have a boyfriend back home .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to be happy ?
I never liked going to school .
What do you have for me today ?
I can speak French better than Tom .
Tom may not be doing that .
Nobody came to work this morning .
She needs you .
I thought Tom had already gone home .
Why don &apos;t we take it with us ?
Can you stop it ?
I received her letter last week .
Tom wants to have a talk with Mary .
They say it &apos;s very good .
Do you have a son ?
Tom gave his dog something to eat .
Are we done yet ?
I don &apos;t like the coffee .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to stay at home .
I &apos;m better .
I know Tom likes me .
I could have done it without your help .
Tom is there , isn &apos;t he ?
I wanted to learn French .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
We know where it is .
Tom doesn &apos;t like girls like Mary .
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom .
I do love you .
Let Tom go .
Tom won &apos;t go away .
I &apos;m rather busy .
I &apos;m in Boston all this week .
I &apos;d like to be able to tell Tom that he has nothing to worry about .
We were in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t go home yesterday .
Nobody &apos;s happy .
I have it with me .
I &apos;m no good for you .
Tom is afraid to tell the truth .
Why are they doing this ?
Nobody was home .
He didn &apos;t show up .
I can &apos;t even do that .
I &apos;ll help as much as I can .
It &apos;s this book .
I know only this .
We &apos;ll find Tom .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sister .
I want to see my brother .
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
That &apos;s not easy .
I don &apos;t want to know about this .
Tom is standing .
I can &apos;t live with you anymore .
Do you have any questions ?
Tom pretended not to understand French .
My mother worries about everything .
Why is it here ?
I &apos;m not going with you .
Perhaps Tom would enjoy doing that .
I hope to see you .
Is your mother at home ?
I &apos;m game .
Tom could do it .
Tom could hardly believe him .
I must buy one .
That &apos;s simple .
This should be more than enough .
Nobody can help you .
Don &apos;t say it like that .
She might come tomorrow .
Who is standing there ?
I have to know .
I want to know how .
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
Tom looks happy .
What &apos;s your location ?
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
Tom could see Mary .
You can &apos;t trust anything he says .
All you have to do is to wait for her reply .
Tom wasn &apos;t joking .
Tom was with me all day .
Tom has never been so happy .
How is your family ?
He left immediately .
This room is not very large .
Tom is nothing but a child .
Please , tell me .
They &apos;ll be back soon .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
That &apos;s just the way things were back then .
Do you want to see the house ?
Where are our children ?
This is a very busy station .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
Everyone knows .
I can do it now .
Who wants it ?
I figured you should know .
You don &apos;t have to go .
He came to Japan when he was 10 years old .
Let me see that .
Tom is going to Boston with me .
He is always happy .
Tom has something in his hand .
They wear very little clothing .
Is this your bike ?
Tom has been sick for a very long time .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
He will be back in a second .
We are a family .
The dog went away .
We know what Tom and Mary want .
It &apos;s five o &apos;clock .
What &apos;s Tom saying ?
I can read them all .
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this one bit .
We know everything you know .
We &apos;re coming .
They can &apos;t see you .
You &apos;re very busy .
I &apos;ll come back later .
Tom is quite likely to be late .
Where &apos;s your friend ?
You can have this .
Did you get something to eat ?
There &apos;s a lot of work to do .
That &apos;s exactly what he wanted .
I know each one of you .
I &apos;m taking off .
I have enough money .
Why did Tom do this ?
They had had that problem before .
If only I could drive a car .
Tom is walking .
Thanks for helping .
It &apos;s out of the question !
Tom saw nothing .
I must learn French .
I wrote a letter .
Tom looked quite tired .
We &apos;re getting it .
You &apos;re the one I love .
Tom may be out .
I know that was a mistake .
I &apos;m as old as Tom is .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
We only have one year to get this done .
Tom ate quickly .
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ?
They &apos;re back .
Tom also saw it .
If you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll ask someone else to help me .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car yet .
People don &apos;t say that anymore .
Tom did it for his family .
Tom will never understand .
Do you really want to know ?
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
I just didn &apos;t know what to do .
You &apos;d better take this .
What do you need ?
No one will believe you .
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
Why are we here ?
I love you just as you are .
Why are you busy today ?
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
I knew something Tom didn &apos;t know .
He cannot have been there yesterday .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
I still don &apos;t see it .
That &apos;s very , very good .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom looks like you .
That looks good on you .
Tom &apos;s not in his car .
You should have one of us do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything .
That &apos;s where Tom is .
Tom could do that .
I can &apos;t tell you that yet .
I am sure .
Did you like Boston ?
I asked Tom to come .
They are both good .
It has nothing to do with you .
Do you know where we are ?
You &apos;re afraid of him .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s boyfriend anymore .
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
How &apos;ve you been keeping ?
Tom is seriously ill .
Are you really a doctor ?
Let me do that for you .
I can wait .
I &apos;ll be taking the car .
Are you busy these days ?
I have something to tell you .
Don &apos;t give me that .
I was busy yesterday .
How does Tom get to school ?
How big is Tom &apos;s house ?
He was sick , but he went to school .
I don &apos;t think he will come .
Do you want to go home now ?
I &apos;m still thinking about it .
We have until tomorrow morning .
Tom went outside .
Tom arrived early .
This is for you , Tom .
Have you seen this man ?
Did you like that ?
Why would Tom want to help us ?
I &apos;m better than him .
They won &apos;t find Tom there .
Tom said he was going to Australia .
Tom was planning on doing that tomorrow .
Hand it to Tom .
I want to know what that is .
Speaking French is a lot of fun .
The cat is on the table .
We have enough water .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
I love you more than you love me .
This is my city now .
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
What &apos;s that look like to you ?
She went home .
That is no business of his .
I think I can do it .
This is big .
Tom and Mary are still there .
Tom just left .
Can you read French ?
It &apos;s my money .
Do you know who he was ?
Perhaps you &apos;d better drive .
You &apos;ll learn how to do it sooner or later .
I can &apos;t forget Tom .
She was there in the morning .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary right now .
I &apos;m not going to read it .
It is time for her to go home .
When will you finish your work ?
Tom &apos;ll wait .
I think we should do it .
He won &apos;t be away for long .
Tom went back to the table .
Have him come .
Can I eat in my room ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever been this busy .
This is how I did it .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
He proceeded to the next question .
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
Do you know how to do it ?
Why does Tom do it ?
I am better .
Tom will understand .
I don &apos;t know this road .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why he &apos;s here .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m going to take you to Tom .
I want that more than anything .
Tom was at home alone .
You should leave at once .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be able to find it .
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
I know who you are .
You have to tell me the truth .
I said I &apos;d go .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary the whole truth .
He had more than enough money .
This is too big .
I can &apos;t even help myself .
Children like playing more than studying .
Tom came with me .
Tom and Mary want to know what &apos;s going on .
He isn &apos;t happy at all .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I wanted to give Tom some money .
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
I &apos;ll be in Boston .
That &apos;s a table .
Don &apos;t say things like that .
I was just going to leave home .
We have a problem .
How did Tom do this ?
I couldn &apos;t hear Tom .
Why do you want to help the police ?
Everyone is talking about Tom .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
I really don &apos;t want to live here .
Both of you are right .
I didn &apos;t know you could do this .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
I am still alone .
I &apos;ll give you money .
No one here has a car .
I know Tom pretty well .
You can come .
I believe that the story is true .
He may have said so .
It &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
Tom came to Boston with me .
I like school .
I saw Tom do that .
We &apos;ll stay here .
I will do anything for him .
I can &apos;t give it to Tom .
Tom is like Mary .
I don &apos;t like this .
Tom didn &apos;t really enjoy studying French .
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
He was busy .
Tom says that he &apos;s tired .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary in years .
Tom can &apos;t buy a car .
We &apos;ve got to go .
He bought it for five dollars .
Did Tom come ?
Tom bought Mary a dog .
You have to help us .
Tom , we have a problem .
I don &apos;t want to do his work for him .
Why do you like Boston ?
He doesn &apos;t care about money .
Tom can read .
Why don &apos;t you believe me ?
That &apos;s what I like .
He is getting old .
We have no school tomorrow .
Tom , can you come tomorrow ?
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
I would &apos;ve done anything .
Tom can speak French much better than me .
I want this .
I really don &apos;t think I can do that .
I &apos;m about to take Tom home .
I have something to ask of you .
He didn &apos;t have enough money to ride home on the train .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
That &apos;s enough for today . I &apos;m tired .
Do I look presentable ?
I will not let you do it .
Tom hasn &apos;t done anything .
I knew you &apos;d be here .
Tom knows this isn &apos;t good .
Tom likes girls .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
She has more books .
My brother is now in Australia .
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
I no longer need them .
Thank you for today .
We don &apos;t have to do this .
The dog is white .
He is opening the window .
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
Here I come .
Tom is coming with me to Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
I know he is busy .
Tell me what I should &apos;ve done .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary likes him or not .
Tom will like that .
I know that Tom is from Boston .
I would like to help you .
Do you have a dog ?
Tom needs us .
I &apos;m your age .
Are you with us ?
That day shall come .
Is there anything I can do for you ?
Why can Tom speak French so well ?
I don &apos;t want your money .
She asked how his father was .
I must say something .
There was food enough for us all .
You should have told it to me sooner .
You should go home now .
Can you give me this one , please ?
We want to help you .
I like being in Boston .
What makes us human ?
I will be back soon .
He said that he didn &apos;t know .
Tom speaks French better than I do .
What can you tell me about this ?
What do you mean by it ?
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
I must have made a mistake .
There &apos;s still time .
They know who they are .
Tom isn &apos;t as busy as he seems to be .
Tom kept Mary waiting .
Tom wants me to be his girlfriend .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t hear you .
I lost everything I had .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
I &apos;ve always liked the outdoors .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
Thanks for doing this .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
Have you forgotten everything we &apos;ve done for you ?
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
What are you sorry about ?
Are you as tall as me ?
Tom has done that .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
Tom looks happy today .
There &apos;s no need to go to school today .
It &apos;s better that way .
You missed .
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
You can go or stay , as you wish .
Tom says he needs my help tomorrow .
You have to tell me the truth .
When did you buy this car ?
I expect that Tom will do more .
Please don &apos;t use French .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
I like your family .
This is all the money that I have now .
Why can &apos;t we just be friends ?
It is something my mother made .
I didn &apos;t mean that to happen .
I couldn &apos;t believe what I was seeing .
He says he won &apos;t come .
I think this is mine .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Don &apos;t tell her about it .
I only hope that that &apos;s enough .
I was just here yesterday .
Tom has friends .
I &apos;ve got to get dressed for school .
I had to stay home .
What should I have done ?
Tom speaks French very well .
Tom is too old to be living on his own .
It &apos;s already too late .
Tom is scared .
Tom is a very good teacher .
I thought doing this would be easy .
Doing this makes me happy .
Tom works for Mary .
Tom likes to do that .
Is this all we need ?
I &apos;m coming back home by bus .
We can get what we want without your help .
Tom will be here for three days .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
I saw nothing at all .
My parents are in Australia .
Tom said to give you this .
Do you know where ?
What &apos;ll you do there ?
Tom is going to tell Mary he &apos;s sorry .
Tom was home .
Did you hear something ?
Give Tom what he wants .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
Let me know when you &apos;ll be ready .
We &apos;ll help you out .
Give Tom what he needs .
We &apos;re doing what we have to do .
Who are they ?
I don &apos;t think he knows I love you .
I thought as much .
Where &apos;s your dog ?
I don &apos;t know where it is .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
I was worried about you all day .
Who saw you ?
I don &apos;t need your money . What I need is your time .
Tom would know .
Tom was at home .
I want to keep my car there .
We &apos;ve got plenty of time .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Do you know anything about Tom &apos;s parents ?
You are really very good .
You might be right .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done any better .
Why did you guys leave ?
I know everybody here .
Tom didn &apos;t even know that Mary was gone .
Tom seems to like studying French .
I am not busy now .
Say please .
Tom wants a watch like yours .
Tom stopped talking .
Ask him his name .
Tom will go as well .
What you did made Tom happy .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about it .
He &apos;s a man now .
Can you read that ?
I &apos;m at school .
I &apos;ve been very busy since this morning .
What &apos;re we doing here ?
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
You should have come to us .
We no longer need you .
What makes you so sure Tom wants to stay ?
There is nothing here .
He should come right away !
He asked for the money .
They don &apos;t want Tom there .
We do almost everything together .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why .
What do you want to do now ?
Tom is doing everything he can to help .
Tom has been pretending to be me .
Tom speaks fairly quickly .
When is school out ?
Tom simply wasn &apos;t quick enough .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s saying .
Tom looked like a doctor .
This story cannot be true .
What are you people doing ?
What do you know about him ?
Isn &apos;t Tom afraid ?
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
Do you have any more of these ?
I am able to read English .
You &apos;re good at French , aren &apos;t you ?
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
I know who it was .
Do you know what I mean ?
We don &apos;t have that kind of money .
Tom was one of us .
I think Tom has never been to Boston .
That is his house .
What are you still doing here ?
If you don &apos;t want to talk to me , you don &apos;t have to .
How old are your children now ?
You should ask Tom first .
I hope that you will like it .
She doesn &apos;t speak English .
Mary is not my sister .
Do you want to end up like Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he is .
I never did that .
Tom is sure .
Let &apos;s not discuss this now .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy here .
I love my father .
I know you know this .
Tom already ate .
Tom will know what this is .
He is getting better day by day .
Tom isn &apos;t certain .
You are old enough to know this .
There &apos;s enough food to go round .
I have one in the car .
Why are you avoiding me ?
I want what Tom has .
What am I going to do , Tom ?
I think I &apos;ll go home .
Tom is just like you .
It isn &apos;t here anymore .
I should learn French .
Tom is about to leave .
She had a little money .
Is it too big ?
I know that she doesn &apos;t know who I am .
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
You &apos;re going to be fine .
What are we going to do about Tom ?
I did that already .
Is Tom back yet ?
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
I really need to talk to you .
Don &apos;t give in .
We &apos;re both from Boston .
Your family needs you .
You &apos;ve done it !
I want to go to Boston with you .
Tom is doing that for Mary .
I can take the train .
Tom isn &apos;t home yet .
Leave it there .
How did you like it ?
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
That &apos;s a lot !
Tom will be here soon .
He doesn &apos;t have to know .
I don &apos;t think we need that .
Speaking in French is fun .
I have a boyfriend .
Give it to me , please .
My mother is always busy .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
This is the boy I met there yesterday .
Tom has told me I need to do that .
We aren &apos;t going to do that .
I &apos;ll be back in two hours .
The door opened .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
I had a dog when I was a kid .
It &apos;s not going to be like that .
This might not be enough .
How big is your house ?
Are you really sick ?
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go .
I know what &apos;s good for you .
Can she come , too ?
Please don &apos;t let go of my hand .
Did you forget ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom was a doctor .
You &apos;re not welcome here .
Who gave that to you ?
Who knows what you saw ?
What are they doing here ?
Is that boy Tom ?
Tom can &apos;t do this as well as I can .
Nobody came to my rescue .
That &apos;s all I have to say .
I &apos;m doing well .
I think there &apos;s someone out there .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
Where did you find these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what time it is .
He begged us to go with him .
Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
We need Tom .
He has been in Japan for two years .
I know Tom is old .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom is gone .
You are very beautiful .
Tom is leaving .
I have seen that girl before .
I want to take Tom home .
We will be happy to help .
Tom is going to love it here .
That doesn &apos;t belong in here .
Tom and I are happy .
Can you speak French ?
You don &apos;t want to do that , do you ?
We hardly ever agree on anything .
Where is the bus ?
Tom went away .
I &apos;d like to be alone .
We need to know whether it &apos;s true or not .
I don &apos;t speak French and neither does Tom .
I like this .
I just don &apos;t know why .
They don &apos;t listen .
I want to get to know you .
It &apos;s good that you &apos;re here .
It &apos;s right over here .
Can &apos;t you help us ?
Tom had Mary do that .
I need Tom now .
How long is too long ?
We &apos;re not getting anywhere .
I &apos;d rather not know .
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want that .
If you aren &apos;t there by 10 : 00 , we &apos;ll leave without you .
She said that she was ill .
I went to the doctor .
What does it look like ?
That &apos;s what we saw .
Tom has gone to Boston .
I &apos;ll wait outside .
It &apos;s really very easy to do that .
You must work .
You &apos;re three hours late .
Tom knew there was no point in talking to Mary .
We are all happy to help .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t early .
This must be the place .
You &apos;ll be very happy here .
I don &apos;t want to be with you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I want .
She was alone in the house .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
I can &apos;t leave now .
Tom gave me several books .
I &apos;m not going to say that .
It was three years ago .
Did Tom go home ?
We &apos;re getting tired .
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
I don &apos;t know whether to believe him or not .
We haven &apos;t seen each other for such a long time .
Tom gave us lots to eat .
I want to see Tom again .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d seen John .
You &apos;ll never guess what Tom did .
I don &apos;t want to talk .
I don &apos;t think that Tom is happy .
I know Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a car .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
I don &apos;t have a car .
How is your family ?
I &apos;m not so sure .
It &apos;s been fun .
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
I know all their names .
Tom has to be home .
I just got here yesterday .
You &apos;d better go home .
I think I &apos;m going to go now .
There &apos;s nothing more to say .
What are we doing out here ?
I &apos;ve made the same mistake myself .
You &apos;ll have to come tomorrow .
Never in my life have I heard or seen such a thing .
That &apos;s no good .
I wish I had been there with you .
That &apos;s all for today .
Tom has bought a house in Boston .
He doesn &apos;t want kids .
You &apos;re right , I think .
Tom did it himself .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
Do you know what it says ?
He &apos;ll become a father soon .
She &apos;s not here .
Do you know anything ?
Did you get her letter ?
Who was it that gave that to you ?
How &apos;s it going with your family ?
Can your mother drive a car ?
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
It no longer matters .
How can I forget it ?
Tom won &apos;t be able to do that that soon .
When was the last time you went to Boston ?
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s house .
I don &apos;t want to go , and besides it &apos;s too late .
I don &apos;t like this .
Can I see , too ?
Both Tom and Mary are very frightened .
Do you know whether Tom can speak French ?
I would rather not talk about it .
I know exactly where I am .
Tom and Mary have everything they need .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it .
Tom says he &apos;ll come at once .
Tom worries too much .
What did you tell Tom ?
I hope so , too .
Is Tom there , too ?
Do you want to know why I &apos;m here ?
Tom knows what he wants to say .
The book &apos;s white .
Is this your room ?
I didn &apos;t want that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s true or not .
We learn to read and write in school .
She wants him .
You drive too fast .
Tom &apos;s here .
I &apos;m not a child anymore .
What have we got here ?
We &apos;ll stop here for today .
I want them all .
Tom will never have to worry about money .
There &apos;s got to be a way .
No one could tell where she was .
There &apos;s so much left for me to learn .
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened .
I can &apos;t do it anymore .
I don &apos;t ever want to leave this room .
Tom looked at his dog and his dog looked at him .
I &apos;m a good boy .
Tom said he knew you .
You should eat .
We work together .
Thank you for telling me .
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
I wish you had let Tom go with us .
We &apos;re not going to do it .
I just want you to know that Tom is safe .
I really don &apos;t want to do that .
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
Tom is still alive .
I &apos;ll assist in any way I can .
You can have as many as you want .
May I go to bed ?
I &apos;ll be fine here .
Never have I seen such a thing .
Are those guys from your school ?
I &apos;ve already told Tom what needs to be done .
Are you at Tom &apos;s place ?
Where &apos;s your mom ?
I have more than one friend who can &apos;t swim .
Tom might be early .
I &apos;d like to know why you &apos;re here .
I &apos;d love to see you .
I just want to be your friend , nothing more .
I believe you can help us .
Tom is here .
You can read this book .
We can count on Tom .
It isn &apos;t hard to do .
They found each other .
You should leave .
I wonder how long it &apos;s going to take .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in years .
No one tells me what to do .
I think your letter is under that book .
You don &apos;t speak English , do you ?
No one seems to listen to us anymore .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;m sorry I cannot go with you .
I love you more than anyone else .
Tom won &apos;t be here until later .
I think I &apos;d better stay here .
Thank you for that .
What Tom said wasn &apos;t true .
Tom asked me what I needed .
You are everything to me .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that , is he ?
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
Tom makes his own bed every morning .
This is the problem .
I have one of those , too .
You &apos;re very helpful .
Can &apos;t we just go home ?
I didn &apos;t forget you .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything to do with Mary .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s family .
I &apos;m tired .
It &apos;s too large .
I want to stay in Boston for a few more days .
We need more time .
We &apos;re busy .
I know Tom has gone to Boston .
I &apos;ll wait for a week .
I haven &apos;t done that yet .
I found the money .
I &apos;ve known that a long time .
I know who he is .
What really happened ?
Almost all of us can speak French .
I hope to see you tomorrow .
You know something , don &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s that boy ?
I &apos;m not Tom .
Tom likes doing that here .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
Tom gave it to us .
They won &apos;t come until tomorrow .
Do you have it with you ?
That &apos;s my fault .
I wish I could help you find a good job .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When do you need it ?
It &apos;s no longer available .
I was in favor of going and they were in favor of staying .
I could do it again .
There &apos;s something on the table .
I think Tom is looking at us .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
I &apos;m going to need some help .
Tom is at home , isn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like it .
You can &apos;t just go .
I wish Tom would learn to speak French .
If you don &apos;t want to stay , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom says he &apos;s doing that .
It is really quite a good story .
I guess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
He is no longer living here .
Tom wasn &apos;t listening .
I have no money on me .
We can &apos;t let Tom out of our sight .
Tom wanted to meet you .
Tom did everything for Mary .
I don &apos;t like your girlfriend .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary about John .
I &apos;ll be there in a couple of hours .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston , too ?
Tom , how &apos;s it going ?
Doing that was really easy .
I know what you mean .
Tom cannot drive .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I said that .
I need to speak with you right away .
Tom is in his room .
Tom never talks to Mary anymore .
Didn &apos;t you write a letter to him ?
There is much more to be done .
What are you eating ?
How tall you are !
I feel very sorry about that .
We know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
Do you have a car ?
You can say what you like .
What needs to be done ?
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
Maybe it &apos;s not too late .
I have a lot of things to do .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I would &apos;ve let Tom do it .
I don &apos;t know anything about him at all .
Tom wants to know your name .
I can &apos;t help you unless you tell me the truth .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Tom can &apos;t read French .
I know everything I need to know .
This is just what I wanted .
I want you to want me .
It is no use crying over spilt milk .
This book was written by Tom .
Where does she live now ?
It was your mistake , not mine .
Tom took the money off the table .
Tom is happy here .
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
Do you remember what Tom said ?
He is not a doctor .
I now know why Tom did what he did .
No one was to be seen on the street .
What does Tom see in you ?
Tom is not coming .
They were busy .
Can you swim at all ?
Are you planning to stay ?
I want my money returned immediately .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always been .
They are busy .
Tom isn &apos;t finished doing that .
Tom says he &apos;s always wanted to study French .
I think that we can do that .
I &apos;ll go wherever you want me to go .
Thanks for dropping by .
You &apos;ll do fine .
I love everything about you .
I know why you aren &apos;t happy here .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me .
You &apos;re a good man .
How have you been keeping ?
I &apos;d like to know what happened to Tom .
I know how busy Tom is .
How many days are there in a week ?
I can &apos;t believe you actually said that .
I told her what to do .
Even Tom knows that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened .
I &apos;m really sorry about Tom .
It &apos;s there .
Give that to me , please .
I think he is planning something .
Are you busy now ?
It &apos;s your book .
My friend has arrived .
You can rely on her .
That is exactly what I wanted to buy .
Who is she ?
I love Tom so much .
I &apos;ll see you around .
I &apos;m dining out this evening .
I have just finished eating .
Tom has a lot of money , but he &apos;s not happy .
I thought Tom would be in his room .
He wants to talk to you .
Nobody &apos;s there .
I &apos;m in Boston for a whole week .
Tom left .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
I wish that were true .
I &apos;ll probably never do that again .
What is it that you want to know ?
Where is your school ?
I want to be like Tom .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Don &apos;t you want me to be happy ?
My dad &apos;s not here .
I was already tired .
Do you know why he has been absent from school ?
My brother has been sick since yesterday .
We lost it .
What have you given me ?
I wanted to help you .
Tom likes Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is happy or not .
We &apos;ll ask Tom .
None of your business .
I can &apos;t leave now .
I hardly even know you .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
What would I do without you ?
How often do you read books ?
I go to school with Tom .
You &apos;re a good friend .
Tom wasn &apos;t sleepy .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t help you .
I can hardly hear you .
We had a little water .
Tom will come .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom will find you .
You don &apos;t have to do this for me .
This is what I want to do .
We prefer to do our own work .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
I know her .
We need that money .
I &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
He no longer lives here .
Tom looked old .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary , but I like her .
This is what I &apos;ve always wanted to do .
Why am I so tired ?
I wish I could help .
You need to help me .
Tom did this over a year ago .
Here &apos;s how we do it .
I &apos;ve already heard this story .
It &apos;s not my car .
He and I are friends .
We &apos;re going to wait until Tom gets here .
She went with him to Boston .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
It &apos;s nearly three o &apos;clock .
Thank you for telling me .
I was so worried about you .
Tom knows what &apos;s up .
If I had money , I could buy it .
Maybe it &apos;s Tom .
Did Tom say why Mary went to Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is .
We don &apos;t have the money .
Are you sure about this ?
Tom asked Mary not to leave him alone .
Tom heard that Mary was sick .
The children are gone .
Tom didn &apos;t know that .
I &apos;m not certain , but I think so .
They &apos;re waiting for an answer .
Tom should come .
I want kids .
When &apos;s the big day ?
I &apos;m here to have fun .
Tom goes to school .
Tom isn &apos;t at home .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
Are you tired ?
I don &apos;t ever want to speak to Tom again .
Why did you buy a car ?
Tom doesn &apos;t work for us anymore .
Tom wants to be in Boston .
He has been busy since this morning .
I can &apos;t do it that fast .
I want us to be friends .
Tom and Mary are doing OK .
What did you do then ?
I think we &apos;d better wait a little longer .
How old is your dog ?
Maybe you ought to let Tom do what he wants to do .
Tom will go with us tomorrow .
He is a man of his word .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait .
Is she beautiful ?
Tom does what he says he &apos;ll do .
What do you want to give Tom ?
I only hope that that is enough .
Are you sure that &apos;s what it was ?
Where &apos;s your sister ?
I did exactly what you told me to do .
I don &apos;t want to do that for Tom .
I &apos;m going to bed .
She &apos;d never been so frightened .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
Did you come here to help me or not ?
Let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
We &apos;ll do that .
I don &apos;t know you .
You should &apos;ve known better .
Who is this lady ?
She works all night .
That was quick .
I need to go to work .
What does this have to do with school ?
I think they saw you .
Where did you buy that book ?
Tom ought to have told Mary the truth .
Is that what you said ?
They know that .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of anything .
I barely know Tom at all .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
I &apos;m very afraid .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
I may never walk again .
Tom likes to do almost everything by himself .
It was not always this way .
I &apos;ll be back in a jiffy .
I wonder where Tom has gone .
I don &apos;t believe that .
We have three kids .
I don &apos;t know about that .
Who is your friend ?
Where did you buy that ?
Tom asked Mary not to drive so fast .
In Australia , they speak English .
That &apos;s not how you do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know .
I can &apos;t believe you gave Tom that much money .
I don &apos;t know where you work .
I said I &apos;ll do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;m going to learn French .
What have you eaten today ?
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
Tom may do that with Mary .
I like that , too .
I just need five minutes .
Do you really want to help ?
What were you doing there ?
I don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
You don &apos;t frighten me .
You seem very busy .
I think Tom is up .
Tom was worried that he might be late .
Many thanks .
I became very ill .
Do you know how to drive ?
What does he say in his letter ?
I &apos;m still single .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
I forgot what I was about to say .
What is it that you want from me ?
I have to go home .
Tom knew that Mary was tired .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk .
They have nothing to eat .
I &apos;m not going unless Tom goes .
I &apos;ll be home late today .
I want a lot .
I &apos;ve never been this busy before .
Tom can &apos;t walk anymore .
I hope everything turns out all right .
Did you write this book ?
I don &apos;t think about that .
Let &apos;s eat .
I just wanted to say thank you .
I know I love you .
Tom is as tall as you .
I &apos;ll be better tomorrow .
I &apos;ll tell you the truth now .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
Tom was my friend .
I don &apos;t know if I should believe Tom or not .
I don &apos;t want this anymore .
It was white .
Tom wouldn &apos;t be afraid .
I can &apos;t get Tom to even talk to me .
I enjoyed talking to him .
French is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
Is Tom here , too ?
Tom never discusses that .
Is Tom sick ?
She can &apos;t have said so .
I won &apos;t make that mistake again .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
Have you eaten dinner ?
I &apos;m going .
Why do we have to go home ?
Tom seems as busy as ever .
What did you find ?
Tom wants you to have it .
The car is very fast .
Your dog is here .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
That was the trouble .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
Do you know who wrote this book ?
They want more .
How can you say something like that ?
That has nothing to do with this problem .
If Tom goes , I will , too .
How is Tom going to do that ?
I think we &apos;re safe now .
I don &apos;t have anything to give to you .
I &apos;d never have done that that way .
&quot; Where is her book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
You can stay till tonight .
How are you , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
Tom wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary .
You must tell Tom the truth .
You should eat something .
I don &apos;t want you with me .
When did you buy your car ?
I &apos;m doing fine .
Tom is taking too long .
You know this is a mistake .
Everyone is counting on us .
I still can &apos;t believe it !
This happened for a reason .
Who found you ?
I don &apos;t like Tom and Mary .
I haven &apos;t got much money with me .
I think I like it .
I can understand you to some extent .
What do they look like ?
I don &apos;t want to stay here .
Do you want to go to Boston with me ?
I don &apos;t want this .
Tom isn &apos;t my son .
He made believe he was a doctor .
None of my friends know .
This is what I like about you .
I thought he might come .
I don &apos;t want to buy anything .
Tom wants to go with you .
Tom wants to see you .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve kept you waiting so long .
I &apos;ve never been late before .
It was not easy for us to find his house .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat much .
Tom wanted to talk to me about something .
Can I work here ?
That is what I want to know .
I want a word with you .
I want to read that book .
This is my car .
I knew there would be something to eat .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that kind of thing to him .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
Who &apos;s not busy ?
I &apos;m not going to do that with Tom .
I want my children to learn to speak French .
What do I need to do now ?
I thought Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
She shook hands with him .
It &apos;s the truth .
Tom is my father .
Do you know who I am ?
I don &apos;t like this place .
I &apos;ll never be late again .
Tom must &apos;ve been scared .
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
They aren &apos;t my books .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
How tall you are !
We &apos;ll come together .
I want to forget her .
I &apos;m the last one who saw Tom .
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
I &apos;m not Tom . I &apos;m John .
Tom came to school very late today .
These are for you , Tom .
It hasn &apos;t been that long .
I &apos;ll never help you .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Tom is getting ready .
We &apos;ll have to do that , too .
I have already finished this book .
Tom is pretty much finished .
It &apos;s happened .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
I do not have much time .
I do not want any money .
Why does it have to be me ?
Tom isn &apos;t exactly welcome here .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure what to do .
Tom had all day to get that done .
This isn &apos;t French .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have even been there .
I know what &apos;s going on here .
I &apos;m going home .
I never wanted to do this .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that .
Don &apos;t give me that !
That &apos;s not my problem .
Tom knows that he has to do that .
You must go .
I got a letter from her .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have no more time .
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
I wanna go to Japan .
He arrived with me .
I knew Tom was busy .
Who is your friend ?
I need to work .
They aren &apos;t waiting for the bus .
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
I don &apos;t know what to do right now .
He left the house .
You are what you eat .
Are those guys your friends ?
He walks fast .
What did you say ?
Tom knew too much .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
Those are Tom &apos;s .
She has faults , too .
Both Tom and I work .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she didn &apos;t want to .
Tom looks like he &apos;s happy .
We &apos;re not sure if she &apos;s right .
We found them .
Tom has money , but I don &apos;t .
She is good at swimming .
Nobody asked .
She was ill for a long time .
He will wait .
Where did you eat ?
I will go at 10 .
They aren &apos;t happy .
I have a few questions .
Tom worries about everything .
How old is he now ?
Tom seems to be very sick .
She stopped talking .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what Mary said .
Everyone &apos;s busy .
She is working on the problem .
When are you going to talk to Tom about that ?
When does Tom walk his dog ?
Who gave you this watch ?
Tom said he heard Mary say that .
I am very tired .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t have time .
It &apos;s for Tom .
I &apos;d like to go with Tom .
I &apos;d like to see my son .
Tom never had to study very much .
I &apos;m not happy about that .
Tom looks very happy .
I lost it .
I don &apos;t know why I did that .
Tom is terrified .
This book belongs to you .
I know you have it .
I did no such thing .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
We must move quickly .
Let &apos;s not play .
Money isn &apos;t everything .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
Tom is in Australia .
Only Tom and Mary were at home .
He also speaks French .
I want to tell you something .
I can &apos;t stay for long .
Tom is only happy when he &apos;s with Mary .
I like being with you .
Tom wanted Mary to know .
Let &apos;s go !
Tom isn &apos;t here now .
Where is your dog ?
I want to do it again .
I know something you don &apos;t .
Are you alone now ?
You certainly have a lot of questions .
Let me go alone .
Where is it ?
Tom is a very fast swimmer .
It &apos;s not here .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
I want to make Tom happy .
I know Tom is tired .
Tom must leave now .
I can &apos;t see you .
He must be tired .
Where did you go to school ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom gave it to Mary .
That &apos;s not exactly what happened .
I &apos;m not done .
How long is it ?
I knew Tom was going to do that .
I want to hear the whole story .
I &apos;m sorry about that , Tom .
Tom said he thought Mary was in Boston .
That &apos;s what I thought .
I know her by name .
This book is hers .
Tom is my friend .
You can &apos;t pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
Why do you want to help the police ?
You don &apos;t look well .
It looks like Tom .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
What kind of books do you like ?
Don &apos;t you know ?
People like to talk .
Tom told me he was going to talk to Mary .
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
Why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
I &apos;m a friend .
I can &apos;t live without Tom .
This doesn &apos;t happen very often .
It has to be done .
Are you from here ?
When did you buy it ?
I wanted to help , but there was nothing I could do .
How long do you plan to stay ?
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary for a long time .
This book is meant for children .
Tom is here already .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
Japan is not what it was ten years ago .
Do you know how to do this ?
I hope the bus will come before long .
Tom asked Mary to give him some money .
No one says that anymore .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
What &apos;s going on in this town ?
Mary is a girl .
He speaks English well .
I like my new job .
What have you been doing all this while ?
What are you going to do ?
Have you heard what I said ?
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
I &apos;m not from Boston .
We &apos;re all alone .
Is this my life ?
There are people here who need your help .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have a lot of money on him .
Tom said he &apos;s fine .
Everyone was there .
Are you busy ?
I simply don &apos;t know .
What &apos;s there to do ?
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Please tell me this isn &apos;t true .
What did you do last night ?
I want to go to Australia with my family .
Did you hear that ?
Tom isn &apos;t coming today .
Why do you need to read such a book ?
You had better tell me now .
I wish it were that simple .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Why would someone do that ?
I couldn &apos;t speak .
Nothing much is happening yet .
I think we &apos;ll go with you .
I can &apos;t believe how beautiful you are .
It &apos;s ten o &apos;clock sharp .
What is he doing ?
I must tell you something .
Tom gave us some food .
She &apos;s happy .
I don &apos;t think so .
Who &apos;s coming ?
We live in Boston .
Tom pretended to not hear a thing .
Tom is the same age as I am .
Tom still intends to go .
We can &apos;t see it .
Tom likes them .
Where can we meet you ?
Tom said he &apos;d never leave his wife .
I have no money with me .
It makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
We &apos;re in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary will come tomorrow .
We don &apos;t want to know .
It &apos;s not good .
I don &apos;t want any more coffee .
This dog is Tom &apos;s .
Are you with us , Tom ?
Why is that here ?
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
Let &apos;s talk about this later .
You should not talk here .
I know that Tom is happy .
I need a little more time .
Where shall we meet ?
Tom can &apos;t drive a car .
We have a cat and a dog .
Why don &apos;t you want to do this ?
I know what I &apos;m going to do .
You can stay here as long as you like .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
How many does he want ?
I don &apos;t have a sister .
We are here .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
He is now almost as tall as his father .
I like that answer .
I don &apos;t know what to do or what to say .
I have a few questions for you .
It is too late .
What time is it over there ?
Can you please leave me alone ?
I want to talk to him about it .
I think I know what Tom is doing here .
I &apos;d love to , but I can &apos;t .
Tom became tired .
I &apos;ve got enough money for a car .
Tom was a good father .
Thanks to both of you .
Tom was fast .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see us .
Tom found Mary , didn &apos;t he ?
Where do you want to eat ?
You have a lot of books .
Tom had to leave his dog at home .
All of us plan to do that .
Do you want to do this now ?
How long does Tom have ?
You have to believe in something .
Why are you asking ?
I think Tom knows .
Do you have a lot of time ?
I believe it &apos;s finished .
I did no such thing .
We only use French at home .
I wish that I could help you .
We don &apos;t want that .
What are they going to do ?
She &apos;s found herself a boyfriend .
Tom is almost never late .
I managed to finish the book .
Do you really want to go back to Boston ?
He &apos;s feeling much better .
Do you have many friends ?
He came back soon .
This is my father &apos;s .
Tom is a good French speaker .
You don &apos;t have to work today .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
Can Tom see us ?
I no longer like you .
That &apos;s enough for today .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
They &apos;re not coming .
Tom asked Mary where John was .
How about your place ?
How could I have possibly known that ?
Where is Tom &apos;s car ?
Are you sure you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
It is nothing to me .
I know where you are .
She was there all morning .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
I hardly know anything about Australia .
We must leave right away .
Tom was so busy .
Tom is as busy as ever .
Tom speaks French as well as you .
Let me talk .
Where could he be ?
Don &apos;t give me a thing .
You know what it is , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t like you , Tom .
We &apos;re late .
They &apos;re at home .
I can &apos;t live without her .
We didn &apos;t see Tom .
How long have you known ?
It was so beautiful .
I think Tom might be telling the truth .
Isn &apos;t Tom with you ?
The dog is in the house .
Tom says he knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
We &apos;re studying French .
I want to know your opinion .
You &apos;re not going to like what I &apos;m about to say .
Tom hasn &apos;t been sick in a long time .
He was very busy all day .
We need water .
Tom created this .
You know I don &apos;t have a car .
I wish I had a brother .
You know how they are .
Tell Tom you want to go to Boston .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
My car is parked outside .
We cannot do the work in a day .
No one should ever have to do that .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
It was quite simple .
You &apos;d better consult your doctor .
Does she have a boyfriend ?
I already told you that .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t like you .
I love you more than anything in the world .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
My father is an early riser .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished yet .
I &apos;m afraid .
My home is your home .
Did you really do that ?
I don &apos;t quite know what to say .
What did Tom know ?
Tom copies everything I do .
Tom won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
I &apos;d like you to have this .
They didn &apos;t find Tom .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that , could he ?
We &apos;re not busy .
Are you alive ?
Tom ate dinner .
I really want to know .
Tom , is that you ?
Don &apos;t you want me to go with Tom ?
It really doesn &apos;t concern you .
It was here that I saw her .
I don &apos;t know what to believe .
I haven &apos;t got it yet .
He will never live up to his parent &apos;s expectations .
We &apos;re here for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be there .
You know too much .
The story about Tom eating my cat isn &apos;t true .
He &apos;ll be along in ten minutes .
You know where everything is .
I &apos;m not the problem .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
I don &apos;t think she can speak French .
I am happy to have so many good friends .
You know what this is , don &apos;t you ?
Did you do it ?
I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
My father got home late last night .
He was satisfied with his new car .
I want a job .
He isn &apos;t here because he &apos;s ill .
They &apos;re about to leave .
Are you correct ?
Tom has to go home now .
Tom is very tired .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
I want you to be happy .
All of them swim very fast .
Tom might not be as happy as we think he is .
Where is your friend ?
Where &apos;s Tom going ?
Tom also speaks French .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom is through doing that .
We &apos;ll talk about that later .
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
Tom works .
They &apos;ve been at it for hours .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
I only want Tom .
I don &apos;t think I like it .
How large is your family ?
You and I are going to have a lot of fun .
Have you heard from Tom ?
Where &apos;s my money ?
Why do people do this ?
He said that he would be back soon .
Why is that ?
I don &apos;t need anything .
Tom said he saw Mary yesterday .
Tom is too busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go .
I want Tom to do it .
Have you ever seen anything like this ?
Why is everybody afraid of Tom ?
I have to go back to Boston .
I can see some people walking across the street .
Tom looks nice .
We need to know .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I lost everything .
That &apos;s not true at all .
He has written two books .
What does he intend to do ?
Tom and Mary are both happy .
I know how busy you are .
Nobody does it better .
Tom is coming , too .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
Tom was extremely helpful .
Tom isn &apos;t done .
I want you .
Tom has started dating Mary .
Tom has to stay in bed .
Tom handed Mary something .
Why are we stopping ?
&quot; Who is it ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s your mother . &quot;
Tom was quick .
Give it to Tom .
We lost .
Where are they living ?
I have another sister .
Are these all your books , Tom ?
I know you &apos;re Tom .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he returns home .
All we can do is wait .
My wife and kids were there .
Can I get something to eat ?
Where do you live ?
It &apos;ll be good .
I was busy .
I need it by tomorrow .
Tom has to do this .
Tom knows exactly what to do .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
It &apos;s not like it used to be .
Did Tom eat dinner ?
How long do I have ?
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
Tom opened a window .
We &apos;re still here .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was afraid .
Tom said he wants to go .
We &apos;ll go .
I &apos;m alone now .
I don &apos;t have time now .
Did you make it ?
I saw Tom a few minutes ago .
I don &apos;t have any plans for tonight .
I know Tom is your friend .
It &apos;s quite simple .
I have just what you need .
He does not get up early .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Why didn &apos;t I think of that ?
What was that ?
I know it was you .
I met Mary yesterday .
Nobody came .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
They say it &apos;s up to you .
You shouldn &apos;t have come alone .
Could you say that again ?
What have you got ?
I wanted to talk with you .
What &apos;s Boston like ?
Tom is very busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom wanted to come with us .
Tom didn &apos;t come home .
Boston is a big city .
I &apos;m through doing that .
Tom just wants to have fun .
Why are you so tired today ?
The door won &apos;t close .
Tom seems to know a lot about me .
We don &apos;t have to be here .
It &apos;s for me .
Why are we really here ?
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
They need to work tomorrow .
You &apos;ve got to do it now .
Tom is very good-looking .
I think it &apos;s true .
Can his story be true ?
I think we need more time .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
Tom wanted to say more .
How did you come by the money ?
You know this .
I know what I have to do .
I want to help you .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;ll do .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s brother ?
I know everyone here by name .
I don &apos;t recognize any of these names .
Is the door open ?
I want to live forever .
I want to buy something to eat .
There &apos;s something I &apos;ve been wanting to ask you , Tom .
I think someone &apos;s at the door .
We needed to do that .
He asked me if I knew his father .
Are you alive ?
Tom is doing what he loves .
We can &apos;t go right now .
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
He is able to swim very fast .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
It could have been me .
I found out where Tom lives .
I don &apos;t want you .
Do you have a bike ?
Tom has to give Mary something .
I really want to know what &apos;s happening here .
She testified against him .
You can have this .
When do you eat dinner ?
Tom speaks a little French .
I saw her leaving the room .
I knew what needed to be done .
Tom said he &apos;d never been to Boston .
I am poor at swimming .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that woman .
How late is it ?
Is Tom from Boston ?
He crossed the street .
Tom was supposed to come .
It &apos;s a problem .
I can &apos;t say that .
I have seen it a lot .
I am not a doctor .
Mary doesn &apos;t look like her mother .
I have a great deal to do .
There &apos;s nothing there .
What will you do ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
Tom is the man of the house .
Tom is quite handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
There was absolutely nothing you could do about it .
I &apos;m still in school .
We &apos;re very busy just now .
Tom said that I should leave .
You can do anything you want to .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
It &apos;s none of your business .
I know you like Tom .
Tom and I want to study French .
You &apos;re back again .
I can understand why you don &apos;t want to eat there .
That &apos;s what I like about Tom .
We &apos;re tired .
You should stay at home today .
She often comes late .
Tom said that he would come .
Nobody wants you to do that .
They say that he is seriously ill .
You should meet him .
Why do they want me ?
My door was closed .
I know you .
We know what we have to do .
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him .
We know you &apos;re in here .
You are as tall as my sister .
What &apos;s Tom doing in there ?
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
How many years have you been studying French ?
Where do they do that ?
Tom kept looking at Mary .
I &apos;ll go with you .
We hardly see you anymore .
Tom and I had a lot of fun together .
You &apos;re a good mom .
He &apos;s very ill .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
You &apos;re not eating very much . What &apos;s wrong ?
He had no friend to talk to .
Tom saw nothing .
Did you go straight home after school yesterday ?
We &apos;re done here .
What did you do yesterday ?
I have some reading to do .
Is Tom finished eating ?
You need to leave .
You may still do it if you want to .
You &apos;re like a father to me .
Tom may come today .
School is over now .
The work was very difficult .
Give me a little time .
Please stop it .
They don &apos;t know yet .
My son can neither read nor write yet .
Tom has more money than Mary .
Can you walk ?
It was nice meeting you here .
Tom asked me to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money .
I wrote Mary a letter .
Did you go to school yesterday ?
I think now is the time .
Tom never wanted to study French .
I just want a little more coffee .
I ate too much food yesterday .
Where have you been ?
I gave Tom one of those .
You know Tom won &apos;t do that , don &apos;t you ?
Thank you for being here .
Tom might be right .
I guess that &apos;s good .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where we are .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
How was Boston ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
Is it for me ?
He &apos;s getting up early .
I was there yesterday .
She wanted me to come .
Tom always does that by himself .
I have to be here .
I had to stay in bed all day .
Tom is going to help us .
Tom may not do that .
What did your wife say ?
How many times have you done this ?
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
Tom listened to what Mary was saying .
It &apos;s too soon .
What does Tom want to say to Mary ?
I know it very well .
Tom left yesterday right after you did .
What does that have to do with us ?
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
He is afraid of the dog .
Give it to me .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
I don &apos;t know what Tom said .
Tom wasn &apos;t telling the truth about where he &apos;d been .
We &apos;ll meet Tom .
I &apos;m not old .
I don &apos;t really know .
I will go swimming tomorrow .
Is it really possible ?
We &apos;re out of coffee .
Tom no longer lives with his parents .
Tom is no longer living here .
I love you very much .
I &apos;m here as a friend .
I want to see it for myself .
You are a schoolteacher , aren &apos;t you ?
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
I thought a lot about what Tom said .
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
I can &apos;t take my eyes off her .
I know this .
I &apos;m sorry . I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom and I are friends .
Tom likes him .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
Tom wants to stay .
My French is not good at all .
I &apos;d like to know why .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
We want to help you .
Tom really enjoys being a teacher .
You swim very quickly .
You need me more than I need you .
You &apos;ll have to come with us .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Tom saw that Mary wasn &apos;t in the room .
That &apos;s none of your business .
We have an understanding .
I &apos;ve never been to that town .
Tom took Mary home .
This is Tom &apos;s sister .
It wasn &apos;t that hard .
She is in need of help .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
I &apos;m only going to say this once .
I am going to my room , where I can study .
This is a good question .
Tom and Mary are talking to John .
I like you a lot .
Has Tom left yet ?
The job is practically done .
We can &apos;t help you .
Doing that made me sick .
Tom and I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
I think we found it .
What do you want me to do about Tom ?
What is it like in Boston ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
We can talk about it later .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s true .
I can &apos;t drive .
You &apos;d better go now .
He &apos;s too old for her .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him before .
I can &apos;t remember how I got home last night .
She always looked happy , but never was .
Tom is sure Mary is right .
I told her that she was right .
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
Tom is good at French , isn &apos;t he ?
I want you with me .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
People around here often do that .
Can I go home now ?
When you &apos;ve finished reading that book , I &apos;d like to read it .
What are we to do ?
You &apos;re too good for me .
Tom said he &apos;d wait .
He made a mistake .
Is that something for me ?
Where do we have to do that ?
How long was Tom in the water ?
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
I think that it was his mistake .
Nobody saw it coming .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
You said that last time .
I got here as fast as I could .
We never swim .
This is something Tom made for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Tom said that he was too busy to help Mary do that .
How do you do ?
I gotta do what I &apos;ve gotta do .
Tom looks like he &apos;s sorry .
This isn &apos;t good for Tom .
Who &apos;s working tonight ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to eat that if he didn &apos;t want to .
That &apos;s how it should be .
We aren &apos;t kids anymore .
This one &apos;s my room , Tom .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
It &apos;ll be good to get home .
I thought it was best not to say anything .
Tom and Mary are still together .
Tom had never been to Boston .
I wish to see my father .
That &apos;s not what you said .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
That &apos;s what I want to understand .
Tom is going to school in Boston .
I must be leaving now .
Get word to Tom .
I &apos;m happy where I am .
What is it now , Tom ?
Let me help .
She left here right away .
That &apos;s all Tom wants .
Why would you do something like that ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is doing that .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom wanted a new car .
I need a medic .
Do you know why you &apos;re here ?
I still don &apos;t know what happened .
Is that what I think it is ?
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
Tom was right about one thing .
The car is in the way . Please move it .
Tom couldn &apos;t say anything else .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us .
I wrote it myself .
I hope we &apos;re not too late .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
She doesn &apos;t have any friends .
You &apos;re here .
Regardless what he does , he does it well .
I want to play .
How are you today ?
Tom never told me he wanted to go to Boston with us .
I &apos;m more than happy .
Can you do that again ?
Tom wants to do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
He will come .
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
Why do you want to see Tom ?
We aren &apos;t like that .
My book is here .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it now .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here today ?
I think Tom is happy .
What exactly do you want to do ?
You hardly ate anything .
Tom has gone to school .
I &apos;m going to speak to Tom .
I met him .
I have many things to do .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
I have to go to the doctor today .
Tom and I were really worried about you .
Tom says that he loves Mary .
You didn &apos;t have to do this .
I came yesterday .
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
Do you have a girlfriend ?
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
Thanks for seeing me .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
What should I buy ?
I can &apos;t leave until I find out who Tom is .
I don &apos;t love her anymore .
How long ago did Tom leave ?
Did you get her letter ?
He can swim well .
He is not so tall .
That &apos;s just the way he is .
I think we need those .
I &apos;ve never heard you talk like that .
I didn &apos;t want you to read that .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
I &apos;m going to do that again .
This table is heavy .
Is that Tom ?
They should ask Tom first .
What was there ?
I just need to talk to you .
I need a lot of books .
It has to be done .
I should &apos;ve talked to Tom first .
I was alone .
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
We &apos;re not doing anything .
You have my word on it .
We &apos;re about to go home .
You aren &apos;t like the other kids .
Thank you for this , Tom .
Tom is better .
Say what you want .
That &apos;s what I have to do .
He bought a car .
I &apos;d like to help you .
I like the people here .
They &apos;re all scared of Tom .
We &apos;ve already met .
I don &apos;t wanna hear a word from you .
How long has Tom been gone ?
He has a few friends .
I still haven &apos;t done it .
Where is my dog ?
Is that all you want ?
We know it &apos;s you .
I &apos;ve seen them .
Tom has been in Australia for three years .
It &apos;s best not to ask .
There were too many people there .
I can do it myself .
Do you know why Tom isn &apos;t here ?
Tom seems tired tonight .
Is your child a boy or a girl ?
We have enough time .
Tom is as old as I am .
Tom will do that .
Tom isn &apos;t the same man he used to be .
I should just go home .
Tom can speak a little French .
I can &apos;t see Tom .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary , but he couldn &apos;t find her .
This is my father .
Tom came yesterday .
I &apos;d really rather not eat that .
I should &apos;ve done that .
I can speak English .
He &apos;s looking good .
What are you and Tom up to ?
Can you hear us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know a thing about me .
Who said it was going to be easy ?
Don &apos;t you ever let me hear you talking to your mother like that again .
You &apos;ll want to see this .
Let &apos;s see what Tom can do for us .
I gave my word .
That &apos;s not for you .
That &apos;s what everyone does .
You can go home now if you like .
Tom and I are the same age .
I &apos;d like a car like yours .
I wasn &apos;t busy .
That &apos;s my dog .
Return this book as soon as you can .
Tom is in Australia , but Mary isn &apos;t .
I have children .
I know you &apos;re right .
That doesn &apos;t concern me .
I don &apos;t want to eat here .
You sure eat a lot .
He needs help .
Tom no longer has to do that .
I &apos;ve got everything I want .
You need friends .
I have to go to work .
I had to buy some food .
Let Tom do that .
Nothing can be done .
Tom &apos;s family is here .
Tom didn &apos;t see it .
If that &apos;s true , then she &apos;s better than me .
Tom always arrives early .
He has enough money to buy it .
Tell me what you want me to do .
We have one for you , too .
I found my book .
Nobody tells me anything .
I had fun at school today .
I am busy today .
Is that all Tom told you ?
Tom said this kind of thing happens all the time .
Tom , you don &apos;t have to do that .
I didn &apos;t know you could do that .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Tom must be from Boston .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for years .
When did you go to work ?
I really should be getting home .
Tom looked at his watch .
Have the children eaten yet ?
I want to see what happens .
You should have come earlier .
I love Australia .
Tom lost his job .
You made too many mistakes .
I know exactly where it is .
When will he go home ?
I can &apos;t leave .
I don &apos;t like that one .
He was very happy .
I don &apos;t like the name Tom .
I like Tom .
What do you have here ?
I have done everything I could do .
What did Tom just tell you ?
Tom knows about that .
We want to see Tom .
I didn &apos;t buy anything .
Tom and Mary are gone .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will do that .
I had to stay in bed for a while .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I need you to come with me .
I think Tom is getting ready .
Tom and I will meet you there .
I don &apos;t think I said that .
You have to go home .
I think I &apos;ve made a mistake .
I really have to go now .
Tom said that it might be true .
I want that one .
It doesn &apos;t always happen .
Let &apos;s help Tom .
Tom just bought a car , too .
Who was here ?
You are my friend .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
That &apos;s how he likes it .
My opinion doesn &apos;t really matter .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
Sorry , I can &apos;t help .
Hold on to it .
Do you want to go , too ?
Tom seems sick .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to us .
That &apos;s what people say .
He was underwater for three minutes .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
I &apos;m thinking about you .
Tom made Mary do that .
How long do we have to wait ?
She gave me several books .
We need you .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether what Mary says is true or not .
I love talking to you .
I can &apos;t do this .
This book is Tom &apos;s .
What were you doing out here ?
Tom &apos;s finished .
Where is your sister ?
I saw her a week ago today .
Copy this , please .
I can &apos;t believe Tom told you .
Tom was supposed to meet me here .
This is how I made it .
I &apos;m so sorry about that .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
They &apos;re coming .
He was supposed to go to school .
Where are you going to live ?
I don &apos;t think anyone was here yesterday .
I can see why Tom likes Mary .
Tom should &apos;ve been here .
What is it you want me to do ?
Tom has a car .
Tom lives on this street .
What does your dad do ?
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t like children .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
Why do you want to do that ?
You still have much to learn .
What does it say ?
I can &apos;t talk to Tom .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
How could it be ?
They will understand .
She wouldn &apos;t speak to him .
You need to go to bed again .
Is that coffee ?
I must know the truth about him .
I think Tom can help .
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago .
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
Why did she do that ?
Don &apos;t let children play in the road .
Does he have a dog ?
I didn &apos;t see her .
You &apos;re way too late .
I &apos;d rather not talk about it .
I need some water .
Is somebody there ?
I want to know why you did that .
Tom has his kid with him .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Boston .
I don &apos;t have any books to read .
No one knew who he was .
The book is white .
Tom will go .
This matter does not concern me .
I can &apos;t tell you any more than that .
I was happy to do it , Tom .
That &apos;s my book .
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
We haven &apos;t seen anyone .
There is no clock in my room .
We plan on staying a week .
Tom will go alone .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
I know Tom is your friend .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom wanted to know why Mary wasn &apos;t here .
Tom seems happy .
He went out of the room .
This is the very book that I want to read .
You know what I like .
I have the money .
Tom is good at writing .
I need to go back to Boston .
Do you know how to get to our place ?
We know very little about it .
I &apos;ve already had a coffee .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come or not .
I told Tom I couldn &apos;t do it .
I need coffee .
Tom got sick .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , but Mary is .
Tom said he was afraid to do that .
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
A boy is walking across the street .
I go to school here , too .
I wish I could talk about it .
I just received your letter .
Why are you still here ?
Tom saw Mary do that .
Tom is back .
He has more books than I do .
I &apos;ll stay here as long as I can .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
What is it you want to know ?
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
You &apos;re going to do fine .
There is only one bus every two hours .
What do they do ?
It &apos;s not yours .
Tom never talks about his job .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
When we are told not to come , we become all the more eager to go .
Let me know what I can do to help .
We need to speak to Tom again .
I want to be with my family .
I want to be in Boston .
Let me leave !
I don &apos;t want to wait until tomorrow .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
I can &apos;t leave Tom there .
What is he up to ?
I was busy all day .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
We &apos;re going out .
Tom said he had been busy .
I feel good .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting here like this .
What did you do last night ?
I think Tom liked it .
What &apos;ll you have ?
I &apos;ve never had that problem before .
Tom , will you stop that ?
That &apos;s just not enough .
You have many books .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do .
It &apos;s good to have you home .
What is it that we have to do ?
He left the book on the table .
How are you ?
Tom is on his way to Australia .
We &apos;re having fun .
Tom found a job .
You know what I want .
I don &apos;t know if I can come .
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
He &apos;ll be here again .
I know about you .
She does not do things like that .
I should go to Boston .
I knew that was Tom .
I went home .
I have a wife and kids .
Tom won &apos;t leave .
You should leave at once .
Why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
I &apos;ll do what must be done .
What have you guys been up to ?
Where did Tom see you ?
That &apos;s what I said all along .
We &apos;re not doing this again .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
Tom is three years old now .
That isn &apos;t what I want to see .
I can &apos;t walk .
I only have ten books .
We need to speak with you .
Can you hear us ?
There are many people who don &apos;t speak French .
We need to know where Tom is now .
You can use this car .
Who has it now ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
Tom has a wife .
You scared Tom .
Is Tom right ?
He didn &apos;t see anything .
The entire town was under water .
There &apos;s no mistake .
I only know what Tom told me .
Aren &apos;t you happy , Tom ?
Tom wanted to learn how to read .
The work must be completed at once .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
I &apos;ve got to speak to Tom .
This is all you have to do now .
What &apos;s wrong with you , Tom ?
You need friends .
What &apos;ll you do with Tom ?
I &apos;ve still got work to do .
We &apos;ll see to it later .
Tom had the whole house to himself .
Tell me everything you know .
There was a lot of food in the house .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
He doesn &apos;t need to work .
Who is this girl ?
I think that &apos;s where Tom is now .
Father bought me the book .
I went to school there .
Tom is never late for school .
He gets up early .
What &apos;ll this accomplish ?
That &apos;s easy for you to say .
You should eat .
Why did you do that ?
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom hadn &apos;t done that ?
He &apos;ll be safe with me .
Tom , you &apos;ve got to talk to Mary .
You and I are good friends .
I know it &apos;s none of my business .
I need to know who you are .
I have already written a letter .
I &apos;m not sure why I &apos;m here .
Tom saw a doctor .
I want to know what you know .
What do you know about it ?
She could not swim .
When &apos;s Tom coming ?
Where are we exactly ?
She speaks quickly .
Tom is good at this .
You &apos;ve both been very helpful .
Why would anyone do such a thing ?
It &apos;s time we went home .
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
Do you have children ?
My father is as busy as ever .
That is quite possible .
I told Tom to help Mary .
Who saw me ?
I know why Tom is here .
He doesn &apos;t care a bit about me .
How did he find us ?
I don &apos;t want to have anything to do with that .
You know what I think .
I won &apos;t see him anymore .
Did he tell you anything ?
I think Tom said that .
I no longer want that .
Tom didn &apos;t come home last night .
What are you girls doing ?
Ask Tom .
I really thought Tom was happy .
I &apos;ll be with Tom and Mary .
My brother is now in Australia .
Tom wants us to go with him .
I asked him what his name was .
The bed in Tom &apos;s room was unmade .
What &apos;s Tom doing ?
We understand that .
Tom likes Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
He is happy .
What &apos;re you up to today ?
It isn &apos;t much further .
They didn &apos;t do anything .
She gave him a book .
You won &apos;t believe it .
Her family is very large .
I have run out of money .
Where is Tom anyway ?
Do you have any further questions ?
I think he &apos;s happy .
I just don &apos;t believe it .
We don &apos;t have enough food .
You kids must be tired .
That &apos;s what I said .
I know the way .
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
Do you want to take it ?
The truth is that I don &apos;t really love you anymore .
Why are you doing this ?
I have to give Tom this book .
How long were you in Boston ?
Why did you write this book ?
What kind of man are you ?
Are you happy or not ?
I couldn &apos;t go to work because I was sick .
I can find my own way out .
Tom wasn &apos;t there either .
It &apos;s nice to have friends .
We bought this in Australia .
He is still standing .
He doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
I do hope that he will get well soon .
He wanted to buy a book .
My eyes are tired .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t well .
Tom knows how to read French .
You must be from Australia .
I took it .
What do you want to tell us ?
He &apos;s old enough to go to school .
What did they do ?
You need to get ready .
Tom is old enough to drive a car .
Tom found it .
My friends don &apos;t know where I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any better .
They don &apos;t have to know .
Tom , Mary and John are all here .
What do you really want to do ?
I thought Tom had enough money to live on .
Tom wants me to go with him .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me .
Tom should leave now .
Aren &apos;t you scared ?
Tom and I are still friends .
We &apos;re not friends anymore .
Tom pretended that he knew nothing about it .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
I &apos;m sorry I have to go .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave his dog with me .
Tom has a lot of friends to help him .
I &apos;ve got nothing .
Tom is barely alive .
Why is Tom in Boston ?
You know who I am .
It &apos;s a bit further way .
He arrived late .
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
He himself did it .
Who told you I would help you ?
What have you been doing ?
Tom wants this one .
I didn &apos;t know that your mother lived with you .
What have you ever done for us ?
I wish somebody would help me with that .
I had nothing to do with that .
I really wish there was something I could do .
You &apos;ll see it again .
I think he &apos;ll come .
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
I may go swimming today .
You &apos;re too good to me .
What can you do for me ?
Tom had to do it .
I have to go to sleep .
They don &apos;t want you .
Tom left for Australia yesterday .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Tom &apos;s got school tomorrow .
We &apos;re short on time .
You don &apos;t know where he is .
Who is your friend ?
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
I don &apos;t want to work here anymore .
Tom said he was ready to leave .
You will be safe with me .
This book is easy enough for children to read .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
I do hope you &apos;ll come again .
Tom &apos;s so old .
Did you find your book ?
Why is it there ?
Are you sure Tom is happy ?
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
Why would I tell you ?
I never saw him again .
It happens all the time .
You &apos;ll be happy again .
Tom isn &apos;t a doctor .
Tom can swim fast .
Tom can &apos;t do it .
Whoever wants it may take it .
Why don &apos;t you and Tom do it ?
I would like to see my father .
It &apos;s ten minutes to two .
Tom can &apos;t walk any more .
What have you done ?
It &apos;s still mine .
I don &apos;t want to hear this .
Tom is supposed to be in Boston .
Tom is headed for Boston .
No one says that .
Tom wants a dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me here , does he ?
Tom wrote me a letter .
We don &apos;t have to go .
I don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
Do you have them ?
I came for Tom .
When did you buy it ?
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
I &apos;ll play with you .
How come you know English so well ?
Tom says he wants to study French .
I think I &apos;ve done well .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
He made mistake after mistake .
I don &apos;t know who you are .
I &apos;ve said too much .
I came back home late .
It &apos;s not always easy .
Are you still sleepy ?
Have you seen this ?
It feels like that was only yesterday .
You don &apos;t want to go to Boston , do you ?
Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to do that tomorrow .
I know Tom is fine .
He is as tall as his father .
How are you doing for money ?
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I can &apos;t get Tom to help me .
Tom was the one who wrote this story .
He &apos;s better than us all .
I think Tom knows French .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom .
I think I remember how to do that .
Tom asked Mary not to go alone .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
I don &apos;t know how to drive .
My eyes get tired very easily .
I &apos;m out of money .
What is it that you need ?
Tom and I never quite saw eye to eye .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother .
Please go .
How do you like it ?
What are Tom and Mary doing here ?
What did they say ?
You &apos;re worrying too much .
Never be afraid of making mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
Tom isn &apos;t well today .
Please say something .
Thank you for being my friend .
Tom and I went to school together .
I want to live in a town .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his brother .
I saw him enter the house .
That &apos;s your funeral .
They can &apos;t give me what I want .
This bike is easy to ride .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
Children often make mistakes .
I got what I wanted .
I don &apos;t require assistance .
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
We know everything .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
He &apos;s old enough to be her father .
Tom is not happy about this .
I can &apos;t find a good job .
It runs in the family .
I didn &apos;t know you had a girlfriend .
They just left .
How did you see that ?
We &apos;re like a big family here .
I have something to say .
She is five years old .
How long were you gone ?
I think I should probably go .
I can &apos;t come tomorrow .
Money doesn &apos;t always bring happiness .
I thought you were going out with Tom .
Please give me some water .
Tom really needs your help .
I like Boston .
No one came with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here .
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
You must do it this way .
That &apos;s all we know for sure .
Can I go now ?
I want to make you happy .
I heard you talking .
It &apos;s too easy .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s dad .
I know his brother well .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
I forgot about that .
I speak French fairly well , but not as well as I speak English .
I don &apos;t know anything about Japan .
Can I eat ?
The answer to this question is easy .
What has Tom seen ?
Tom wished he had more money .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
Why don &apos;t we talk about this now ?
I &apos;ll be in the car .
Tom wants to learn how to talk to girls .
I think Tom is too old for Mary .
Tom knew a lot .
When did you buy this car ?
Tom knew .
We can &apos;t turn back .
We &apos;ve seen it before .
Tom doesn &apos;t belong here .
Tom said that somebody here needed help .
When is Tom coming ?
I &apos;m not very good at swimming .
Has Tom finished eating ?
You aren &apos;t one of us .
Tom said he was too busy to help Mary do that .
I don &apos;t know why .
Tom is a good boy .
How do you like Australia ?
I came to give you this .
I think Tom worries too much .
What happened to him ?
All these books are mine .
They aren &apos;t here yet .
Tom said that he never said that .
Let Tom go .
I &apos;m not sure why they do that .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
I am thinking about my children .
We &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
The man is right .
Don &apos;t say such a thing .
Tom and Mary are listening .
I know that money isn &apos;t everything .
So what are you implying ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
Tom does that because he has to .
I know nothing about you .
Why isn &apos;t Tom coming ?
Thanks for that .
Mary is Tom &apos;s wife .
What are you guys doing ?
We &apos;ll be seeing you , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat after all .
He must find work .
Let &apos;s be friends .
People listen to Tom .
Tom walked fast .
Tom went out .
Tom can barely read .
I expect I &apos;ll have to do that for Tom .
No one knew that .
I saw it from the window .
I wasn &apos;t sure if Tom had eaten yet .
Tom took the money .
Maybe she knows the answer .
Tom talks to Mary a lot .
Tom would be able to do that .
We can rely on Tom .
You know what they say about Tom .
You know what to do .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Tom does that quite often .
You are a friend of Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
I think this one is good .
Is Tom better than Mary ?
I have money enough to buy it .
I know you can do this .
When did you buy it ?
What &apos;s it like in Boston ?
Tom gave me that book .
I asked him to wait here .
I wish I had more .
Where &apos;s your mother ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom is scared of me .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
How come you don &apos;t know this ?
The dog needs water .
I think that Tom likes Mary .
Tom hasn &apos;t returned yet .
This is the book I want to read .
That &apos;s your answer for everything , isn &apos;t it ?
Why is Tom looking at me ?
May I have this book ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary have been together for ten years .
Tom had a son .
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to see him to the door .
We were very busy last week .
Tom has come home .
It &apos;s part of the job .
What are you doing today ?
Tom has been sick in bed for a week now .
We &apos;re not alone .
Tom said he needed our help .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
I wish I could stay here with you today .
Do you want to take that ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe it .
Why do you have only two cars ?
Tom is doing that .
Tom told me it was none of my business .
He quickly went out of the room .
I love you for that .
I still can &apos;t believe it happened .
Give it to me !
I &apos;m not tired at all .
Why did they just leave ?
Tom is a good teacher .
You should get out once in a while .
Tom asked Mary to buy him something to eat .
I &apos;d like to hear your opinion .
You are as tall as I am .
I don &apos;t know that .
Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
I couldn &apos;t help Tom do that .
This is the last train .
Tom doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Let me ask you something .
We want to know why Tom did it .
Thanks for asking .
She may have known the answer .
Tom thought only of Mary .
I &apos;m going with Tom .
Tom likes it there .
You will always be welcome .
I will be back soon .
I like Tom very much .
Is that your new girlfriend ?
Is it too big ?
He was not quick enough .
Tell us why you &apos;re here .
Tom and I are doing fine .
Tom is with him .
When did you buy it ?
What do you know about Australia ?
He looked much better this morning than yesterday .
I have a book .
I need people I can rely on .
Tom needs you .
Don &apos;t you know what this is ?
I don &apos;t like anything .
Did they come today ?
I &apos;m going to do it .
Eat with us .
Tom is playing .
When I saw him last , he was still a child .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t scared .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be as busy as Mary is .
I didn &apos;t know that she was ill .
I can &apos;t say exactly .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
Do you know where she is ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like going to school .
I know what this is .
I know next to nothing .
It &apos;s no problem .
There &apos;s something I need to talk with you about .
They won &apos;t find you .
He is not coming , apparently .
They had fun with us .
You can do this , can &apos;t you ?
You had better tell me now .
Tom knows French .
There are only three days left .
I hope Tom knows .
We &apos;re not good enough .
You know why we &apos;re here .
That &apos;s what Tom said to Mary .
I know all I need to know .
You &apos;re busy all the time .
We &apos;ll take Tom home .
I wanted to help Tom understand what Mary was trying to tell him .
We don &apos;t have to worry about Tom .
These books are very old .
Don &apos;t you know that ?
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
You need to tell me the truth .
How long are you going to stay in Japan ?
Here it is .
Tom no longer lives here .
Why is Tom so good at French ?
I &apos;m tired .
How do they look ?
Tom pondered his next move .
I don &apos;t want to be your wife .
They &apos;re more than friends .
I &apos;d rather go to Boston .
I can see Tom .
I knew too much .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
We &apos;ll come with you .
Tom said Mary is very happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time .
We need more people like you .
Here is a letter for you .
I just need to know you &apos;re OK .
What can you tell me about that ?
I love you more than her .
My father must do the work .
Tom said John is a good man .
He said that you had better go .
I only know that Tom isn &apos;t happy .
I saw you .
He thought I was my brother .
I can &apos;t quite understand .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be here long .
I &apos;ve heard all this before .
I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
How can that be ?
I &apos;m not here every day .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
What &apos;s the matter ? Just tell me .
Tom won &apos;t discuss the problem with me .
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
You &apos;ll have to ask somebody else .
What exactly did you do ?
He seems quite happy .
He is very tall .
I can &apos;t read French .
Do they live with you ?
I want to speak to Tom .
I just wanted to say thanks .
Where exactly did you lose it ?
We &apos;ll get to that .
I &apos;ll stay home and study .
Tom and I are kind of busy right now .
I didn &apos;t know exactly what to say .
Are you sure he can do this ?
Tom is coming with us to Boston .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
I can hardly believe it .
How are your parents ?
That room is not very large .
What did I just do ?
I might be able to help you .
I &apos;m getting old .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Tom wants one .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
Tom gave Mary the money .
Why don &apos;t you want me to know ?
He &apos;s often late for work .
Tom is still standing .
I don &apos;t have it .
He did not buy it after all .
My family is not very large .
Tom almost never says anything .
This is my father .
Why won &apos;t you listen to me ?
My mom doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
You can &apos;t help Tom .
We &apos;ll all go there together .
Tom was going to do that .
They &apos;ll find us .
Tell him to wait .
Tom is literate .
Can I speak in English ?
I have a sister .
You know where to find me if you need anything .
I know what they are .
I must have forgotten it .
Tom works too much .
May I have this book ?
It &apos;s always like that .
I was at a friend &apos;s house .
You &apos;ve come too early .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know that .
You &apos;ll get well soon .
I &apos;ll need your help .
Let me help you .
You should ask Tom yourself .
The money is on the table .
Tom wished Mary could &apos;ve gone with him .
Tom found my bicycle .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough friends .
Why did you leave ?
That &apos;s exactly what I want .
I didn &apos;t mean to frighten you .
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
Thanks for seeing me .
I &apos;ll get to it .
When are we going to do it ?
I &apos;ll be doing that with Tom .
We &apos;re finished here .
You are one of us .
Why &apos;s Tom going to Boston ?
How many books do you have ?
How are you ?
You didn &apos;t tell him anything ?
Can you eat these ?
I have a little money now .
Where is the money , Tom ?
Tom knows about this , doesn &apos;t he ?
I think about that from time to time .
I &apos;m sure that I can handle it .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows exactly how that happened .
Tom wants to see us .
Why do you think ?
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
I want more than that .
You had better learn either English or French .
We are worried about you .
I could do this all day .
I know you know this .
Did you do something you shouldn &apos;t have ?
Tom has made a mistake .
I want you out here .
Tom &apos;s talking to himself .
We can &apos;t leave Tom .
I love doing that .
They figured it out on their own .
That &apos;s more than enough .
They all have come .
He is free from care .
Tom is like a brother to me .
I can &apos;t hear a word .
She did not come until two .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on around here .
What are you two doing ?
I can &apos;t help it .
He saw everything .
I like Boston a lot .
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
Tom said to ask you .
Has Tom come ?
The town was deserted .
That would really make me happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
How hard would it be to do that ?
They made me wait for a long time .
He speaks English fairly well .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
Tom wants one .
I have no money .
Keep the dog out .
That is all .
Tom says you want to go to Boston with us .
The dog seems sick .
What &apos;s Tom after ?
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
I want some water .
I think we can do that .
We won &apos;t forget .
I like this . I &apos;ll take it .
I can &apos;t believe your mom let you go .
Tom &apos;s French is very good .
Why didn &apos;t you just say that to Tom ?
Tom must be tired .
I &apos;m kind of happy .
Who found you ?
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
Tom will drive .
Everyone does it .
I really need a job .
That &apos;s too long .
We are at home .
Did you come by car ?
That &apos;s the way I like it .
Can Tom come , too ?
I think Tom likes Mary .
Tom needs to help Mary more than he does .
I &apos;m home , Tom .
I like going to Boston .
Tom is not to blame .
Don &apos;t you give up on me .
I just want to support you .
Don &apos;t you want to see Tom ?
You can &apos;t help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day .
I want to study English .
He had barely enough to eat .
I had intended to go , but I forgot to .
This book is yours .
Tom was doing that here yesterday .
Tom &apos;ll know .
I left my wife .
You did it all right .
Tom left .
Tom was leaving .
How long will you have to wait ?
He &apos;s old enough to be your father .
You can do it , Tom . I know you can .
We should wait for help .
I &apos;ll give you this .
I want some food .
I gave up .
We need a doctor .
I know what it &apos;s like .
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
You may come if you like .
Is that from Tom ?
Tom and I aren &apos;t coming .
They are reading her book .
My mother gets up early .
Tom might come .
I don &apos;t need them anymore .
We can &apos;t leave Tom alone .
They haven &apos;t arrived yet .
Do you know where I can find it ?
Tom cannot drive .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
I want to learn .
I know that he &apos;s Tom .
What do you know about what happened ?
May I eat a little of it ?
I know where she lives .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
Tom came too late .
Was Tom here today ?
I should &apos;ve listened to my father .
Tom speaks French .
They &apos;re not talking .
I have just what you need .
I don &apos;t think Tom would want to go to Boston with you .
I can &apos;t do anything for Tom .
Is Tom at school ?
Do you have everything ?
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for you .
I am a teacher .
Mary likes you .
I cannot quite understand it .
I don &apos;t believe you .
Tom wasn &apos;t even there .
Why are you so tired ?
Do you have it with you ?
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
I love Boston .
I was so worried about you .
Tom goes to school five days a week .
I &apos;d like to ask a few more questions .
Tom is almost never late .
Did you go to school today ?
You must read this book .
You should go to the doctor .
Tom gave this to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
Tom is your teacher .
Where can I buy it ?
Are you ready , Tom ?
Tom seems busy .
I think I love you .
Tom really should be in bed .
I think you know what I mean .
What do you want to do today ?
What &apos;re you doing here ?
Tom rarely ever does that anymore .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
Is that Tom &apos;s ?
Don &apos;t spend too much money .
I &apos;m sorry for that .
No matter who says so , I can &apos;t believe that .
I &apos;m still the same person I used to be .
Please mail this letter for me .
You have to see it to believe it .
That &apos;s where I want to be .
Tom is only pretending to be sick .
What does Tom know ?
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom again .
Tom won &apos;t be able to go with us .
I don &apos;t have what I want .
That was of great help to me .
There will be no school a week from today .
Tom , are you there ?
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
I want to see your mother .
Thanks for the meal .
There &apos;s a table .
I believe you can help us .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
You &apos;re here early .
I &apos;ll do it , too .
We don &apos;t know what Tom said .
They gave it to me .
Tom said he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
Tom could &apos;ve figured that out without Mary &apos;s help .
I let Tom leave .
Is this what you want ?
He is still here .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
He &apos;s coming .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know how to drive .
I can &apos;t remember why I did that .
May I go home ?
I don &apos;t know how I did it .
I know this is hard .
I have no time to help you with the work .
He has been sick in bed for a week .
You can &apos;t tell me what to do .
I don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
She appears to have many friends .
I &apos;m not your father .
Tom has nothing to do with it .
Do you want to see it ?
Where &apos;s my father ?
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
I don &apos;t have any money .
What does that look like to you ?
Tom heard something and went to find out what it was .
How old is he ?
I believe I have now told you everything .
If you want to be happy , then be happy .
I don &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
Tom , I have something to tell you .
We weren &apos;t at home yesterday .
Can I do anything for you ?
Let Tom come .
I said I &apos;d do it .
We &apos;ll help you out .
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
Tom would rather speak French .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
Tom wants money .
Let &apos;s stay friends forever .
Are they your friends ?
We &apos;re late for school .
Can you drive a car ?
How is it at school ?
I &apos;ve never heard Tom speak French .
Let Tom go .
You didn &apos;t tell me that Tom speaks French .
No one really knows what &apos;s going on .
Tom is not at all happy .
He knows close to nothing about this issue .
Where did you find Tom ?
Can I get a little help , please ?
What kind of food do you like to eat ?
Can I stay ?
I think Tom may do that .
My parents are old .
I don &apos;t think I like that .
Tom moved towards the door .
How old are you ?
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what Tom wants or not .
What do you intend to do with the money ?
I liked it a lot .
My work is almost finished .
I want to do it for you .
It &apos;s time to sleep .
He has been like a father to me .
I know Tom is in Boston .
We can do a lot better than this .
Tom has a lot of friends now .
I &apos;m here for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
Can I talk to you ?
Did you eat too much ?
He will write an answer very soon .
I gave you a book .
They don &apos;t need me anymore .
Tom wants to make everyone happy .
Tom is with us .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Tom , I &apos;m here .
Tom is correct .
Perhaps I can help you .
What time is it now ?
He still wants to come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to eat for dinner .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants .
We have to go now .
I took the book .
Tom didn &apos;t need to wait very long .
Can we help ?
Tom bought his son a car .
Tom wasn &apos;t very sick .
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
Let me know if you need my help .
Aren &apos;t you going to ask Tom ?
Tell Tom that when he &apos;s finished , he can leave .
Tom and I both need help .
I feel like I &apos;ve already been here sometime .
I &apos;m not going to Boston .
Tom is looking at me .
He could not speak French well .
We &apos;re all right .
That &apos;ll do .
What is the cat up to ?
Why in the world did you do that ?
I want to go with you , Tom .
It is said that he is sick .
Tom could &apos;ve bought this car .
All the other kids do it .
What did Tom find ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary everything .
I go to bed at ten almost every day .
Are you all alone ?
You should know that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t sleepy .
This is sick .
I know everything about Tom .
Everything is going too fast .
What goes on in here ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
You know too much .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is going to do .
We &apos;re just looking around .
Many people shop here .
We are afraid .
This isn &apos;t for you .
Tom looked at Mary .
I think we &apos;d better go .
Tom may do whatever he wants .
Are we sure about that ?
This is just water .
I have to leave now .
We weren &apos;t doing anything !
I don &apos;t know where we are .
I want to be able to speak French .
Where did you hear that ?
Maybe I &apos;ll go , and maybe I won &apos;t .
You know what it &apos;s like .
We want to talk to you about that .
I haven &apos;t found Tom yet .
Tom hasn &apos;t got much money with him .
Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I forgot to ask him .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
Tom did everything he could .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have written that .
We &apos;re back from Australia .
I &apos;m not finished .
You can go now .
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
Where &apos;s Tom going to be ?
I do think so .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to understand .
Do you have anything to eat ?
No one saw Tom do that .
Did you like this book ?
Are your parents in now ?
You can &apos;t even help yourself .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like it .
She committed suicide yesterday .
Did you tell Tom that ?
I didn &apos;t want to talk to the police .
Tom must &apos;ve seen Mary there .
You have everything you need , right ?
Tom knew he had to help Mary .
I gave the book to my friend .
The letter was written by Tom .
Tom is not good enough .
He &apos;s looking at me .
Tom will come with me .
It &apos;s work .
Ask your dad to help you .
Tom is like one of the family .
I used to go to school with him .
Tom went into the house .
I can &apos;t come today or tomorrow either .
Who would buy it ?
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
I haven &apos;t eaten .
I wish I had time for a girlfriend .
Tom knows Mary and John are no longer together .
We &apos;ll do it .
Tom is quite old .
Tom is back .
Let &apos;s go !
Tom wasn &apos;t OK .
What do you have in your hand ?
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
We came to Boston yesterday .
Tomorrow morning will be OK .
I like her . She &apos;s so beautiful !
Let &apos;s go by bus .
I think you know what I want .
Tom won &apos;t get back home today .
Tom looked about .
I &apos;m well .
Tom is like my brother .
Where are your parents ?
I love being alone .
Do you have my money or not ?
Please come here soon if you don &apos;t mind .
I always wanted to have a dog .
You may take my word for it .
What did you expect me to say ?
Where are we going to meet ?
Where did Tom see you ?
I &apos;m sorry I said that .
It &apos;s that simple .
We can &apos;t have you working for us .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
I know about Tom .
I can &apos;t talk .
I &apos;ll be waiting outside .
How was the French class ?
That &apos;s not what we have to do .
I don &apos;t like it when you &apos;re so busy .
I &apos;ll take that one .
What happens now ?
I don &apos;t know what this is .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Tom can help us .
I want to learn French .
Do you really want to know the truth ?
He &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
Tom looks well .
I know who she is .
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
Yesterday , he told me the truth .
Where &apos;s my son ?
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
He didn &apos;t know that .
I wish I &apos;d been here three hours ago .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I think about you all day long .
We &apos;ll take this .
We help Tom .
I have got to go now .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
I &apos;m not coming with you .
Can you walk ?
Tom isn &apos;t worried .
She is not as old as my sister is .
Maybe I can help .
This is going to be fun .
I &apos;m going out with Mary .
You eat too much .
I know who likes Tom .
How do we look ?
Tom doesn &apos;t make many mistakes .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t believe Mary would do that by herself .
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
I &apos;ve got a book .
If that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
I have a few friends here .
How do you do it ?
Why aren &apos;t you there ?
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
I want to talk to you about last night .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
She is not herself today .
Give that back to me .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom didn &apos;t want that .
Have you already eaten ?
Why do you want to do that anyway ?
He has enough money .
They believe you .
How do you like it here ?
I ate too much today .
You lost .
What did Tom have to do with it ?
They can &apos;t hear you .
That is something you should not have said .
I &apos;m headed back into town .
Tom is almost as tall as I am .
Tom is a better swimmer than Mary is .
Tom is under the bed .
I didn &apos;t really want to do that .
I don &apos;t want to hear any more .
Does Tom know how to do that ?
It was a mistake .
I would like to say something .
Tom became a doctor .
Tom and Mary never do anything together anymore .
I &apos;m not going to help Tom .
I don &apos;t know much about Boston .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know a thing about it .
You &apos;d better go home .
They aren &apos;t that good .
What do you have ?
They don &apos;t want us .
Tom needs water .
They look busy .
You may take this .
I want to know where you heard that .
I know how old Tom is .
You know almost everything about me .
It is too good to be true .
What can you tell me about Tom ?
Thanks for coming .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
Tom doesn &apos;t look old .
Are you here alone ?
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
That &apos;s exactly what Tom told me .
I answered the phone .
This isn &apos;t for you .
Do you have a large family ?
Tom said he &apos;s going to do that .
You &apos;ll never be alone again .
What does Tom have to say ?
You don &apos;t want this , do you ?
Why are you so busy today ?
Are all of them your friends ?
I don &apos;t often eat out with my family .
That &apos;s a pretty good question .
He can &apos;t do it .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet been found .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom , we have a problem .
He made a mistake .
Tom and Mary look very happy together .
Tom quickly got to work .
I &apos;m eating .
I have finished .
That &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t know .
I think about her a lot .
You &apos;d better not tell him .
They saw Tom .
Tom knows we can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom has said he has to do that .
I should &apos;ve told Tom .
I &apos;ll give these to you .
I had to go back to Boston .
Tom wants to come and see you .
Tom plans to go to Boston next week .
You &apos;ll meet Tom .
I don &apos;t know where you live .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom is .
I hope that &apos;s not true .
Tom came along soon after .
I know myself very well .
I want you to have this .
I won &apos;t say a word .
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours .
I want to play , too .
Tom is coming today .
My father is at home .
How do you do this ?
Tom wants to go home .
She talks quickly .
What &apos;s Tom doing here again ?
Why is everybody scared of Tom ?
You &apos;re from Boston , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom and I both want to go to Boston .
What do you mean by that ?
I want to stay home and read a book .
I &apos;m very busy now .
I feel better every day .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;ll go ?
I need to speak with you right away .
I have just three dollars left .
I &apos;ll be home as soon as I can .
Was I seen leaving ?
Do you want to play ?
How &apos;s my wife doing ?
I &apos;ll get this .
He said that you had better go .
Are you at Tom &apos;s ?
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
We &apos;d better hurry back .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave .
I didn &apos;t know what I should say to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about Australia .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
I thought you said the police would never find us here .
I &apos;m your brother .
Why were you eating by yourself ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with John .
I don &apos;t plan to see Tom till tomorrow .
She &apos;s busy .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I &apos;m all alone here .
Tom wrote two books .
I saw that one coming .
What &apos;s up with you ?
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary does .
I can &apos;t stay .
Tom wanted to meet me .
I &apos;m going to be there .
Tom and Mary are both very frightened .
Everybody &apos;s worried .
Tom will be able to swim soon .
Do you have anything to read ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
I have something else I need you to do .
I bought this book yesterday .
Are you always busy ?
I can &apos;t swim .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is doing that .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
People here are happy .
You &apos;re safe now .
We can &apos;t even be sure Tom is in Boston .
Where does Tom want to live ?
I don &apos;t think this is how it &apos;s done .
I &apos;ve never seen you like this before .
I don &apos;t want to be you .
What is the matter with you ?
Do you know what it is ?
Let &apos;s go to my place .
I love you , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary has done .
This isn &apos;t about us .
There &apos;s no food left .
I wish she had come last night .
They &apos;re yours .
Give it to him .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; house .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia yet .
I do not know anything about him .
She has the big room entirely to herself .
He came back at 5 o &apos;clock .
I don &apos;t have much time .
Are you home ?
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
What is he saying ?
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
Tom wasn &apos;t home .
That &apos;s right .
Tom and Mary are the same height .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
I think we should do some more .
I hope that she will get well soon .
We &apos;ve got enough .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
Tom stood looking out one of the windows .
When did you get back home ?
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I came here to tell you something .
Where have you been all this time ?
Why doesn &apos;t he tell the truth ?
I have often heard him say that .
Tom still goes to school .
Tom finished .
The bus is coming .
I don &apos;t want Tom to do that .
I &apos;m not too tired .
Suit yourself .
Don &apos;t say things like that .
We went to Australia together three years ago .
He &apos;s a friend from work .
What are you implying ?
Tom still lives with his parents .
He lives with his mother .
Tom looked very busy .
He has a lot of money , but has almost no friends .
We have no school today .
I just did it .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his dinner yet .
Tom left , leaving Mary alone with John .
Let &apos;s go swimming .
They &apos;re playing together .
Tom and Mary are fun to be around .
I already told you that .
I don &apos;t want to read this book .
She never told me she had a cat .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t happy .
That isn &apos;t Tom .
I &apos;ll tell the others .
We can &apos;t have you working for us .
There are only two days left .
He may not come .
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
I only hope that is enough .
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that .
I &apos;m not feeling too well .
Let &apos;s get together again !
How &apos;re you doing at home ?
I think we should just be friends .
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
The question is simple .
I wasn &apos;t scared at all .
I have to go back .
Why is Tom not here ?
Who &apos;s watching ?
Who &apos;ll go ?
I asked Tom to come see me .
My sight isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
He doesn &apos;t have as many books as she does .
I think I can help with that .
Tom makes Mary happy .
It was already too late .
He was the last to leave .
It was simple .
Tom &apos;ll go .
That &apos;ll make Tom very happy .
I wanted to stay home .
Why didn &apos;t she tell me ?
How can you help Tom ?
There &apos;s something I need to say to you .
Tom is just like us .
Tom is not happy , either .
Tom might be late .
I would like to see it .
I &apos;m hoping you can help me .
I only hope we &apos;re not too late .
Did Tom go ?
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
How is your dad ?
Tom plans to go by himself .
I just couldn &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t have any money and I don &apos;t have any friends either .
What &apos;s Tom up to in Boston ?
Tom is like a brother to me .
I still have so much to do .
Why can &apos;t we do it again ?
You &apos;re back .
They may come .
I hope he will come .
Tom had nothing to do yesterday .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom is doing .
I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow .
I hear you .
I only hope you &apos;re right .
Tom &apos;s not happy with that .
Is your husband at home ?
I &apos;ve lost it .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you want to eat anything ?
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
We &apos;re not totally ready yet .
We &apos;re coming with you , Tom .
I really have to go .
What do they want from us ?
She really wants to go .
I cannot help you .
I heard everything .
I should never have listened to you .
Tom has a couple of friends in Australia .
That has nothing to do with him .
They believe you .
You have everything .
Tom saw a doctor .
Tom does like you .
Tom found a job .
He didn &apos;t stop talking .
What are you going to do with that ?
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
Tom couldn &apos;t find Mary .
How &apos;s your French ?
They look like us .
I &apos;ll be at home all day tomorrow .
I met Tom today .
This is nothing .
I am at home .
Tom knows where we are .
He asked after you .
I can &apos;t speak English as well as he can .
You &apos;re right , as usual .
I don &apos;t know how you can eat that .
He tried speaking French to us .
The gate was open .
Tom asked Mary to come home .
You have what they want .
That &apos;s the one we want .
There &apos;s too much I don &apos;t know .
We need some money .
Tom didn &apos;t want it .
How does Tom look ?
Do you have a bicycle ?
Tom was here , too .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s father .
I know her very well .
Why do you have that ?
They &apos;ll find her .
That was never my problem .
Why is that a problem ?
Things are looking good .
I am his friend and will remain so .
She couldn &apos;t understand what had happened there .
I really like him .
He is the last man to do such a thing .
Are you a doctor ?
My mother is always busy .
We didn &apos;t see anybody .
Tell Tom that I &apos;d like to help .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I don &apos;t want to go .
Tom said goodnight .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
Even when I was a child , I was able to swim well .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be at home .
I know him very well .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
How many years have you been studying French ?
Where &apos;s Tom been ?
I don &apos;t want Tom &apos;s help .
What &apos;re you doing with this ?
Tom is dating Mary .
We don &apos;t really have to talk about this right now , do we ?
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
He doesn &apos;t eat this , does he ?
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
That &apos;s up to Tom , not me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know about it .
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here .
Stop that !
What do you like to eat ?
I didn &apos;t look at Tom .
Who can speak French better , Tom or Mary ?
Let us go home .
I would &apos;ve liked to do that .
Did Tom tell the truth ?
Tom told me .
You certainly have a lot of questions .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting .
I like being with Tom .
Mary doesn &apos;t have a husband .
What was the problem ?
If you ever need a job , go see Tom .
You must be tired .
Nothing like this has ever happened before .
Why is everyone scared of Tom ?
No one saw you , I hope .
Hasn &apos;t this happened before ?
I &apos;ll go home .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s coming .
Are you really a doctor ?
I can &apos;t drive a bus .
It &apos;s good to have you here .
It &apos;s been a long week .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to be here .
It didn &apos;t end well .
Here &apos;s what I want to do .
Tom made himself something to eat .
I &apos;m able to speak .
It &apos;s way too heavy .
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
I still have them .
It can &apos;t be !
What do you like about it ?
That wouldn &apos;t have happened here .
Is this the train for Boston ?
There she comes .
Tom must be very happy .
It was very simple .
This could be a mistake .
I have seen him once .
What do they want with us ?
Tom and I are well .
I am not the person I used to be .
Let me say one thing .
I love being alone .
You know that .
I don &apos;t have anything to read .
We &apos;re still together .
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
Tom likes to stay at home alone .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was from Boston .
Tom looked into Mary &apos;s eyes .
She has three kids .
This is what I want .
Could you please take me back home ?
You are seriously ill .
I don &apos;t have the money .
You &apos;re cooperating .
How long have you known ?
He was never to see his wife and family again .
You and Tom are good friends , right ?
Tom did it for me .
I can &apos;t get that out of my mind .
This one is Tom &apos;s .
Do you want to see Tom ?
I have to do something .
Just let Tom go .
I would rather not go to school today .
I saw it coming .
I need to get back to work .
They swim very quickly .
Tom didn &apos;t even look at Mary .
What do you do in Japan ?
Everyone is against me .
I &apos;m going to the police .
Tom won &apos;t live much longer .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
Tom is in need of help .
You gave me your word .
Tom made Mary do the work .
Tom didn &apos;t know this .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
I &apos;ll be right with you .
I went to bed early because I was tired .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
He wants to come .
I will go .
I , too , am a teacher .
I need to ask you something .
I &apos;m going to take this .
Tom is your father .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom didn &apos;t know how to swim .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me .
It &apos;s so nice to be back .
I have to be there .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
No one &apos;s looking at you .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
Tom is doing that again .
Do you have a question ?
Tom has no children .
We lost it .
Do you have any further questions ?
That is a very good question .
Tom came into the room .
I love it here .
Tom hardly ever talks .
You &apos;re supposed to be home with your parents .
I have to speak with you .
Where is the station ?
I won &apos;t help Tom again .
Tom can &apos;t handle this anymore .
You &apos;ve done a very good job .
How long will we have ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to want to do that .
Can you take me home now ?
This isn &apos;t about Tom , is it ?
Tom lives with his family .
I don &apos;t need anything now .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
I still love him .
I heard that Tom is sick .
Life doesn &apos;t get any better .
This is how we do it .
Is Tom outside ?
No matter what he does , he does it well .
The boy made his parents happy .
You should do that right now .
You should do it like this .
We &apos;re going to my brother &apos;s .
This is going to be good .
He asked her to read it for him .
I &apos;d love to stay .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
You &apos;ll do great .
Tom is certain .
I &apos;ll never forget this .
I have a lot of work to do .
He takes after his father .
Why should I learn French ?
This is very good .
Tom can &apos;t read .
You have work to do .
Is that true ?
Tom is a friend from school .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
I must find work .
You don &apos;t need to work today .
Tom isn &apos;t going with you , is he ?
Tom was the last to arrive .
I wish you had told me that .
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
Here is the car .
Tom said that &apos;s no problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how it happened .
When are you going to come ?
She didn &apos;t say a word .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; place .
You can lean on me .
Why did you even bother to come ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really here .
Tom has something he wants to say .
I could write a book .
He abandoned his family .
I &apos;m going to stay home tonight .
You &apos;ve often said so yourself .
I &apos;m already at work .
Let &apos;s go downtown .
It &apos;s too big .
You &apos;re old enough to know better .
You &apos;ve been here way too long .
I &apos;m not happy here .
I have a lot of friends .
French is spoken here .
People don &apos;t always tell the truth .
That has nothing to do with you .
He is unable to do it .
You should have seen it !
I &apos;d like to see someone do better .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
How long &apos;s Tom been gone ?
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time .
Tom might be late .
Tom has many friends .
Let &apos;s not forget who Tom is .
This story doesn &apos;t have a happy ending .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t there .
You &apos;re not fast enough .
No one has said a word .
You have time .
Tom is occupied .
Tom is scared of Mary .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten all day .
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
I think I had better not say anything about it .
I gave her a lift to town .
Please come back at once .
I have got to go now .
All of my children live in Boston .
Why did he do that ?
I just want a little more coffee .
How long do I have to stay here ?
Tom should tell Mary that .
Maybe we should wait until Tom gets here .
Is there anything else you want me to do ?
He has many friends .
I made Tom do that .
Where is your sister ?
My house is big .
We can help you .
I should tell Tom everything .
Who was it that gave you that ?
Why would you want to do something like that ?
That will happen later .
How long do I have ?
Tom lost his new watch .
You can &apos;t stay here .
I think we can get everything we need .
Very little is known about them .
I know where to find water .
I want to speak to Tom .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
What are you guys up to ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I asked him not to drive so fast .
I can do that right now .
Was Tom the one who did this ?
I already said that .
I &apos;d like three of these .
It may not come to that .
This is your book .
You should ask Tom yourself .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
She became happy .
I told Tom that I was tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I &apos;m not even sure whether Tom will come or not .
Tom was right after all .
I cannot find time to read the book .
I just wanted to be sure .
Tom wasn &apos;t safe .
Tom made this for me .
Tom gave us everything he had .
You always have to have the last word , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom the truth .
This was too much for Tom .
May I speak to Tom ?
We &apos;re staying .
I &apos;d like to go with you .
Tom says he &apos;s not coming .
Tom and Mary are both good teachers .
Tell me why you did it .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
We haven &apos;t done a thing all week .
It seems impossible that you &apos;re that old .
It &apos;s open to interpretation .
Tom currently doesn &apos;t have a job .
He &apos;s not a boy anymore .
I wish it had been that easy .
Tom felt lucky .
Did you find anything in the room ?
This is my brother &apos;s .
Tom looked happy .
We have only three days .
They &apos;re all good .
It &apos;s hard to believe .
I wish I &apos;d eaten more .
What did Tom have to eat ?
Why did you write this book ?
I didn &apos;t want anything to do with Tom .
See you later .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come with us .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary the truth in the first place .
I can &apos;t go home .
I couldn &apos;t get it .
Tom is better at doing that than me .
You have to take this .
I saw that .
I can wait for you .
I had to go to work .
Ask me anything you want .
There &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
Tom only did that once .
Do you really want to have kids ?
I can &apos;t eat all that by myself .
Tom knew nothing about it .
Nobody knows this .
What &apos;s Tom going to do with it ?
What are you here for ?
It &apos;s all going to be fine .
He has nothing to do with it .
Tom has children .
I don &apos;t know who that boy is .
I think I know the answer .
I &apos;d like to shake Tom &apos;s hand .
Tom wanted to see you .
Tom was supposed to be here .
I love Mary .
How long have you been dating ?
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
Have you eaten ?
Thanks .
I have to do it myself .
I had no work yesterday .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
How can it be ?
Tom has arrived .
What &apos;ve you got for me ?
I asked Tom if he knew Mary .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even discuss it .
She can speak French .
Thanks for doing that .
She &apos;s only a child .
This was my mistake .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom today .
I just have one question .
You know Tom has a thing for you .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
I want to do this at home .
Did you see Tom leave ?
Tom would love to see this .
Tom might know why Mary has to do that .
I think you &apos;re right .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
Thank you for your help .
I think maybe Tom is scared .
Did he say that ?
No one can tell .
Tom likes you a lot .
You have to believe in something .
Tom &apos;ll stay .
We became very good friends .
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
Where are our friends ?
Tom and I have both been to Boston .
He arrived at the station .
They aren &apos;t there .
I &apos;m quite sure of that .
Tom went to school with Mary .
Tell Tom that I was just joking .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy about it .
Everyone &apos;s watching .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom can do that .
Tom and I both are teachers .
What are you going to give Tom ?
Tom , can you hear me ?
I think Tom might be in Boston right now .
How are things with you and Tom ?
I &apos;m not really sure why .
He has three children .
Why didn &apos;t I see that ?
He had a book in his hand .
Tom looked well .
He will be free tomorrow .
She took my hand .
I didn &apos;t eat dinner last night .
Tom has many books .
We need to help Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , is he ?
You ought to have seen it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
I don &apos;t want to talk about my child .
I &apos;m too busy to go .
We &apos;re very busy .
We &apos;re not doing it .
This can &apos;t be true .
We are going to have a baby .
She told me everything .
They &apos;ll never find you here .
Tom has one brother .
I know what I &apos;d say .
I almost forgot it .
You can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
Do you know how to get home ?
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
You &apos;re safe now .
This might not be enough .
Tom gives us what we want .
How long do we have ?
The police were here .
Tom really made you happy , didn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s what my friends keep telling me .
We &apos;ll all go together .
Tom did do that .
I know that Tom does that every morning .
We know everything you know .
He looked pretty tired .
You have to come with us .
Here is a letter for you .
They all speak French .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary .
Here he comes .
That is not exactly what I said .
He has a dog .
Can &apos;t we go with Tom ?
What &apos;s it look like ?
We should study together .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
I think that he won &apos;t come .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
Please wait here .
We live together .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
I &apos;m not going to get it .
You must work .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has a bicycle or not .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Let me help you with your work .
I wanted this .
I &apos;d rather not speak French .
I think I know what Tom is doing .
When would you like me to come over ?
She speaks fairly quickly .
I &apos;m not going to stay here with you .
No one said anything to me .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
That &apos;ll do it .
I bought her a new car .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary ever again .
All you have to do is ask .
I have never done this before .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
I saw Tom in Boston .
This work must be finished by tomorrow .
I liked your story .
I really thought Tom was happy .
I don &apos;t quite know how it happened .
Why &apos;s Tom here and not Mary ?
You should see a doctor .
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
I need lots of time .
Tom asked Mary to make him something to eat .
I wish I had a friend like you .
I &apos;ve come for Tom .
You ought to write a book .
You should eat more .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
I don &apos;t intend to do what Tom told me to do .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
They don &apos;t understand .
That was very easy .
What are you doing here ?
They don &apos;t know who I am .
I wanted to do something for Tom .
This is going to be fine .
I want you to come to Boston .
You know French , don &apos;t you ?
Tom needs money .
We are going to leave tomorrow .
He doesn &apos;t have a sister .
I gave him a book .
He seems to have been ill .
Did you make it ?
How long has this been going on ?
Did Tom eat this morning ?
I saw the teacher walk across the street .
He saw it , too .
We only do what we &apos;ve been told .
Tom came to Japan as a child .
I can &apos;t let you give me your last ten dollars .
Don &apos;t give up on me .
I only have one question .
I &apos;m happy , very happy .
We &apos;ll be here all day .
Tom is going to go to Australia .
Is Tom over there with you ?
I do want to go with you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done that .
I think Tom should do that .
Tom asked Mary if she would help him .
Tom spends too much money .
She is like a mother to me .
These are good .
I can &apos;t depend on you anymore .
You &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t you ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
You should stay at home today .
This book is easy enough for me to read .
Is there a cat under the table ?
He is at home today .
Is he a doctor ?
How is it made ?
Do you have a bike ?
You can wait in this room .
He won &apos;t live much longer .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
Where are you heading ?
I like it this way .
He is my brother , not my father .
How &apos;s your family ?
I was very tired .
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Are you ready ?
You know it &apos;ll be fine .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
I was only joking .
What do you have there ?
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary could swim .
He may come today .
Tom has more than enough money to buy a car .
Are you here to see me ?
Where are your children now ?
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
Do you still have family in Boston ?
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find work in Boston .
I &apos;m out of here .
Tom thought Mary knew John .
I &apos;m coming , too .
Tom is home alone .
What does he say in his letter ?
I &apos;ll give it to you .
I want to come , too .
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow .
I have to go with Tom .
You have to believe in yourself .
Tom only knows how to speak French .
That &apos;s not safe .
Thanks for coming .
I think you &apos;ve been here too long .
Do you want to do it with me ?
I &apos;ve got no plans tonight .
I &apos;m ready to go .
We really don &apos;t have time .
Have you finished ?
What can I do for you this evening ?
It doesn &apos;t concern you .
Do you know where Boston is ?
Tom has left .
I don &apos;t feel like eating now .
I like my house .
Do you have a book ?
I wish that I could help .
I want to be here for Tom .
This one is for us .
I came to say I &apos;m sorry .
Is Tom with us ?
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
We don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
I love being with you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any children .
It just has to be done .
No one would talk about it .
They &apos;re very busy .
If anyone can do that , it &apos;s Tom .
Tom was here yesterday .
They &apos;re not here .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with you .
They don &apos;t want it .
You &apos;re going to have to do it .
Why is Tom &apos;s car still here ?
It wasn &apos;t until this morning that Tom told me that .
Tom has a lot of money .
This isn &apos;t my money .
I know I did that .
You have everything .
Tom is kind of tired . He wants to go home .
They &apos;ll find you .
Do you want to see this ?
I know a lot about you .
You &apos;re a man now .
I feel very sick .
Tom never said anything about where he &apos;d been .
How many hours are left ?
I don &apos;t have it with me .
No one I know talks to Tom anymore .
There wasn &apos;t anybody there .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
I don &apos;t want to do that .
I may be too old .
Tom might hear you .
Tom shouldn &apos;t talk so much .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
Please let me go home .
He fell ill because he ate too much .
Can I do it again ?
There &apos;s nothing more I can tell you .
His house is easy to find .
Maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
They don &apos;t want you to know .
He has been like a father to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want it , does he ?
I &apos;m supposed to talk to Tom .
I do not care for him .
Where can I find him ?
This is still not good enough .
I &apos;m busy right now and can &apos;t play with you .
Is this your book ?
I had trouble understanding what Tom was trying to say .
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
It &apos;s not from me .
I can hardly believe his story .
I &apos;m late .
Tom still has to tell Mary what to do .
Why aren &apos;t you here ?
Was Tom happy doing that ?
This doesn &apos;t mean a thing to me .
I &apos;ve got more .
I &apos;ve been here for three days .
He is pleased with his new car .
If Tom goes , I &apos;ll go , too .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
You can do whatever you want to .
Where did he find the money ?
Why did you buy another car ?
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
She is eating .
They know what &apos;s going on .
I saw Tom leaving his house .
You know why I left .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom anything .
Do you know how busy I &apos;ve been ?
Tom &apos;ll understand .
Why is it there ?
Do you have something to say ?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
He will not go .
That is no business of yours .
I think it &apos;s happening again .
Tom may be at home .
I hope that he will help me .
It has to be there .
Did you give it to Tom ?
What do you want to see ?
Who benefited from that ?
If I had money , I could buy it .
Tom is unafraid .
I &apos;m going to need you later .
Can I see that ?
That &apos;s what we have to do .
Where is my money ?
My mother isn &apos;t at home .
Tom doesn &apos;t like speaking French .
Do you have a car ?
You don &apos;t want to do this .
Tom might need to help Mary .
We all make mistakes , right ?
We know that Tom is here .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows French .
You know that better than I do .
I am ready .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Tom loves doing this .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
You can stay as long as you like .
I &apos;m busy here .
Tom often comes late .
He has no children .
I have a lot of friends to help me .
We feel bad for them .
Tom won &apos;t talk .
The dog likes you .
Tom wants to make Mary happy .
I like Tom a lot , you know .
I must study .
He is tired of reading .
Where should we meet ?
What &apos;s this doing here ?
I won &apos;t talk to you .
I &apos;ve got to do this .
I will say something about it .
Tom says he &apos;s OK .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that at all .
Tom has already gone to bed .
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
I can &apos;t stay long today .
Both Tom and I don &apos;t understand French at all .
You can &apos;t leave yet .
Tom has many friends here .
I have not had anything to eat since this morning .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
I &apos;m not from Australia .
Have you seen this man ?
What happened there ?
It cannot be true .
Are they your friends ?
He isn &apos;t able to buy a car .
I have a few friends .
What are we having for supper ?
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
Nobody wants to play with Tom .
Tom is good at speaking French .
Tom found it .
What &apos;s Tom up to ?
They are not tired .
Tom is your son , not mine .
What does that tell us ?
Tom and Mary are in Tom &apos;s car .
I just want to go home .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have enough money .
You hardly ate anything .
You &apos;ll be safe with me .
You &apos;re my brother and I love you .
There are too many of them .
Let me see that .
I think you have made a mistake .
Tom said he isn &apos;t happy .
Tom and Mary want to see us .
He doesn &apos;t have any friends .
I found something .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
What time are you planning to leave ?
Tom did that for Mary .
You are tired , and so am I .
How is it made ?
There &apos;s nobody there .
What does Tom have to do with this ?
How can this be ?
Why do I have to do this ?
My parents don &apos;t understand me .
We want our kids to be safe .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have any money .
We always want what we don &apos;t have .
Tom has been busy since this morning .
You shouldn &apos;t do his work .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much money .
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
That &apos;s how Tom did that .
Tom didn &apos;t have much to say .
Tom can be relied on .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
We will never do it again .
We &apos;re cooperating .
Give him time .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes me .
Who &apos;d buy this ?
I have one question .
It &apos;s really Tom .
It may not come to that .
I would like to have some more water .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
What exactly do you want to know ?
Why does Tom know that ?
What &apos;s the matter with Tom ?
Tom is now almost as tall as his father .
Who &apos;s that girl ?
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t have children .
Tom has already gone home .
I &apos;d like you to help Tom .
Why is she doing this ?
Do you have time ?
Tom may not be happy .
Tom came early .
You &apos;re looking good !
I wasn &apos;t home .
He did not eat anything yesterday .
No one lives here .
Tom also has a brother .
I was trying to talk to you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
I want that .
Why do people do things like that ?
How do you pronounce this ?
Can we swim here ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
Who &apos;ll drive ?
Let &apos;s ask the teacher .
I have no time to read books .
We &apos;re back home .
He wishes to become a doctor .
Was it fun ?
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
Tom knew that .
The girl standing there is Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom is still in Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom wants to have nothing further to do with you .
Do you want my help or not ?
I &apos;ll go with Tom .
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
I saw Tom and Mary .
I will read a book .
Tom is late .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
I am feeling much better now .
Tom is quite happy .
I thought Tom might be sick .
Money does not always bring happiness .
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I didn &apos;t see it coming .
I &apos;m sorry for what I &apos;ve done .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen again .
Where does he live ?
Why did you do it , Tom ?
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
I &apos;ve got to talk to Tom .
You can study here .
I will stay at home .
How are you doing ?
We &apos;re leaving .
Do you have any more of these ?
I should like to go for a swim .
Why aren &apos;t you at school ?
I have your dog with me .
Tom was alone in his room .
I &apos;d say go for it .
You &apos;re not as old as I thought you were .
I know those girls .
She was about to leave the house .
She &apos;s a woman now .
I &apos;ll work alone .
I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
Tom is a friend of ours .
Tell Tom we &apos;re waiting for him .
Tom may do that for you .
How did you find Tom ?
Have you ever lost ?
Is Tom in ?
What are you going to see ?
Is this dog Tom &apos;s ?
What &apos;re you saying ?
Who &apos;s there ?
I think I &apos;d like to do that .
Don &apos;t give up !
This wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to do that .
Everyone in my family is happy .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
Tom almost never makes a mistake .
I thought he was sick .
What was it like living in Australia ?
We know they &apos;ll come .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
It &apos;s not a dog .
Everyone &apos;s sick .
Tom would wait .
Did you do your work ?
Tom has to go to Boston .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
So what is everyone &apos;s problem ?
She lives with him .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
We know Tom didn &apos;t do it .
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston .
You have to find Tom .
Can I help you with that ?
You certainly have a lot of questions .
Please tell me what &apos;s wrong , Tom .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late .
We &apos;re doomed .
What do they know ?
Don &apos;t you know what it is ?
Tom and Mary are out .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything yet .
She &apos;s much better today .
They are happy .
I have to find Tom .
I have to talk to Tom now .
That &apos;s not Tom . That &apos;s John .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
Is that the best you can do ?
I know where you are .
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
I relied on him .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
You cannot do this .
You weren &apos;t there .
I wish you could &apos;ve come with us .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
You may read this book .
Tom was telling the truth .
I don &apos;t know who did it .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
Tom didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
I want you to drive to Boston .
Tom wouldn &apos;t discuss money .
There are a lot of people here .
What was it like ?
I &apos;m sick of talking about it .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
No one is coming .
Tom &apos;s alone .
There &apos;s got to be an answer .
She said she was happy .
We &apos;re back early .
You &apos;re good at this , aren &apos;t you ?
I couldn &apos;t help myself .
I can &apos;t give you the answer today .
Do you want to be my girlfriend ?
Tom wants a word with you .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
Tom looked good today .
What does that have to do with Tom ?
He came to see you yesterday .
Do you want to help me ?
Is this your letter ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been on speaking terms with Mary for years .
Can I go with you ?
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
My dog didn &apos;t do that .
What are we going to do with Tom ?
I wish I had this problem .
It &apos;s your money .
I love her .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school today .
It &apos;s good to be back in Boston .
Tom never left .
This house is too big for us .
Tom isn &apos;t outside .
I don &apos;t think there is a doctor here .
I really like you .
This isn &apos;t Australia .
Don &apos;t you have school today ?
Tom is the person to ask .
I have to take it .
Why are you with me ?
Tom was hard to please .
I think the train will come soon .
If you really want to speak to me , it &apos;s now or never .
Just say whatever you want to say .
Do you know where Tom is ?
What did you make ?
I haven &apos;t seen that in a long time .
I bought that book for Tom .
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
Tom says he likes it .
Tom can read and write .
I &apos;d like to , but I can &apos;t .
Tom wants to go back to Boston .
How did all this come about ?
That &apos;s what Tom says .
He is a doctor .
Why don &apos;t we head back ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
How does this look ?
You &apos;ve got a problem .
Can I help you ?
Tom can also speak a little French .
We saw it .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
I should &apos;ve done that yesterday .
I disagree with you .
Tom may be up .
Who bought this ?
You don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
Maybe Tom can help you .
What were they doing there ?
The letter returned .
Tom reads French quite well , but isn &apos;t able to speak it .
We don &apos;t have a lot of time .
It &apos;s enough for five days .
Tom has many things he has to do today .
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
Here he is !
I &apos;m not coming .
She knows nothing about your family .
I am no longer tired .
I let him go .
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
Tom is very good at it .
He can come .
Do you want me to be happy ?
It &apos;s ready .
Does Tom have one ?
Tom isn &apos;t the same age as Mary .
That &apos;s not what I said at all .
Why are you in Boston ?
I don &apos;t know why it happened .
You can stay here as long as you like .
It was nice meeting you here .
I did what Tom told me to do .
Tom wants our help .
There &apos;s so much I want to say to you .
We met them yesterday .
I could hear everything .
I don &apos;t think she is happy .
Does anyone still have a question ?
I love them .
He was not sure what to do .
Tom has what he wants .
I don &apos;t mean you .
It really happened , didn &apos;t it ?
Didn &apos;t your parents give you anything ?
Both of my parents don &apos;t know how to swim .
That &apos;s exactly what he said .
I love you .
I stopped going there .
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
Tom is going to dump Mary .
Tom may have seen it .
You don &apos;t scare me .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me what to do ?
I like being a teacher .
I hope Tom &apos;s right .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that for Mary .
I hope that I can do it .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
She is likely to come .
It &apos;s too easy .
You have to believe me .
We won &apos;t be here much longer .
We always take a bus .
Have you finished writing the letter ?
Have you guys seen Tom ?
It is good to see you .
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak English .
What does Tom want with me ?
Tom &apos;s gone .
Do you want to go for a swim ?
Why are you helping Tom ?
I don &apos;t know as many people as you do .
You don &apos;t seem to understand anything .
She &apos;s not a child .
Tom will find you .
Tom ran out of food .
Tell me everything you know about that .
No one knows the answer .
I know where Tom did that .
Both Tom and I are teachers .
I would do it again .
That boy looks like you .
You &apos;d better go by bus .
They &apos;re coming again .
It looks like I got here too early .
Did you see it ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to help Mary ?
What was Tom doing out there all by himself ?
Just where do you think you &apos;re going ?
Tom has to come with me .
What &apos;re you going to do with Tom ?
Tom is going to like being here .
Tom knows that you know .
Tom frightens me .
I wanted to go home .
We have been here for two days .
He did it just for fun .
I think I &apos;d be a good father .
Tom could hear Mary , but he couldn &apos;t see her .
Tom made mistakes .
We &apos;ll take you home .
Tom can &apos;t work .
What shall we do ?
Where is your school ?
I have to study French .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I &apos;m here .
You &apos;re better than I am .
I found this in Tom &apos;s room .
Where &apos;s the teacher ?
They &apos;re in .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
Don &apos;t you have anything to do ?
He says he met my father .
There has to be another way to do this .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
I told you I don &apos;t want your help .
I saw a dog .
What &apos;s it going to be like ?
Tom may not know .
Tom didn &apos;t do it .
What did you make ?
Can we come , too ?
I knew that already .
I didn &apos;t even know you had a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary is .
I have one .
That isn &apos;t my problem .
When &apos;s Tom coming home ?
It &apos;s yours .
I came here yesterday .
Did you get their letter ?
I know what it was .
I believe I can help with that .
This is exactly what I wanted to see .
I &apos;d like some coffee .
I want to be what you want me to be .
We must do it now .
Why are you speaking French to Tom ?
I know what you did in Boston .
Tom has to come .
My mother is a good woman .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
You &apos;ve found it .
You don &apos;t know what I want .
We must find it .
I guess Tom is sick .
Tom is living with his family .
Tom made his mother happy .
Tom walked over to the desk .
Please don &apos;t go away .
I love you .
It &apos;s not for you .
Where is your money ?
He has a lot more money than I have .
I want to tell Mary I love her .
Tom won &apos;t wait .
You may take the book .
They know who I am .
He is my brother .
Money doesn &apos;t buy happiness .
They are the same age .
I prefer coffee .
When did you find this ?
I &apos;ve never met him .
Can you speak French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with you .
Why did Tom want you here ?
I don &apos;t want to hear it .
Do you have a boyfriend ?
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
I just don &apos;t believe that .
I want to tell you the truth .
Why do you have this ?
How many were there ?
I &apos;m not going to be very happy .
We can &apos;t do that either .
I know people .
How do you feel about it ?
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
Nobody wants you to do that .
He took his book .
Children should go to school .
What do you want from us ?
I think we should wait until Tom gets here .
I &apos;ve been here before .
Tom has three children .
I have a sister and a brother .
I don &apos;t know that .
I know your mother .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I &apos;m happy .
You have to see this .
I want you to be happy .
Who is going to speak tonight ?
I &apos;ll be at home .
She took her own life .
My father isn &apos;t home yet .
I want Tom to do that .
Why was I never told about this ?
We want Tom to go home .
We have to do it together .
Don &apos;t say his name .
What &apos;s wrong ?
Do you even know where the school is ?
Let go of Tom .
It &apos;s happening tonight .
Tom says I have to study French .
I just found it .
That was the last time any of us ever saw Tom .
I don &apos;t have much money on me .
I am to meet him there .
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m certain he &apos;s coming .
We &apos;ll make it .
I was in bed already .
What was the question ?
We should go this way .
We &apos;re doing it together .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
Are you still busy ?
They know who you are .
I think Tom should stay .
I wish I &apos;d met her .
She gave up everything for her children .
Tom barely ate .
I wish I could help .
And just who might you be ?
Tom and I both work .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
He did nothing wrong .
What &apos;ll you do after school today ?
I &apos;ll join you later .
I don &apos;t like your friends at all .
He can &apos;t buy a car .
I need to be sure .
You should tell the truth .
I &apos;ll be right there .
We need a car .
I think Tom needs your help .
I think Tom would have liked that .
Do you want to read ?
Is Tom still able to drive ?
I &apos;ll see you later .
He followed in his father &apos;s footsteps .
You were always too busy to talk to me .
You &apos;ll find a job .
Tom is not like that all the time .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be happy .
Tom always looked busy , but never was .
How did it end ?
Why aren &apos;t you in school ?
Do you have a brother ?
It doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
Do you have a family ?
Count me in .
How do you like this town ?
You may have it .
I want one , too .
We want to see Tom do that .
She gave it to me .
Whoever is at the door , please ask him to wait .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
This is my sister , Mary .
You have nothing to worry about .
What Tom does is his own business .
Tom looked miserable .
Does Tom have any family ?
Tom gave everything he had .
What goes on in this room ?
It appears to me that you are right .
Thank you .
I still want to go .
What do we do with it ?
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom now lives in Boston .
Tom said that he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
I &apos;ll write to Tom again .
Tom has a thing for you .
Tom knows where Mary is .
I don &apos;t want you anymore .
I &apos;ll make it simple .
You &apos;re way too late .
What are you going to do with it ?
I would like to see Tom .
Why does Tom do things like that ?
Tom seems to like talking about himself .
I think everybody is ready .
There was almost nothing in the room .
He needs that money .
Did Tom fall ?
You can tell Tom not to worry .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
Tom could &apos;ve said something , but he didn &apos;t .
I want to talk to you about last night .
That should be enough .
I think we shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell Mary how old he was .
I want to hear more about Tom .
I know what Tom does here .
It &apos;s a big world .
It only happened once .
We &apos;re from here .
Tell me the truth .
It &apos;s difficult to please Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know I exist .
Tom is pretty much finished .
What do you want to hear ?
Tom had to wait .
Did it actually happen ?
How long are they ?
Do you want something to eat ?
I can &apos;t hear a word Tom is saying .
You have to help .
I &apos;m very sorry I did that .
I appreciate your coming all the way .
My mother is beautiful .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to talk about that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
May I ask about your family ?
Tom tells it like it is .
Are you , by any chance , scared of me ?
There &apos;s nothing to it .
I &apos;m here because I want to be .
We &apos;ll help you out .
I &apos;ll give you my opinion .
He must be Tom &apos;s brother .
They &apos;re coming again .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
Was that all you saw ?
I &apos;ve said all I have to say .
What &apos;s eating her ?
Tom is back in town .
Tom may not like what he sees .
We can do nothing about it .
Everyone &apos;s waiting .
He is not the boy who came here yesterday .
We &apos;ve got another three days .
Are you there ?
Tom will do that again tomorrow .
Did Tom say he left early ?
You are a woman .
What shall we do today ?
I enjoy being with you .
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
Tom was supposed to be at school today , but he wasn &apos;t .
Don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
That doesn &apos;t happen often .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here with us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how tall Mary is .
You &apos;d better go .
I &apos;ve got money .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
Tom isn &apos;t coming , either .
Did you meet her ?
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
There &apos;s very little we can do now .
Tom gave Mary a book .
I thought I could count on you .
I will go .
Tom and I don &apos;t always agree .
I didn &apos;t get much .
How long do you want to stay in Boston ?
You don &apos;t know a thing about me .
Tom came outside .
No one knows why .
Tom is just pretending .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I &apos;m not a woman .
Did Tom leave ?
I like being with Tom .
I want the other one .
I found this watch at the station .
I &apos;ll go back to Boston .
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
Tom has what Mary wants .
Tom always does that for me .
I &apos;m going to give it to you .
I &apos;m at home every evening .
We don &apos;t have all day .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
I will not be busy tomorrow .
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore .
We found Tom .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to do that .
Where is my watch ?
We &apos;re going alone .
How come this never happens to me ?
She must have done it yesterday .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
Tom hardly ever talks about his work .
I want to see how Tom lives .
That &apos;s mine , too .
I am tired of my work .
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
Tom is afraid of making mistakes .
I liked everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t want my help .
I hope Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
We both saw you .
Tom knew it was impossible .
Tom wanted Mary .
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
How old is your cat ?
You should go see a doctor .
You do look a little better today .
Tom is the one with the problem , not me .
What are you guys doing ?
I believe that it can be done .
Tom looks great .
He gave me this book .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know .
Tom is my dad .
I can only stay a few minutes .
Did you write this book ?
I have no problem with this .
I didn &apos;t hear it .
I like her very much .
How long have you been learning English ?
Tom and Mary are still there .
I like you just the way you are .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
You can go home now .
I love it !
Are we all ready ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let me leave .
I need his help .
I have hardly any money with me .
I met Tom .
Are you busy ?
You needn &apos;t do it at once .
I want more of that .
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t have any money .
I &apos;ve lost my friends .
We want to go home .
Tom wished he had a dog .
He left his wife .
Where is the train station ?
Tom returned from Australia yesterday .
I can swim very fast .
I know too much .
I want people to see it .
That girl isn &apos;t able to ride a bicycle .
Tom should really do that .
I don &apos;t think we have enough time .
May I see my girlfriend now ?
Where &apos;s my watch ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
Tom was here with Mary .
I don &apos;t even know if Tom is still alive .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to learn French .
I &apos;m not ready yet .
You can &apos;t stay here .
I cannot find time to read the book .
It looks good .
I &apos;ve been to Boston often enough .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
It might be Tom .
You didn &apos;t have to do it straight away .
You don &apos;t have to go to school today .
My room has two windows .
I have the house all to myself .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
I knew who he was .
Tom thought about Mary a lot .
Who is this woman ?
Tom never gave up .
Tom made Mary very happy .
Everybody is very busy .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
Are you in ?
I was just about to say that .
I told Tom why I wanted to do that .
She &apos;s got more books .
I have a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is happy or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
I &apos;d like a little more time .
Tom went back home .
We &apos;ve been together for three years .
Why didn &apos;t you buy any coffee ?
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
He may have been right .
Tom said Mary would come .
Tom wasn &apos;t there .
Where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
Do you want me to go now ?
I won &apos;t forget you , Tom .
You should know it .
This book belongs to you .
Is that your room ?
What my mother had said was true .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
He &apos;s not in .
How &apos;s the world treating you ?
Leave it alone .
Why did Tom do that ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
You must be Tom &apos;s mother .
That &apos;s never happened to us before .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
How much money do you have on you ?
Don &apos;t repeat that .
You don &apos;t have to do what Tom says .
Thank you for everything you have done for me .
You &apos;re welcome to stay .
She had no brother .
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early .
Can you hear it ?
I know why Tom &apos;s happy .
We have to do that .
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her .
Life is enjoyable .
I &apos;m late , aren &apos;t I ?
Tom is doing that for the money .
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
What &apos;s Tom look like ?
Why don &apos;t you go and have a look ?
This is what I &apos;m good at .
She &apos;s been working all day long .
You didn &apos;t have to do that .
They found us .
Tom told you something , didn &apos;t he ?
I think it was maybe Tom .
Tom said very little .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
We don &apos;t know whether to believe Tom or not .
Tom looks much better now .
I expect that he will help us .
He is absorbed in his work .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
I don &apos;t know how long I &apos;ll be gone .
Tell Tom the truth .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
We talk about it every day .
She said that she was ill .
She doesn &apos;t want him to go to Boston .
Tom really needs to tell Mary the truth .
Thank you for the book .
The people in the other room are speaking French .
Tom wanted to stay .
Nobody came .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;d do without Mary .
I asked Tom where he &apos;d been .
It may never happen again .
They know where we are .
Tom is sick .
Tom is currently living in Australia .
Do you know what these are ?
You don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
What &apos;s up ?
This man is very , very old .
I thought that Tom had done that for us .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
We &apos;ll have to live with that .
Don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did today .
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
What &apos;ll Tom do ?
I &apos;m sick .
I just wanted to see what it was like .
I &apos;ll be around back .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
We have one for you , too .
Did you like Boston ?
I don &apos;t know what that thing is .
That &apos;s not what I had intended to do .
Tom knows where I am .
Are you asking me for something ?
Is she your mother ?
Nobody wants Tom .
This isn &apos;t for Tom .
I am a teacher , too .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom yet .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
You know what I mean .
I know where you are .
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
I like English .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
Tom is at school , isn &apos;t he ?
Who speaks French ?
I like this dog .
Tom found one .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
That &apos;s the one we want .
They &apos;ve seen Tom .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
I can drive a car .
Is the job too much for you ?
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
Tom and I were both busy at that time .
Tom told Mary it wouldn &apos;t be easy .
I had nothing left to eat .
Tom didn &apos;t even know where he was .
It happens now and then .
I can &apos;t go on pretending like nothing happened .
I only have a few books .
Is it really true ?
Tom pretended to be a doctor .
I couldn &apos;t get him to do it .
Tom is old enough to go to school .
She dislikes going to school .
Who was it that gave you that ?
That &apos;s not what Tom wants to do .
Why doesn &apos;t he come back ?
They have come .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his son to turn out like me .
Let him do as he likes .
Mary isn &apos;t my sister .
She is looked up to by her friends .
We can talk about this later .
This is all that I know .
Where is everybody ?
I don &apos;t like the house he is living in .
Tom said he may do that .
Don &apos;t let go .
Do you want to see my cat ?
I saw Tom take it .
Is it done ?
There you are .
We &apos;re not happy with this .
Is that car yours ?
You know how .
Tom said he &apos;d be back soon .
I hope we &apos;ll find lots of it .
I can &apos;t see well .
We want you here .
I &apos;ve seen a lot .
How do you want to do this ?
These books aren &apos;t for children .
Let &apos;s go home , Tom .
I &apos;m from the city .
I &apos;ll meet with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to ever do that again .
I know you like me .
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
The day turned out to be fine .
I don &apos;t like school .
Did you see my father ?
This isn &apos;t real .
His son is ill .
We have enough food now .
Do you have one ?
Can you speak French ?
I asked Tom to come yesterday , but he didn &apos;t come .
I saw something I wished I hadn &apos;t seen .
He &apos;s getting old .
What are you guys planning ?
I will get it for you .
I &apos;m not very busy .
&quot; What &apos;s the matter with you ? &quot; she demanded .
I &apos;ll see you in Boston .
I want to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t want someone else . I want you .
I have to find it .
I &apos;m not taking Tom &apos;s word for it .
That &apos;s not going to be easy .
Let Tom buy what he wants .
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
Who ate ?
We know something about it .
You have done well .
I like that one .
How was your day today ?
You don &apos;t need that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French at all .
Studying French is a lot of fun .
He &apos;s feeling much better .
You eat more food than I do .
Tom can help me .
I was just having a little fun .
I never said it was going to be easy .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
They did what had to be done .
What does Tom want us to do ?
This is how Tom does it .
What a woman !
I &apos;m afraid for his life .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the past three days .
I don &apos;t want to study today .
I didn &apos;t see that .
Do you know about that ?
No one can help you .
I &apos;m beautiful .
I don &apos;t know why Tom needs that much money .
That &apos;s hard to believe .
He did it as he had been told .
I &apos;m going out with Tom .
Is this your book ?
French is difficult .
They get along like a cat and a dog .
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
Do you want to do it right now ?
I listened .
I just ate .
I would like to tell you something .
You don &apos;t have to be scared .
I just found it .
The bike &apos;s mine .
I have a question for you .
I don &apos;t think so .
That belongs to Tom .
Tom may do that here .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
I want to learn how to speak French .
Don &apos;t mention this to Tom .
I wish Tom could be here with us today .
Tom thought about this .
Tom isn &apos;t saying why .
I like this dog .
We &apos;ll do that .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
You can tell the truth .
Tom did it all .
What does that have to do with you ?
Tom asked her if she was Mary .
Tom has already finished the work .
Thank you for coming .
This book is too difficult for you to read .
I will help as much as I can .
I want Tom to leave .
You don &apos;t have to come .
They want to come .
Why did you tell Tom Mary didn &apos;t like him ?
Who gave this to Tom ?
How often do you eat out ?
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom .
I think Tom is here already .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
He was absent from school yesterday because he was sick .
You won &apos;t believe what I just saw .
Tom is busy right now .
I &apos;ll make Tom do it .
She knows nothing about your family .
I know that Tom knows .
Tom can &apos;t know the truth .
We don &apos;t need your money .
I can &apos;t help you .
Where &apos;s the money ?
Are you really sick ?
I had some fun .
I have been busy today .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
Tom wasn &apos;t there last week .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a girlfriend .
Everybody &apos;s here .
Can you really swim ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
I &apos;ll come alone .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
Tom told me to give you this .
I know about Tom and Mary .
What does Tom like to do that Mary doesn &apos;t like to do ?
Tom wants to work .
Aren &apos;t you going to study French ?
You &apos;re very busy .
What have we here ?
May I talk to you ?
I want my own room .
Tom asked Mary if she was free the next day .
Where are you now ?
Tom is quitting .
When you &apos;re a father , you &apos;ll understand .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
I didn &apos;t hear you .
Tom said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
I knew that .
I don &apos;t like doing that .
Tom has more questions .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
I think Tom is sick .
I &apos;m getting better every day .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
Tom knew better .
There &apos;s something under the bed .
There &apos;s someone at the door .
I &apos;m thinking about you .
Here comes the train .
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom that he didn &apos;t have to come .
Tom arrived yesterday .
My brother is a teacher .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
What &apos;s happening ?
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
Thank you for doing this .
I have a very good opinion of Tom .
You still have much to learn .
I am going to write a letter .
A cat has been on the table .
Tom &apos;s coming .
Can you see anything out there ?
What can I get you ?
Tom could be alone .
Have you seen my son ?
They got to be good friends .
This is a better house than the other one .
I think I ate a little too much today .
How do you say &quot; I love you &quot; in French ?
We aren &apos;t always right .
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
Tom is going to like doing that .
We were busy .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
I want to know about Tom .
My problem is I &apos;m too busy .
Everyone likes her .
My mom made it for me .
I didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with Tom .
I don &apos;t want to live this way .
I &apos;ve only done this once before .
I love being with Tom .
Are you alone right now ?
I want Tom to see these .
Why would I want to have dinner with Tom ?
Did Tom say why Mary isn &apos;t here today ?
They &apos;re there .
Has Tom gone , too ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom .
Tom said Mary is fine .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s brother .
She &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
I have to get Tom home .
I &apos;d rather not go to Boston with Tom .
Do you still have it ?
I can do this myself .
He can speak and write French .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
Are you through with this book ?
Give me that one .
Is that your sister ?
I &apos;m right .
He wanted to meet you .
You &apos;re sick !
As you like .
Tom got into bed .
Give me two minutes .
Tom wanted to learn how to swim .
Tom can &apos;t help me anymore .
Tom won &apos;t do it .
Have you found anything ?
Everyone knows I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
Tom said he has to go .
Who &apos;s better at French , Tom or Mary ?
I was up all night .
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know .
Tom asked Mary who her father was .
Did Tom say why ?
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
I am your father .
Did Tom say where Mary might be ?
I didn &apos;t want anything .
Tom had had enough .
Do you want Tom to do that for you ?
I dislike them all .
Tom is very happy here .
She looks very sick .
I am afraid I can &apos;t help you .
What has he done to you ?
Tom really enjoys his job .
He knows no English .
Tom gave us that .
I &apos;ll need your help .
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
He took me by the hand .
Tom came here by bicycle .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
These are our books .
I thought that , too .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
I have nothing to eat .
That happens all the time .
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
You may give the book to whoever wants it .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
That &apos;s what I told him .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to eat much .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see this .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the last three days .
I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom may not want to do that , but he should .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
I asked Tom to wait for me at the train station .
I have something for you .
He is always with me .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston with me ?
I &apos;m supposed to see Tom .
We have to be there .
It &apos;s really simple .
Do you have a wife ?
Can all your children speak French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like kids .
They were my friends .
Tom is lying ill in bed .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You did a really good job .
We can &apos;t just let Tom leave .
I didn &apos;t know what was happening .
I wish I had seen her .
Do you have enough money ?
It &apos;s white .
The food was very good .
Nobody wants you to do this .
He bought her a dog .
I need a new car .
It was here that I saw her .
Tom is almost never busy anymore .
I can live with that .
I &apos;m able to speak French .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for me .
Where are you ?
You can read this book .
I saw Tom this morning .
I won &apos;t let you out of my sight .
He &apos;s still at work .
Tom , you &apos;ll be here for me if I need you , won &apos;t you ?
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
That girl looks like her mother .
You have to believe in something .
Tom saw Mary swimming .
I wish I could live in Boston .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
What kind of car do you drive ?
We want to leave .
It cannot be true .
Tom didn &apos;t know anything about Mary .
You haven &apos;t seen Tom , have you ?
I think you &apos;re right .
Let Tom speak .
Tom is looking at us .
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
Tom wants way too much money .
That &apos;s none of your business .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word out of you .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s from your family .
How badly do you want it ?
We no longer need you .
Tom did that a lot .
They won &apos;t find you .
Both of us are from Australia .
I don &apos;t know your brother .
Tom and Mary have nothing to do .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
I don &apos;t know that yet .
We can &apos;t help you now .
I believe you .
How do we do that ?
Do you have enough time ?
I want to go to Boston with Tom .
We hardly see you anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
I saw nothing .
I &apos;ve got more money than Tom has .
When are you coming home ?
Tom was correct all along .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
When do you need it ?
I wish she could have come .
Where do you guys live ?
Give Tom the money .
I know that it &apos;s there .
I forget who said it .
I was on the bus .
You can &apos;t have both .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t very happy here .
Nothing ever happens around here .
Tom could barely speak .
It &apos;s time we went home .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
I don &apos;t see why Tom wanted me to be here today .
Leave the food on the table .
Can you direct me to the train station ?
Who has it now ?
How about tomorrow night ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I haven &apos;t heard anything .
What do you want with us ?
Why do you want to go ?
I think of her day and night .
I wish I was with you .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have to do anything .
I don &apos;t know whether I will have time to do it .
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
Could you repeat that , please ?
I will do as you say .
I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
Tom works at home .
Tom won &apos;t help .
Did you hear it too ?
I can &apos;t let you leave .
There &apos;s not enough water .
We &apos;ve been here for a while .
Tom let Mary do whatever she wanted to do .
What did you do this morning ?
We &apos;ll take this .
How big is your school ?
I don &apos;t want to leave Boston .
He is old enough to drive .
It &apos;s not true .
Tom has it .
You &apos;re so beautiful !
Tom was late .
You don &apos;t have to eat .
That &apos;s my mother .
Tom left his wife .
Does she have children ?
That car is Tom &apos;s .
It &apos;s not here .
You must hurry up .
Why are you at home ?
I don &apos;t like French .
It &apos;s too fast .
Tom and Mary have a second home .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
I &apos;ll see Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be able to work tomorrow .
Can this be it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like to work by himself .
We &apos;re a big family .
You should have listened to me .
Tom isn &apos;t from Boston .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
Do you know what they said ?
When do we have to do that ?
I make a good living .
Tom wanted to learn .
I &apos;m a father .
We &apos;ve got to do something .
I &apos;m a doctor .
Tom is playing with his cat .
Isn &apos;t life beautiful ?
We have a few questions for you .
You &apos;re a woman .
You know I love you !
I &apos;ll never forget what you told me .
Are you sure that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to be done ?
I &apos;ll go myself if I need to .
I can swim .
That &apos;s a good response .
Being with him always makes me happy .
He can do whatever he likes with the money .
I wish I &apos;d been there .
I &apos;ve been here almost three years now .
That &apos;s just not true .
Tom still wants to come .
This is my family .
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
You must do the work , even if you do not like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind .
You &apos;re not telling me the whole truth .
Tom would be a good teacher .
We both know what happened .
I &apos;m not supposed to talk to you .
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
Tom is already there .
I never want to hear his name again .
Where have you been ?
They won &apos;t help you .
I believe this is mine .
Are they your friends ?
What &apos;ll you do ?
You aren &apos;t me .
I don &apos;t have to go , but you do .
He was absent from school yesterday .
Tom is a man you can rely on .
Do you know what day it is today ?
Tom wants to go to Australia .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
Maybe Tom should study French .
I don &apos;t want to ever speak to you again .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid to speak French .
Who fell ?
I can &apos;t let Tom see me like this .
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy , does he ?
Is that your mother ?
Tom is bragging about his new car .
Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to .
Tom is at home .
He eats too much .
Where are they taking Tom ?
I still think about her from time to time .
Tom can speak French .
I think about you all the time .
Here &apos;s some water .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary .
Tom is going to be fine .
Don &apos;t mention it to Tom .
Did Tom say he needed to do that ?
I knew you &apos;d like that .
When do you need it by ?
She is working night and day .
When can we eat ?
Tom wondered whether he should let Mary go to Australia with John .
Maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
Maybe we ought to ask Tom .
When did you find this ?
Why aren &apos;t they back ?
I could never be like you .
Tom asked Mary to tell him where she &apos;d been .
Tom has work to do .
We go to school by bus .
You know what you have to do .
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
Tom isn &apos;t very happy , is he ?
What do you do ?
What do you want to hear from me ?
Let us go .
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
I think Tom knows why Mary isn &apos;t here .
I do not want to work .
We &apos;ve already eaten .
I still don &apos;t see it .
He is unable to do it .
Do you want to know why ?
Tom has lots of money .
I &apos;d like a word with you .
I &apos;d like to live in Australia .
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
Who is that ?
I feel sorry for her .
We know what needs to be done .
I &apos;ll ask Tom for you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
I believe Tom can do that .
How long have they been here ?
Tom is likely to be right .
I know both of the girls .
He &apos;s just showing off in front of the girls .
I was home all night .
Tom often talks to his dog .
I considered Tom .
You have to leave Boston .
Tom is not very good at French .
Where shall we meet ?
This looks great .
You don &apos;t need to study today .
She &apos;s not as beautiful as her sister .
He can &apos;t be ill .
Just give me what I want .
We can get what we want without your help .
Tom knows what we &apos;re doing .
Tom said he just needed more time .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t have any children .
Tom was gone for three days .
What time do you want to meet tomorrow ?
What do you people do ?
This is a daily occurrence .
I might ask Tom what happened .
He did not want her to leave .
I went to Tom &apos;s house after school .
I haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
Nobody knows what has become of him .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
Tom looks much better now .
I know where Tom will be three hours from now .
I want to do something with my life .
I &apos;m not that old .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait that long .
He wants to go .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom that .
When were you in Boston ?
The cat is under the bed .
I can &apos;t keep my eyes off of it .
How long have you been in this town ?
Tom never said a word .
That house belongs to him .
Tom has something he wants to say to you .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
Tom isn &apos;t very good-looking .
Are these yours ?
He left after me .
If you want to , we &apos;ll go .
Tom is still on the job .
Tom has enough time .
Are these books yours or mine ?
That was all Tom said .
We &apos;re busy , Tom .
I &apos;ll talk .
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
It &apos;s all I need .
I like you .
He was made to wait at the station for two hours .
I don &apos;t like him .
I love my dad .
She can speak French .
I need Tom now .
What if Tom doesn &apos;t do that ?
I would rather you hadn &apos;t told him the truth .
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
Tom is now up .
Are you Tom ?
Tom kept me waiting for a long time .
I did exactly what I said I would do .
What are you wearing ?
What have you ever done for us ?
I don &apos;t know what that is .
That &apos;s how Tom likes it .
Tom lives above me .
Where &apos;s your school ?
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
Let it be .
How can Tom not understand that ?
Tom asked Mary for help .
I know exactly where you are .
We &apos;re supposed to be together .
Things don &apos;t just happen .
I can wait for you .
Tom said that he &apos;d help me .
It &apos;s none of our business .
I &apos;ll do anything for you .
She has a few books .
Are you happy ?
This is one of mine .
Tom is in Boston with his parents .
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can .
Tom needs our help .
You must go to school .
Tom is still in bed .
I &apos;ll come tomorrow .
We have to do something to stop this from happening again .
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you . Thank you .
Tom says he was busy .
Tom asked why .
I don &apos;t know the way .
Tom always leaves for school too late .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you could speak French ?
Does Mary have a boyfriend , yet ?
Don &apos;t leave me alone .
Let &apos;s play something .
Tom found me a good job .
Do you two want to be alone ?
I think you can do better than that .
What happened out there ?
Tom &apos;s parents weren &apos;t home .
I want you to be happy .
I think you should swim .
I &apos;m not certain .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
I have done what I could .
I love them both .
They have lived in this town for ten years .
Who found her ?
I know what you did .
What was the response ?
They are very old .
We have two kids .
Tom didn &apos;t see a thing .
Tom is not fast enough .
I can hardly find time to do that anymore .
I can &apos;t go .
Tom comes to school by bus and train .
When did you get home ?
I didn &apos;t want this to happen .
Tom has left for good .
Tom is like family .
There &apos;s not much happening here .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
We &apos;re so busy .
There is a lot of money .
I think it &apos;s good .
He can &apos;t help you .
Everybody was tired .
We have only two dollars .
It &apos;s not for me to say .
I &apos;m very tired now .
Tom won &apos;t live long .
What does this do ?
I like English better .
Please tell me the answer to the question .
That &apos;s what Tom likes to do .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
Tom needs a job .
I barely know you .
They want me .
Don &apos;t ask me what it was .
Why can &apos;t you go now ?
If you want , you can go .
What do we have here ?
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
Tom isn &apos;t old enough to understand this .
Why is it there ?
Can you swim at all ?
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
I &apos;m supposed to wait for Tom .
I prefer not to talk about it .
We haven &apos;t got all day .
We &apos;re dating .
How &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
I know him by name .
Can I say something ?
You aren &apos;t alone .
Did you figure this out on your own ?
I &apos;ll give you this book .
It &apos;s not unheard of .
I need to talk to him .
I thought it might be true .
Nobody is doing anything .
What did you do yesterday evening ?
I &apos;ll be leaving now .
There are a lot of people who can &apos;t do that .
Tom might wait .
We haven &apos;t heard from Tom in a long time .
Tom scarcely said a word .
&quot; I am a teacher . &quot; &quot; So am I. &quot;
Nobody knows where he lives .
Tom knows what this is .
Do you really want to talk about that now ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
You &apos;re always busy .
I was really scared .
How did you make it ?
Please teach me how to do that .
Tom gave Mary a watch .
You need to leave .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
I &apos;m not busy either .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
I like this book .
You need not do it at once .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
There &apos;s something on the table .
Do you have anything further to say ?
I can &apos;t hear Tom .
Tom is really busy .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
I wish I had more to give you .
Why is Tom so busy ?
Nothing has to be done .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother ?
I have a lot of work to do today .
I &apos;ve got time .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
Tom &apos;s parents are John and Mary .
Tom is here in Boston with me .
I thought you said Tom was your brother .
Tom couldn &apos;t forget Mary even if he wanted to .
Tom saw it , too .
You must believe me .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
Tom didn &apos;t give us any money .
I don &apos;t want to eat anything .
Tom wants to wait .
How did you find me ?
Thanks for dropping by .
I have known her for two years .
When do I get to go home ?
Tom might not be in Australia anymore .
Tom says he &apos;s not going .
I need a little more time .
Tom wanted to talk to you .
Tom looked very good .
Why don &apos;t you want to tell us the truth ?
This is my sister .
I have what you want .
Please give me one .
We can help Tom .
What &apos;s Tom got against me ?
How &apos;s your job going ?
She asked him for help .
That &apos;s my cat .
Can you come back later ?
Is that all we need ?
We have a lot of things that need to be done .
Did you hear about Tom and Mary ?
When did you buy it ?
Where is your friend ?
I haven &apos;t gotten around to doing that yet .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
We have no money .
When did they leave ?
Tom made his bed .
I &apos;ll do as you say .
Make the time to do it .
Do you know something about this ?
I &apos;ll be with Tom .
That house is big .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
No one came with me .
I wonder what Tom is doing .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that .
Nobody went there .
We &apos;re just pretending .
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
Tom needs help now .
We don &apos;t want that , do we ?
How do you like Australia ?
Tom and Mary are there with John now .
Tom considered the question .
Tom looked at me like I was crazy .
They look good .
This letter &apos;s for me .
I was away for a year .
I think Tom wants to stay .
When did you go to bed last night ?
I crossed the street .
Is that your house ?
Tom has no money .
I shouldn &apos;t worry .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
Why were you late ?
When will you return ?
Did you enjoy it ?
I wish that I could help you .
I know what this is about .
We &apos;ve been up all night .
You must come with me .
Tom told Mary that she was right .
Tom couldn &apos;t find a job .
Who &apos;s here ?
I had better ask them .
I &apos;m coming for you , Tom .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
I know that Tom was right .
I want to ask you something .
Is it really you ?
Tom isn &apos;t where he wants to be .
What is it you need ?
I know what you want to do .
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
That &apos;s a problem .
I don &apos;t know what you want to do .
I don &apos;t want to say anything .
Tom is like that .
There is always something happening here .
You &apos;re going to like this .
I don &apos;t know if it is good .
I will do what I need to do .
I think I know why Tom didn &apos;t do that .
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to do that .
Tom tried .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this .
I don &apos;t know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Your French is hard to understand .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do anything to help .
What I need is more time .
Tom is never at home .
This is their house .
I don &apos;t have that .
Tom looked around to make sure they were alone .
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
I didn &apos;t know you had a cat .
What exactly did you do ?
I don &apos;t like that .
What are you and Tom doing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that right away .
We &apos;ll help you .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
Is this your bicycle ?
I need to know .
You can &apos;t bring your cat to school .
You can go if you want to .
That belongs to us .
I wrote it for Tom .
I have a job for you .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
That &apos;s what I want to do .
Tom can &apos;t stay long .
They had only one child .
I cannot eat anything today .
I should go now .
You can &apos;t leave now .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Is there anyone here ?
They enjoy playing together .
My brother speaks very quickly .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I will be back soon .
This is better .
I hope we don &apos;t have to wait for too long .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston .
What is she like ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
Tom is history .
I know why you &apos;re here .
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
Who would do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is busy or not .
You can &apos;t believe a word of it .
She asked me for help .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
He lives above me .
Tom and Mary have a son .
It &apos;s time to put the children to bed .
How old are your children now ?
What does Tom say ?
I thought it was really good .
This is the girl that came yesterday .
Tom was here .
There &apos;s not enough coffee .
That &apos;s how we do it in Boston .
Tom can speak French better than Mary .
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
My parents don &apos;t know where I am .
That was really fun .
What are your plans for today ?
They &apos;ve never met .
I know the girl .
It &apos;s simple .
It wasn &apos;t difficult to understand .
If I &apos;d wanted to go , I would &apos;ve said so .
Thanks for meeting me .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen you around here before .
We tell each other everything .
He went to school only for a few years .
Tom had his palm read .
My children don &apos;t listen to me .
You saw what Tom did , didn &apos;t you ?
No one has heard Tom say Mary &apos;s name .
Tom knows why Mary is in Boston .
I saw how Tom was doing that .
Are you still at home ?
I don &apos;t like it at all .
You &apos;ve done a great job .
He &apos;s afraid of making mistakes .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that tomorrow .
What &apos;s in front of you ?
You need not do it at once .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
We just don &apos;t know why .
My father may be at home now .
We &apos;re already old .
They took off after Tom .
I can &apos;t tell what it is .
She is not to blame .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a long time .
I want to find Tom .
You &apos;re going to be a good father .
We require your help .
She &apos;s not my girlfriend .
Tom kept pacing .
We need to speak with you .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
This is what we want to know .
Tom stopped reading .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
You have a car , don &apos;t you ?
Thanks for being here .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know anything .
This is my home .
Tom &apos;s got a tremendous amount of work to do .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
I think it would be a mistake to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
Tom left without saying a word .
How long have you had this problem ?
I would do that right now if I were you .
I think I won &apos;t do that .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom all week .
Is he tall ?
He made his parents happy .
I didn &apos;t have time for that .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
Who is that man ?
Are you Tom ?
I love going to Boston .
They are good people .
I think about her often .
Tom is coming .
I like to be around people .
Do you have a child ?
I need you .
Tom isn &apos;t eating .
He talks well .
Tom lost .
I want to know what &apos;s going on out here .
I think we &apos;ve seen enough .
You can &apos;t help Tom .
He was sick last week .
I can &apos;t drive Tom to school today .
I think that what you need now is to eat something .
Tom wants to go to Japan .
I want to go , too .
I no longer love him .
Tom never raises his voice .
My children are at school .
Tom is too old for you .
Do we have one ?
We don &apos;t live here .
Tom is right .
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week .
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom is there , too .
Let &apos;s eat out .
You guys are always so busy .
When did you go to bed last night ?
I saw her for the last time .
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago .
We &apos;ll go .
This book is heavy .
I can &apos;t see a thing .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
I don &apos;t want to know his name .
Tom is only pretending that he doesn &apos;t know .
They want this .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s father .
Tom could be telling the truth .
I would ask him if I were you .
When will it begin ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Are you busy ?
I know I &apos;m good enough .
That &apos;s quite a story .
Give me my money back .
I don &apos;t go swimming as often as I used to .
What are you wearing ?
We &apos;re not going .
I want to know how you did it .
We must work as long as we live .
Tom is going to be a father soon .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to me ?
Help !
I never want to see your face again .
Tom isn &apos;t a very good man .
Why don &apos;t you go home early today ?
Can you take me home now ?
You &apos;re late again .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a sister .
Why won &apos;t Tom help us ?
Where are your friends going ?
What are they going to do to me ?
Mary is a mother .
I don &apos;t have enough .
That is your book .
She is always busy .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
Have you finished yet ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
What did you do there ?
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom is hard to please .
I love you people .
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
I need something to eat .
I &apos;d like to help you , but I &apos;m a bit busy right now .
Tom saw something .
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
Tom should be in bed .
You were never alone .
Tom and Mary were the last two to leave .
You &apos;re standing in my way .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
I hope not .
I simply don &apos;t believe you .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us that he didn &apos;t know how to swim ?
I don &apos;t want to get into the water .
You don &apos;t have to be alone anymore .
How is the family doing ?
Tom can &apos;t leave just yet .
You know why I left .
I know your brother very well .
We have a few questions for you .
You missed .
What if someone sees us ?
Tom has always wanted to do that .
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
I can &apos;t tell you what happened .
I &apos;ve got to go now .
I started working .
Something happened .
Who &apos;s going to believe that ?
He does not live there any more .
You were late for work .
I can hardly swim .
I need more .
Tom and I are almost the same height .
That &apos;s not an answer .
Why would I tell you ?
Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow .
What do you mean by that ?
Do you have it ?
Tom may do whatever he wants to .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
I never saw her again .
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
I &apos;m for that .
I would like to meet him .
They know who you are .
If you don &apos;t believe me , ask Tom .
Tom talks too fast .
What does he mean to do ?
I know what Tom would say .
Is somebody out there ?
I think you did a great job .
Tom and Mary are doing fine .
I need some time to myself .
No one &apos;s going to see us .
Tom has already left .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word about it !
Where am I going to go ?
Tom told Mary he wasn &apos;t busy .
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
Where can we meet you ?
Tom said that he was very busy .
What are you going to do here ?
Is it a boy or a girl ?
I don &apos;t know if I still have it .
Tom will wait .
Who found Tom ?
Tom quickly closed the door .
I can &apos;t give you that .
Tell us the truth , Tom .
I need help .
That &apos;s what we do .
I think we have enough money .
Would you like to see it now ?
She has a few books .
It &apos;s here .
I don &apos;t think I can wait that long .
Tom does not look happy .
I don &apos;t know why he was late .
What do Tom and Mary do ?
You &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
What actually happened ?
She wouldn &apos;t be happy with him .
They know who he is .
Tom wanted money .
Did Tom find it ?
I can scarcely believe it .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
I don &apos;t have that much money .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
He says he met my father .
I can &apos;t do that now .
Tom has to do that tomorrow .
I think Tom knew .
No one has seen Tom .
I said what had to be said .
I don &apos;t care what you do .
Can you stay a bit longer ?
I bought a house .
Tom has a lot of friends .
Tom knows how to drive a car .
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
Tom has nothing to do .
I don &apos;t know that .
You should ask Tom first .
My brother is out .
Tom isn &apos;t busy .
I can &apos;t understand you .
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
Life is fun .
He did not know what to say .
Tom prefers speaking French .
Tom was late for work .
I know nothing about him .
Tom knew what Mary knew .
Tom knows what Mary did .
Tom hardly ever works anymore .
I might not like it .
I &apos;m going to tell Tom the truth .
I can &apos;t believe I didn &apos;t even think of that .
I don &apos;t have many friends .
I didn &apos;t want to do it again .
You can do whatever you want to .
I &apos;m not going to make the same mistake again .
The world is not what it used to be .
We want to get out of here .
Does Tom know how to do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t get up early .
What does Tom want to know ?
I &apos;ve got to get Tom home .
I didn &apos;t know she was ill .
Haven &apos;t you done anything yet ?
I &apos;m really sorry everything happened the way it did .
Tom enjoys school .
You don &apos;t need to go .
The world is a big place .
Tom really speaks French well .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
Tom only has eyes for Mary .
Tom still hasn &apos;t found a good job .
Tom knows everything .
He asked me if I was busy .
Do you have everything ?
Just don &apos;t say anything .
We ate together .
They &apos;re friends .
Tom has been to Boston only once .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
We don &apos;t want to do this .
I think Tom and Mary are right .
That &apos;s exactly what I want to hear .
I &apos;m going because I want to .
He asked me what was the matter with me .
You can stay with us .
Tom just might get better .
It has nothing to do with me .
Tom talks fast .
Tom doesn &apos;t have long to live .
I forgot that Tom spoke French .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
You know what needs to be done .
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as I am .
What is there to understand ?
Give it to me , please .
They &apos;ve done it before .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you .
Tom lives in Boston .
It &apos;s good to be here .
Tom avoided Mary .
He pretended not to hear me .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Mary .
I didn &apos;t see him .
Can we please leave now ?
I &apos;ll never leave you alone again .
Maybe he will be a good teacher .
It &apos;s not up to you .
Do you have any more questions ?
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
We plan to stay a week .
Tom is leaving now .
How &apos;s the water ?
Eat everything .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
I haven &apos;t even told my wife .
What shall we buy with that money ?
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
I &apos;m feeling fine , thanks .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you ever again .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I already knew that .
I don &apos;t like what he said .
Is she gone ?
What are you going to be doing with that ?
What &apos;s your location ?
Those children are waiting for their mother .
Hand me the letter .
We didn &apos;t have school today .
Tom is a tall man .
I want nothing to do with it .
Tell me what I need to know .
No one was watching .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
Tom said he &apos;s not doing it .
It &apos;s early .
You should go home .
It &apos;s morning .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
It looks very good .
Tom told me he would go to Boston .
Nobody had anything else to say .
You should come .
There &apos;s nothing left to be done .
They &apos;re in the car .
You &apos;re always welcome here , Tom .
You can &apos;t help me .
You &apos;re a problem .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
I can &apos;t study at home .
Is your mom at home ?
Tom will know .
I don &apos;t want to eat this .
Tom didn &apos;t give up .
Tom walked away .
You work too much .
What &apos;s going on with you , Tom ?
If you really want to know , all you need to do is ask .
Do you wanna talk ?
Do you know what this says ?
You ought to know better .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
You &apos;re a good mother .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend .
I think Tom knows where Mary lives .
I wanted to do that last week , but didn &apos;t have the time .
Tom would leave .
I think Tom likes you .
I want to know why you &apos;re here .
Tom is still looking out the window .
That &apos;s not what I wanted hear .
I need you .
Why don &apos;t you understand ?
Tom quickly realized his error .
Can you be sure ?
Tom didn &apos;t come back .
Tom gave up .
This looks good .
The answer is simple .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom to do that ?
Tom is working on it .
Do you want to talk ?
I heard it .
I don &apos;t have a boyfriend .
I love this car .
I just wanted to see what would happen .
They don &apos;t get it .
We can &apos;t help Tom .
I think Tom can help you .
Why is Tom even here ?
Don &apos;t you want Tom to do that for you ?
What &apos;s your opinion on that ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom will come or not .
The boy takes after his father .
Ask Tom what he &apos;s done .
I saw her last week .
I know a little French .
What did Tom just say to you ?
You don &apos;t have to say that .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
They are all very happy .
We have to go .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in the city .
If you want to stay , you may .
I like it when Tom does that .
Tom looks like John .
I saw her yesterday .
I didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
We &apos;d better go help Tom .
Let me go !
I can &apos;t hear you .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom do that .
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Do you know something I don &apos;t know ?
Tom left a few minutes ago .
Tom is very fast .
Why &apos;s Tom so good at French ?
We still need your help .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
You &apos;d better not eat too much .
This is on you .
I &apos;ve heard that .
I completely forgot about that .
We &apos;re doing nothing .
I &apos;ve had a busy day .
She has never seen him .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
That &apos;s my problem with Tom .
Do you have enough food ?
You are not our friend .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
How many times have I told you ?
I have food .
It &apos;s not very good .
I went to school yesterday .
I don &apos;t know what to do with this .
I think Tom said he was from Boston .
Do you want to take one ?
Tom never came home .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to say .
What did you do in Boston ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom at school ?
What do you know about Boston ?
You &apos;re a good father .
He did it willingly .
How do you feel about it ?
I &apos;ll be with you .
Tom never saw Mary .
He gave him a book .
How many did you get ?
Here is your book .
Tom is looking at you .
Tom is often late for school .
Tom will go .
I intended to go , but forgot to .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me anything about it ?
She needs him more than he needs her .
Tom &apos;s story had a happy ending .
I &apos;m sorry for what I did .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
You &apos;re too late .
What have you ever done for us ?
Tom and Mary are sick .
Can you please help me ?
He is something like his father .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
He isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I know what Tom said .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
Does Tom have it ?
He hardly ever works .
I &apos;m going again tomorrow .
Can Tom walk ?
I &apos;ll go by car .
You better buy that book .
We know you have it .
I feel fine .
I have one .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Boston .
Why do we have to do it ?
He can be relied on .
Are you sick ?
How could I help you ?
I saw Tom with Mary .
You don &apos;t need that .
How do we get rid of Tom ?
What did Tom just tell you ?
That &apos;s what I thought you said .
I want to tell her the truth .
Is it always like this ?
Tom went home .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell Mary the truth ?
Did Tom like it in Boston ?
Let &apos;s do that again .
Tom will leave soon .
Can you handle it ?
Tom has three kids now .
I was outdoors .
You know where it is , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
She requested help , but no one came .
We all want you to be happy .
When Tom &apos;s happy , I &apos;m happy .
Tom said Mary may do that .
That can &apos;t be it .
What we need is help .
What &apos;s Tom do ?
Why do they do that ?
Aren &apos;t you from here ?
I want some money .
I received a letter written in English .
This is very simple .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
I like this answer .
Everybody &apos;s here .
I &apos;d like a cup of coffee , please .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go to bed .
Tom never made it home .
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
I know that Tom works very hard .
He has a car .
Tom , I want to go to sleep .
I &apos;d like to spend more time with my family .
We don &apos;t want this one .
Why are you really here ?
We &apos;ve got time .
That &apos;s what I heard .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
Tom will be working at home tomorrow .
Tom tires easily .
How many children do you have ?
Where are your children now ?
We are good friends .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
We were worried .
None of us plan to do that .
You three seem to want something .
You should be a teacher .
Tom is going to be a teacher .
I have something to tell you .
I won &apos;t assist you .
They are eating just now .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to do that ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
I like it out here .
Tom was very busy all day .
Tom is in Boston now .
You may go if you choose .
I wish Tom was here with us today .
I love you a lot .
Tom was tired .
Life isn &apos;t easy .
I can &apos;t understand Tom .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
Tom &apos;s dog is white .
I saw it , too .
Tom came by bus .
I would rather stay at home .
I have friends .
I &apos;ll do whatever I have to do .
You really don &apos;t need to do that .
This bicycle belongs to my brother .
I did it the way he told me to .
Tom and Mary were also there .
Tom told me that he wasn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
Do you know what it was ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to .
That man is Tom .
Has he arrived yet ?
I believe that Tom can do that .
She didn &apos;t want to get involved .
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
That &apos;s no good , Tom .
Tom does know that .
That &apos;s very simple .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
I bought the book for ten dollars .
No one will believe Tom .
You &apos;ll get it .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
Tom was just about to leave .
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
I have a big family .
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
We &apos;ll see how it goes .
I didn &apos;t know that he was there .
We never get enough to eat .
Did you find Tom or not ?
You should do that right away .
Tom will never see you again .
I know how to do that .
I know your father .
No one listened to me .
Where did you see that woman ?
Do you want to study with me ?
I &apos;m not always busy .
I &apos;m all right .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any plans for tomorrow .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
We &apos;ve done nothing .
I have no time to see you .
I &apos;ll be going with you .
Are you certain about this ?
I have to speak with Tom .
Why is Tom there ?
He is very fast .
I don &apos;t know what has happened to him .
Tom hasn &apos;t been home yet .
Tom shouldn &apos;t always believe what others say .
I &apos;ll have to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants .
Tom will be back in three hours .
She lives alone in this room .
Did you hear what Tom said about Mary ?
Listen , I need your help .
She gave him some food .
I don &apos;t know who the man is .
What are you going to make ?
We often hear French being spoken here .
I won &apos;t be able to eat all that by myself .
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston .
Tom hasn &apos;t found Mary yet .
I &apos;m going to have to go home early today .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom right now .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
We still need more time .
Is it there ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
Tom never would &apos;ve said that .
Who &apos;s that ?
When do we want it ?
He &apos;s going to love this .
It belongs to us .
I can &apos;t make out what she wants .
I don &apos;t want to live with that .
He was alone .
I need the truth .
I &apos;ll do what you want .
I &apos;ve been busy this week .
Can we leave now ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home .
I saw Tom &apos;s father .
Who wrote this story ?
I have no time to help you with the work .
Tom needs a friend .
That can &apos;t be true .
We all know .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
I think I know where Tom is .
Maybe she won &apos;t come .
If Tom had seen anything , he would have told us .
You know where Tom is .
I don &apos;t have a problem .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything .
We need to go .
Tom seems to be very happy to be here .
I think Tom would tell the truth .
We became good friends .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
I hope we &apos;ll never have to do that again .
We found it here .
You can do that tomorrow .
Tom &apos;s car is gone .
I said I &apos;m fine .
What does he want to do ?
I am in the house .
Tom will arrive soon .
Don &apos;t admit anything .
Tom is much better today than he was yesterday .
I think you can handle it .
He has come from Boston .
He took her by the hand .
Tom wants to be here .
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow .
That &apos;s true too , isn &apos;t it ?
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
Tom chickened out .
We can &apos;t trust what she says .
Tom didn &apos;t try to do anything .
We &apos;re too late .
I know you want to see Tom .
Tom has been pretending .
I really want to know what &apos;s going on here .
Tom is far better today than he was yesterday .
I hope to see you soon .
I want you to be here .
I &apos;ve heard this story before .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
I think that it &apos;s true .
Give me the book .
You &apos;re afraid of him .
