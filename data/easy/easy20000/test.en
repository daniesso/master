I was at home .
We &apos;ll wait .
Did you like Boston ?
I &apos;m really sorry about that .
Tom is happy again .
You can &apos;t buy anything if you have no money .
You are not a child any more .
We &apos;re still very busy .
Did you see it ?
Tom is a dear friend .
Tom has my book .
Tom became very sick .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
You like it , don &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t tell Tom .
He is afraid of making mistakes .
I know you know .
When does Tom have to do that ?
How &apos;s it going with you and Tom ?
It &apos;s time you went to bed .
If you don &apos;t want to do it for Tom , then do it for me .
How does Tom do that ?
My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English .
I wish I could have spoken more English .
I knew that Tom was from Boston .
I wanted to meet you .
Tom isn &apos;t seeing Mary .
What was it that you gave him ?
He will soon be a father .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
I have the feeling that my French isn &apos;t getting much better .
Tom has been there for three years .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
May I leave this book with you ?
Why do I have to do that ?
No one likes it .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
How was school today ?
I have to ask you about Tom .
No one can know everything .
Why is Tom out here ?
How long does it take to get from here to the station ?
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
Did you find a doctor ?
Tom &apos;s sorry .
All the food was gone .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as Mary .
Tom wants to be like me .
I shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
Tom came home .
Tom found that .
Tom wants Mary to be happy .
I like this house as it is .
May I go home now ?
He wanted to come with us .
Tom knows we know it .
Tom and I aren &apos;t going to study together this evening .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
I should &apos;ve been there with you .
Tom is ill .
I have a lot of money .
We aren &apos;t alone .
There he is .
They know who you are .
Both Tom and Mary want to study French .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
This &apos;ll help .
He has already gone home .
That &apos;s the one we want .
There &apos;s something here that Tom should see .
I &apos;m not your girlfriend .
How does Tom do it ?
Give this to Tom .
There &apos;s a letter for you .
Tom got that bicycle from Mary .
Tom was busy .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know .
Why are you talking like that ?
Tom speaks French as well as Mary .
Tom and Mary are John &apos;s children .
I &apos;m going to do that .
I know what I &apos;d do .
They were friends .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to leave .
Why did he do such a thing ?
I didn &apos;t write that .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell you anything .
I can &apos;t do any more .
This should be fun .
This car is fast .
I was trying to talk to you .
I have almost no money with me .
We can wait .
I hope Tom is unafraid .
What do you want to do ?
Is that all Tom told you ?
How long do I have to wait for the next bus ?
What &apos;s this ?
He doesn &apos;t know English .
I will give it to you .
She needs our help .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
Maybe Tom will know what to do .
Tom looked tired , but happy .
Thank you for telling me .
I know Tom better than he knows himself .
How long has she been sick ?
You &apos;re the woman I love .
Where &apos;s my wife ?
What are you doing tonight ?
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
There is more .
I &apos;ll meet him tomorrow .
She must have been very beautiful .
I closed my door .
I want to go to school .
I don &apos;t know whether to tell Tom or not .
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to school ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s doing now .
The only thing we can do is wait .
I know you have to go back to Boston .
I know what I said .
Tom wants to be with us .
She didn &apos;t have much money .
I &apos;m going outside .
Tom does that , too .
Did you give it to Tom ?
Maybe you should ask Tom .
That ended better than I expected .
Tom is still in Australia .
It &apos;ll be hard to find someone to do that .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
I don &apos;t know English .
Are you out of work ?
This is just too much .
What is it , Tom ? What &apos;s wrong ?
She made him happy .
The house belongs to him .
What are you going to say to Tom ?
He is my brother .
The others are playing outside .
Do you have any children ?
Do you know why ?
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so happy .
This job is too much for me .
I believe you .
He &apos;s looking at you .
I am tired of hearing it .
When did you come to Japan ?
No one wants to talk to Tom anymore .
Tom may not want to do that .
Maybe Tom can do it .
Tom is doing what he has to do .
I don &apos;t know how I did this .
I know your son .
They &apos;re very happy .
You don &apos;t want me here , do you ?
Tom and I are teachers .
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
I &apos;d love to see them .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to me .
I &apos;ll do what Tom says .
Why can &apos;t we just go home ?
It &apos;ll have to wait .
Did you see Tom leave ?
I &apos;m going to leave school .
Tom has left us .
I know you have it with you .
The dog likes you .
Nobody was listening .
I don &apos;t think Tom speaks French .
Tom looked around the room .
I believe in you .
I don &apos;t mind doing it .
This is my dog .
Tom can &apos;t work tonight .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
Tom didn &apos;t go home .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told me what to do .
We barely had time to do everything that had to be done .
What would you have said ?
I was just joking .
Tom will likely be right .
What do you want to do in Boston ?
You shouldn &apos;t eat here .
I forgot to ask Tom .
How are things with you ?
Tom can &apos;t hear anything .
If you &apos;d prefer , we can speak French .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
When are you going to do that ?
They &apos;ll find me .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
I want to tell you one thing more .
I can do this .
I want a girlfriend .
Tom and Mary are happy together .
It &apos;s one o &apos;clock .
Tom says he isn &apos;t giving up .
What are these ?
I &apos;d like to have dinner with you .
I don &apos;t know them at all .
How tall is he ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
Tom told me you need help .
Thank you for seeing me .
I want to hear you say it .
I &apos;ve been told that often enough .
This is my brother , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to wait for Mary .
The girl wanted to tell him the truth , but she couldn &apos;t .
Perhaps Tom left .
You have to believe in yourself .
He looks a bit tired .
She looks like her mother .
I think I remember how to do that .
Is Tom around ?
I think he &apos;s correct .
That &apos;s for sure .
Tom is all alone .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed yet .
Tom wants Mary to know he likes her a lot .
Don &apos;t you know what to do ?
He has to stay in bed .
We want a car .
That &apos;s a very good question .
I know what you said .
That doesn &apos;t belong to us .
We &apos;re good at it .
I made that for Tom .
I believe I have now told you everything .
I had no idea what to do .
Tom wasn &apos;t like that .
Let &apos;s go swimming .
Tom did do that .
He &apos;s on his last legs .
Have you been busy recently ?
This is your dog .
Who saw you ?
How is this possible ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom in the car ?
How do they do that ?
I hope you know what this is .
She has a few friends .
That &apos;s your problem .
Is this book yours ?
Tom , it doesn &apos;t work that way .
I &apos;ve got a few questions .
I &apos;ll be late to work .
What was that ?
Tom wants to work for Mary .
Is Tom still here ?
I still need your help .
I need many books .
We &apos;re a little busy right now .
I don &apos;t believe you .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
Tom made three errors .
It &apos;s always a pleasure to talk with Tom .
If I &apos;d only listened to my parents !
Tom is cooperating .
I can stay .
Tom was wondering if Mary had a boyfriend .
Were you telling the truth ?
Are you sure about this ?
How do you like this town ?
What did you buy ?
I let the cat out of the house .
I would rather have a cat than a dog .
How could that happen ?
You can tell Tom yourself .
Tom has my car .
Boston is where I want to be .
Where are your kids ?
We sure don &apos;t want that .
Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
He never said it again .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
We &apos;re home .
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
You want me to go , don &apos;t you ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew how to speak French ?
This isn &apos;t money .
Tom would like to buy a house in Boston .
When did you get this ?
Where &apos;s your car , Tom ?
No one can understand your letter .
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
I &apos;m very happy with it .
Tom and Mary want to see you .
Tom and I are very busy just now .
Did you see Tom leave ?
The man and the woman are eating outdoors .
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
You can &apos;t go .
I need to have a talk with you .
I am very happy .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;s beautiful .
Where do you really live ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
I can &apos;t do it now .
I am tired of my work .
I only hope it is not too late .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house .
He could not swim .
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom gives us everything we need .
Where can I find Tom ?
Is that a boy or a girl ?
I think Tom needs me .
He will come tomorrow .
I have already finished reading this book .
I want to talk to him about it .
I know almost nothing about it .
He doesn &apos;t know English .
Aren &apos;t you feeling well ?
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
Tom is not always busy .
That &apos;s how we do things .
I &apos;ll give you a book .
I am seeing a friend tomorrow .
We can &apos;t just act as if nothing has happened .
Tom gives us everything we want .
Tom will soon become a father .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
We &apos;re all going .
We have to find it before Tom does .
Tom will do that tomorrow , too .
Nobody can know everything .
Tom came .
This is none of your business .
I can &apos;t take you to work with me .
I &apos;ll tell you how to do it .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
Did Tom find it ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
The house is owned by him .
Who told Tom that ?
We &apos;ve got a long night ahead of us .
I thought Tom would like to know .
I like both .
I must go right away .
I have nothing to say to Tom .
The tall man came out of the house .
I know his family .
You &apos;ve made a mistake .
Nobody lives in this house .
I want him to leave .
Tom and Mary told John .
Let Tom do this .
I have enough money to buy it .
Tom does nothing but play all day .
Nobody wants him to come .
Tom may do that .
I like my job very much .
Perhaps it &apos;s Tom .
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
Do you know why he wasn &apos;t at school ?
I want your opinion .
I can &apos;t take Tom &apos;s money .
Tom and I enjoy swimming together .
He has a lot of books on history .
Tom speaks only French to his parents .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
Tom is only five , but he already knows how to read .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go .
Have you eaten dinner ?
Tom is still afraid of Mary .
Whatever you say .
I was trying to help .
Tom is coming to my house tonight .
Can you see Tom ?
You ought not to say such a thing .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
He has a bicycle .
He did it himself .
He looked quite tired .
We &apos;ll go see Tom .
We &apos;ll be leaving now .
There &apos;s so much more to learn .
That is his car .
Tom could read when he was three .
I &apos;m very tired and I want to go to bed early .
Did you see Tom today ?
Tom has more friends than Mary .
Nobody wants to do that .
Tell Tom I want to talk to him right away .
I hope Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
I really thought Tom was happy .
You &apos;ll have to go .
Can you drive a car ?
English is difficult to learn .
My brother speaks very fast .
Tom abandoned his wife and children .
We &apos;re reading .
I want very much for you to understand .
I went to bed very late .
I &apos;m here to see Tom .
My watch keeps good time .
I know what I want .
We &apos;re not doing that again .
I &apos;m not really that sorry .
He often doesn &apos;t come to school .
Why do you like Boston ?
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
Tom is almost as tall as you are .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Everything &apos;s going to be fine .
That &apos;s not the problem .
I saw him there .
I don &apos;t think Tom is finished .
We know you &apos;re there .
I &apos;m here to take Tom home .
I &apos;ll be good to you .
What do you want to say ?
Nothing &apos;s going on .
How do we do it ?
That &apos;s what I want , too .
We &apos;re not done yet .
Tom said something , but I couldn &apos;t hear what he said .
Kids grow up so fast .
How many times have I told you ?
It was the wrong thing to do .
We &apos;re here .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that .
Tom can &apos;t buy himself a car .
No one can help us .
He has more books than he can read .
They all say that .
She hardly ate anything .
You must be Tom .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary .
I have a thesis to write .
Tom needs Mary .
Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom &apos;s not busy .
Nobody wants you to do this .
How do you like your new school ?
I hope so .
You &apos;re not going to understand it .
I need Tom .
Tom is through .
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom know that ?
I thought I had enough money .
I &apos;d forgotten how much I liked Tom .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t hear you well .
What are you getting out of this ?
I don &apos;t want to go outside .
I think Tom did well .
Tom is going to be a father .
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to do that anymore .
It &apos;s not enough .
I don &apos;t want to play with Tom .
She was so tired that she couldn &apos;t walk .
All we want is for you to be happy .
I &apos;m a little tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk right now .
Well , what was I supposed to say ?
He wants to be a doctor in the future .
You sound like your mother .
We know you &apos;re still there .
He knows what &apos;s going on .
What am I going to say ?
Why are you asking me this ?
My English is anything but good .
Tom asked Mary for directions .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
Can anyone hear me ?
I &apos;m going , too .
I know that Tom has been sick .
Is he your teacher ?
What they did made Tom happy .
Tom heard Mary talking .
Do you want to go ?
Don &apos;t thank me now .
I forgot the book .
I think Tom will like that .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
Where is my son ?
I was having dinner with Tom .
You don &apos;t know that .
Have you found something ?
I just can &apos;t help .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t eat that .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
This came for you .
Are you planning to stay ?
The dog seems sick .
Is your dad here ?
Tom says he saw Mary .
Tom has been busy all morning .
I know how difficult this must be for you .
Tom and I gave Mary that .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
Your book is here .
You &apos;d better tell him the truth .
He does this all the time .
Tom seems quite happy .
He might come tomorrow .
It &apos;s a good school .
How many times have you been there ?
I can &apos;t give those to you .
I didn &apos;t like being kept waiting so long .
What did Tom just tell you ?
Are we sure about this ?
Tom wasn &apos;t done .
She got no answer from him .
She was there in the morning .
I can &apos;t help .
I don &apos;t believe everything Tom says .
It is a book .
Is Tom sure ?
You seem busy .
Why did you say such a thing ?
Who benefits from this ?
I &apos;m not certain , but I think so .
What we do is up to you .
I could learn something from you , I think .
The clock is fast .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
What do you want to say to Tom ?
Tom is now almost as tall as his father is .
You can &apos;t just go .
Tom wrote the letter himself .
That doesn &apos;t mean anything .
He &apos;s good at what he does .
Who is that boy ?
It &apos;s just not enough .
You must go at once .
Tom wanted to return to Boston .
This is not good at all .
Speaking English is a lot of fun .
They haven &apos;t come back home yet .
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend .
Has anyone found Tom yet ?
They &apos;re going to Boston .
I couldn &apos;t wait .
Tom was kept waiting for a long time .
Do you have children ?
How did you get into the house ?
Tom isn &apos;t welcome here .
Tom gave us everything he had .
That &apos;s the way Tom always does it .
Do you want Tom to do that ?
Both Tom and Mary study French .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
Tom had nothing .
You know Tom doesn &apos;t like that .
You can always rely on me .
Give me your money .
The train is very fast .
We almost never eat out .
She said she had been happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French well .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he has to do .
Please have someone else do that .
Tom wasn &apos;t told why Mary wasn &apos;t there .
How will you help Tom ?
We do want that , don &apos;t we ?
Tom should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
I just can &apos;t do it .
You &apos;re only deceiving yourself .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
I should go to bed .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait long .
That &apos;s what you have to do .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know the answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is like .
Something must be done !
We want to have a large family .
Give me a day .
What is it that you want ?
I &apos;m getting to it .
Are we done ?
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
I am still alone .
We know all about you .
What do you want to do with it ?
What &apos;s it we &apos;re waiting for ?
I &apos;ve found it .
I hope that Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s never been done before .
He is old enough to understand it .
I can only tell you what I know .
Tom has a house in Boston .
I &apos;ve got to see you .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know who I am .
I don &apos;t want to do that with Tom .
He &apos;s a good boy .
Tom seems busy .
You &apos;re welcome to write to me .
Did you do that ?
You aren &apos;t very happy , are you ?
I &apos;m not done with you yet .
Tom makes me better .
That was so much fun .
It &apos;s your turn .
There are still people who are illiterate .
I never heard you play it better .
I want to see you .
Tom wasn &apos;t very happy .
Tom took the job .
Did she say it ?
Tom arrived home safely .
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
I &apos;d like to go home early today .
I know what they &apos;re going to do .
I don &apos;t want anything to do with that .
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
How are Tom and Mary ?
It is easy to read this book .
You have everything .
Why does Tom want to go with us ?
Where can we meet you ?
Tom isn &apos;t like Mary .
We &apos;re not going to leave Mary alone with Tom , are we ?
I &apos;ll get back to you on this .
I told Tom that I wasn &apos;t busy .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t say that .
Everybody knows .
I didn &apos;t write anything .
I hope you &apos;re right .
What will become of her ?
Tom wanted to learn to swim .
I can never go home again .
Nobody came to help me .
He could not bring himself to believe her story .
Let &apos;s take the bus .
I thought I heard you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to be alone .
He wants a watch just like yours .
He is playing here .
That &apos;s not good enough .
I &apos;d like to become a doctor .
Tom will never understand why we want him to do this .
Please wait for me at the station .
What exactly happened there ?
Tom says Mary likes you .
Where will you be ?
He seems tired .
I &apos;m sure Tom told you .
You should not rely on others .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
What &apos;s up with you today ?
Mary isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s wife .
I should not have bought such a thing .
I do not like him either .
I really want to know .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
What were you doing about this time yesterday ?
We &apos;re kidding .
This really happened .
Did you like Boston ?
What have you been up to ?
Tom seems lucky .
We &apos;ve got to talk .
Tom &apos;s alive .
Is Tom alone now ?
Tom made us do the work .
Tom doesn &apos;t gamble .
I &apos;m not like Tom .
Tom &apos;s still a kid .
Tell Tom why .
Tom wanted to become a doctor .
I &apos;ll go .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
Please speak English .
I &apos;m in my car .
The problem is what we should do with this money .
We need to do this .
Tom says he has to study French .
It &apos;s much better now .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do that .
I know what you were doing .
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon .
You &apos;re sure taking your time .
Tom wants to leave .
Whenever Tom comes to Boston , he stays with us .
Here comes Tom .
It &apos;s not this one .
Is that it ?
We have lots and lots of time .
What does she have ?
They really did it .
Such things happen all the time .
Tell Tom he should do that .
I know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
I love him more than anything .
Is Boston a big city ?
She asked him to stay , but he had to go to work .
Tom became sleepy .
I can &apos;t trust what she says .
He gave me food and money as well .
Who was it that did that yesterday ?
I &apos;d like to know what you think .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
Tom enjoyed it .
Why didn &apos;t anyone come ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
Can we not talk about this just now ?
Tom came alone .
They saw me .
I saw you there .
What is two times two ?
Tom is my teacher .
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
Why is she here ?
I have a dog .
Tom may have to do that .
That &apos;s not how it is .
You should have one of us do it .
You didn &apos;t let me answer .
Why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
Did you meet him ?
I won &apos;t assist you .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom has a lot of time .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
Do you want to play with Tom ?
Why is the dog here ?
I &apos;m so sorry for what I did .
I want to take Tom home .
What are we to do ?
I want a refund .
I wish Tom would come to Boston .
She told me she knew my brother .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
I did what I could .
What do we know about Tom ?
I have nothing further to say .
Where are you ?
Mary is my wife .
The truth is very simple .
I &apos;m positive .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
Mary is like a sister to me .
No one knows you &apos;re here .
What was Tom like ?
I have another question .
She knew what needed to be done .
We &apos;ll get this one .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to have anything to do with me .
Tom &apos;s family is in Boston .
I think Tom is afraid of you .
I didn &apos;t know Mary was Tom &apos;s sister .
You &apos;ve already done that .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
I only wish I &apos;d been able to do more for Tom .
Tom won &apos;t go alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a family .
You &apos;re going to want to see this .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Tom &apos;s not here .
I saw the children walk across the street .
They approve .
They say he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
Tom asked Mary to help .
Tom is saying something .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing this ?
You should have one of us do it .
Tom pretended like it never happened .
I have a question .
Tom knows I &apos;m home .
No one knew a thing .
I think you have a problem , Tom .
I want to know who you are .
Does it get any better than this ?
You have time .
You can believe me .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
Do you know who those people are ?
That &apos;s what we do here .
I &apos;m sorry about this .
I &apos;m scared of Tom &apos;s dog .
Tom wants to be with Mary .
Tom made a lot of mistakes .
I said nothing .
You &apos;d better go . It &apos;s getting late .
There &apos;s no coffee .
Is he correct ?
Don &apos;t ask me that again .
Mary and I plan to have two children .
Mary asked me to pretend to be her boyfriend .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll like that .
I don &apos;t need your help .
I enjoy your company .
Is Tom still at school ?
I lost the watch .
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know .
I can hardly hear you .
Is Tom here ?
No one here can swim .
I &apos;ll only be staying a few days .
What &apos;s it doing out here ?
Can you drive me home ?
It was yesterday that I met her .
I think Tom knows already .
I didn &apos;t say it was going to be easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time .
That is her house .
My son is not old enough for school .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have kept Mary waiting so long .
Tom just got home from work .
If I had enough money , I could buy this book .
I know how that goes .
The girl talking with Tom is Mary .
Tom is busy writing a letter .
I &apos;d like to see them both .
Did Tom find you ?
He is nothing but a child .
I should not have said that .
Is Tom good at driving ?
She lost a book .
I can &apos;t help you .
I should &apos;ve taken the money .
Tom likes Boston .
Isn &apos;t life beautiful ?
Tom saw it .
I know what I think .
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
I &apos;ve finished reading that book .
I don &apos;t want to work .
Give me what I want .
I enjoy being a teacher .
Thank you for coming to see me .
I think Tom isn &apos;t home .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it right now .
I am very sorry for what I said .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
You &apos;re always busy .
Tom could help you .
Tom knows no French .
Tom and Mary each have a bicycle .
I do hope so .
Who gave you that ?
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said to Mary ?
I should just tell Tom the truth .
I don &apos;t have time for this .
I &apos;m able to swim .
I would like to hear your opinion .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
You should tell him the truth .
You can &apos;t do everything .
Tom left the house .
I can &apos;t see everything .
What did she say ?
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t like speaking French .
I believe we &apos;ve seen enough .
I like you just the way you are .
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
I just have a couple of questions .
This is the watch I bought yesterday .
I don &apos;t know why I just did that .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
He found my bicycle .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
We don &apos;t want Tom to do that anymore .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
You know this is what I want .
I will help you when I have finished my work .
That won &apos;t happen .
He can read and write .
I &apos;ve heard nothing .
Where &apos;s Tom gone ?
I wish I could speak English .
How long do you have ?
Tell Tom to get here early .
Tom looked very happy .
I can &apos;t read this .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
Mary has big eyes .
That &apos;ll be good .
Who has it ?
That &apos;ll be fun .
Tom has been found .
I don &apos;t feel well today .
What do you want to give Tom ?
You really should talk to Tom .
What are people saying ?
That happened here .
I &apos;m in Boston now .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
He will not be back tomorrow .
Tom is feeling a little better today .
Tom goes to school , doesn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll wait .
Tom would never do that .
I told you Tom was busy .
I want to say I &apos;m sorry .
I was on a bike .
Tom is going to be happy here .
Are we alone ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
She seems happy .
Tom goes to school .
Tom will probably be right .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
You must stay the night .
He has too many books .
When will he be back ?
I need a little time .
I think Tom and Mary are going to be so happy together .
Did Tom just leave ?
He may have been ill .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
I can &apos;t live without you .
What &apos;s going on here ?
Tom is at home almost every evening .
Tom told me that he &apos;d like to become a doctor .
Tom speaks French as well as English .
You don &apos;t understand me .
Tom can speak French .
No one is going with me .
Why are you doing that ?
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
We &apos;re all scared .
Do you have my money ?
Tom has already done a lot for us .
You &apos;ve got to help me learn to drive .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
At what time will you be leaving ?
How did you like it ?
We can &apos;t do that .
I want to understand Tom .
Didn &apos;t Tom go to Mary &apos;s house ?
Give me your money !
I am afraid of what the teacher will say .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like me .
What could you have done ?
We have one for you , too .
Tom isn &apos;t busy today .
What have you done ?
What should I do now ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything about himself .
Tom dated Mary for three years .
I can &apos;t make out what she said .
We both know you don &apos;t live where you say you do .
Tom says he &apos;s never had a girlfriend .
What is this ?
We &apos;ll speak to Tom later .
Tom said that he &apos;d be right back .
Don &apos;t leave them alone .
Tom had a cat .
I have money enough to buy it .
I like my life .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
I &apos;ve got too much to do .
I do not love him anymore .
It &apos;s not your fault .
He asked after you .
I said that I would help him .
This isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
I &apos;ve never felt so happy in my life .
He wrote a letter yesterday .
I hope that won &apos;t happen again .
We &apos;re with you .
I am tired of hearing that .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
Tom looks like he &apos;s a bit tired .
I forgot to give you what Tom gave me to give you .
I thought I was too old .
Tom can &apos;t have done it .
That isn &apos;t what I said .
Tom is three years old .
I asked Tom to speak French .
My father is in his room .
I need a little help .
My mother was up late last night .
Where are your children ?
I don &apos;t think your mother will like it .
What does this look like ?
We can &apos;t be sure , can we ?
It was very hard .
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying .
Tom &apos;s response was immediate .
The girl has no mother .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
You might try asking Tom .
We all agree with you .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows exactly how that happened .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
No one knew why .
Do you really want to be here ?
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
They want to learn English .
We found it .
Tom didn &apos;t think so .
Tom can &apos;t help the way he is .
How was your day ?
Tom , where are you ?
We were all tired .
Nobody did anything .
That is my school .
There are almost no books .
Tom may come .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait that long .
He looks like his mother .
My hearing isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
Tom &apos;s fast .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Do you want to work here ?
You talk fast .
I don &apos;t believe it at all .
Tom will come tomorrow .
It &apos;s all I want .
Tom is going to Boston .
I found them .
When did you and Tom do that ?
Thank you for being there .
She is getting better day by day .
I don &apos;t know where that is .
I &apos;m sorry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .
Tom asked me to do that for him .
I can &apos;t believe that actually happened .
Both of my parents are still living .
When does Tom want to do that ?
I wish I could swim .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have much money .
You know that better than I do .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
I &apos;ve known that for a long time .
We &apos;ve got each other .
Where did everyone else go ?
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t remember .
Do you know whether she can speak English ?
I &apos;m not good at this sort of thing .
You &apos;re like Tom .
He didn &apos;t want to talk about it further .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
Are you with me ?
Things would never be the same .
I saw Tom before he saw me .
That we are not able to do .
I &apos;m probably wrong .
That &apos;s not what I mean .
All we want to do is eat .
I just wanted you to know that .
Everybody &apos;s still there .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to his wife .
Let &apos;s ask him .
Do you know how to do that ?
Tom said he knew Mary .
Tom knows he shouldn &apos;t do that .
There is nothing to do .
I wish I had a car .
That keeps happening to me .
I should have come earlier .
What do you want to say ?
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
Tom is coming to Boston with us .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where it is .
I think you &apos;re both right .
We have to leave now .
Tom isn &apos;t going to leave us .
Here &apos;s the bus .
I &apos;m going to write Tom a letter .
I know Tom well .
Life is beautiful .
I want to know what it is .
He asked me if I was busy .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
I gave one to Tom , too .
We only have three days left .
Tom told Mary he had a lot of money .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Tom lives in Boston with his mother .
We are with you .
There isn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Nobody wants you to do this .
He asked about the others .
Tom , I &apos;m home .
I &apos;ve done it before .
Aren &apos;t you tired ?
Why is Tom doing this ?
I can &apos;t give Tom everything he wants .
I don &apos;t love you .
Tom frequently speaks with Mary .
Did you see your friends last week ?
Did you guys hear that ?
We &apos;re going alone .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
It would be better for you to read more books .
That was Tom .
I &apos;ve got a question .
I don &apos;t know who can do that and who can &apos;t .
Doing that wasn &apos;t an option .
Isn &apos;t this what you want ?
It &apos;s up to us to do it .
Let &apos;s go out and eat dinner together from time to time .
Why are people afraid of Tom ?
Tom and Mary were both busy .
Tom wants what Mary has .
We &apos;re afraid .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
Where does he work ?
You need me more than I need you .
I &apos;ve been to Boston a couple of times .
Thank you for coming .
I know you better than your wife does .
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
I still have things left to do .
We want to live here .
I can &apos;t go to school today . I &apos;m sick .
We need to eat .
We have one for you , too .
Is someone there ?
Is Tom in Boston ?
A man must work .
I think he won &apos;t come .
What &apos;re you up to today ?
Tom is too busy to go today .
I will give her the book tomorrow .
I can &apos;t just do nothing .
That wouldn &apos;t be good .
I &apos;m too tired .
How many windows are there ?
She won &apos;t be pleased .
Tom says he &apos;s on his way back home .
I have one of those , too .
I feel happy .
He arrived rather late .
Where &apos;s the car ?
We &apos;ll do it when we have time .
Do you want to leave ?
You shouldn &apos;t talk here .
What have you been doing all this while ?
I think my parents know .
She came to my aid .
I want to help .
We won &apos;t let it happen again .
The problem is that my son doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
Tom and I are good friends .
I wish I had a brother .
What should I say ?
Tom does have to do that .
I don &apos;t know Tom as well as I know you .
I hope it &apos;s not Tom .
I don &apos;t trust you .
You must get ready quickly .
You &apos;ve done it again .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom is no longer my boyfriend .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
I &apos;ll get the book .
What was Tom wearing ?
It looks like Tom isn &apos;t at home .
Tom isn &apos;t heavy .
What does Tom want ?
They have lived here for ten years .
Tom likes what he does .
You ought to listen to your mother .
I &apos;m busy .
I want to see Boston .
Tom knows what he wants .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
They aren &apos;t coming today .
We &apos;ll be here .
You &apos;d better not tell Tom .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s girl .
I &apos;d love to do it .
I want to know who you are .
I want to stay here with you .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
Tom looks fine .
I should &apos;ve listened to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Did you go to see a doctor ?
You &apos;re afraid of him .
I would rather stay here .
I &apos;ll get this to Tom .
Can we believe that ?
Did Tom tell you that ?
That &apos;s good , too .
Tom thought nobody was at home .
Tom is still there .
No one knows anything .
How long have we been here ?
Tom told me that he was happy .
I &apos;ll give this to Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
I have a family .
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak much French .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Tom may leave .
Tom rarely ever spoke .
Tom is going to make mistakes .
I love you more than anything .
Tom was at school .
I will stay .
We can &apos;t live like this .
I &apos;m safe .
I &apos;m going there now .
You are better than me .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
All my friends will be there .
Tom said he could give Mary some money .
She goes to school .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Where do you want to go ?
I want my mom .
Everyone &apos;s doing it .
What are they doing there ?
How &apos;s Tom going to do it ?
Tom said that he loved me , too .
What do you say ?
How long did Tom say he &apos;d be in Boston ?
We &apos;re not coming .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who Mary is .
I know what his name is .
I &apos;m old .
What are you going to do ?
I know where she is .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Is that what Tom said ?
This is what I need .
I have to say this .
I &apos;m going back .
I can wait for you .
I never said anything like that .
We really have to go .
Like father , like son .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
She is a bit like her mother .
Here &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
Tell me what to do .
We &apos;re not going to talk to Tom .
He can &apos;t do it .
We have work to do .
Can we help you ?
What do you know about Tom &apos;s family ?
Tom was right at home .
Why do I have to study French ?
We &apos;re not happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary does .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
Live and let live .
He had fun with her .
Do you have somewhere to stay ?
I want your money .
What are you up to today ?
What are we going to do with that ?
I &apos;m happy tonight .
We &apos;ve found it .
Did something happen ?
I told Tom .
You are the one .
The cat doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
The food is ready .
I want you to go to the doctor .
Do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
Tom is doing well .
Tom said Mary was happy .
I suppose they are coming .
You are big .
Is the job too much for you ?
I can &apos;t read yet .
I don &apos;t think Tom did it .
Tom and Mary are both my friends .
I &apos;m afraid of Tom .
That &apos;s not the way it happened at all .
How many times have I told you ?
She asked about the others .
Are you still Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Tom is going to be there .
What do you guys have ?
I &apos;m with my family right now .
I don &apos;t think I know Tom .
Tom says he has plenty of time .
I &apos;m out of here .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
Did Tom find you ?
I want to give Tom this .
Is now a good time to talk to Tom ?
I forgot what I was about to say .
Tom will never believe me again .
Tom left earlier .
Tom is playing outside .
This is a fun activity for children .
I don &apos;t think I can get through all this work by five .
They are big .
Tom speaks French well , but not as well as he speaks English .
Give that to me .
Someone might see us .
Tom is as tall as Mary .
Let me drive you home .
Who did it ?
I really don &apos;t need any help .
I &apos;ve had enough of Tom and Mary .
Do you know this ?
What do you know about this ?
Is her father a teacher ?
Tom and Mary are good people .
Do you have a bicycle ?
We know how Tom is .
Are you happy where you are ?
Please don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
You were late for work .
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
Do you know what Tom wants ?
He has a large family .
I saw what I saw .
Are you here to see Tom ?
They are all very busy .
Tom is a good friend of Mary &apos;s .
Maybe Tom can help you .
He can be trusted .
What &apos;s wrong , Tom ?
Tom looked away .
I &apos;m not so sure anymore .
Did Tom really do that ?
I &apos;m very tired .
I don &apos;t know because I wasn &apos;t there .
I know what I need to do .
I wish I had done more .
Tom and Mary will know what to do .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
This isn &apos;t about Tom .
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
You &apos;ve been at it for hours .
If I can do it , so can you .
His name eludes me .
It was very simple .
What should I say to Tom ?
I don &apos;t swim as well as you do .
Tom knew he needed to leave town .
Can I stay a little longer ?
I know where the money is .
We don &apos;t know why .
I &apos;m sure about this .
You are in my way .
I told you so .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary would be there .
Tom didn &apos;t say a word to me .
Kids like to play .
She lives with him .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
I don &apos;t want to do this with you .
He wants to come with us .
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
What &apos;s there to say ?
Tom likes to eat out .
We &apos;ll help you .
Are you in Boston right now ?
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
Maybe we can talk about that later .
You know some French , don &apos;t you ?
Let &apos;s not speak French today .
Tom likes you very much .
Where shall I wait for you ?
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
Were you telling the truth ?
I am well acquainted with him .
I will be at home tomorrow .
I bought this book yesterday .
This room has three windows .
You make me happy .
Did you eat something last night ?
Tell Tom .
I &apos;m not doing that .
He will be talking with his family at this time tomorrow .
I said too much .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
You know what Tom &apos;s answer is going to be .
I told Tom that his French was easy to understand .
Tom wondered how much Mary weighed .
I &apos;ve been seen .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
It &apos;s too long .
Are you almost ready ?
Is that all you have ?
I expect Tom will know what to do .
I don &apos;t like that anymore .
I &apos;ve never heard of him .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
Tell us what to do .
Tom had to go himself .
He wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
They &apos;ll want Tom .
I am well .
I have a brother .
They &apos;re not coming .
I love my life .
Where is your room ?
That can wait until later .
Tom asked Mary where she &apos;d been .
Tom saw the bus .
I thought that Tom was in Boston .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
Tom knew how to do that .
I have to go now .
Why do you always do that to me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look too good .
Where are you heading ?
I &apos;m too busy to help him .
I will help you all I can .
I think it &apos;s too early to tell .
Tom has a family now .
Where &apos;s the cat ?
They won &apos;t find you .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told me that .
You hardly ate anything .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary .
You speak French very well .
I &apos;m in the car .
She handed him a book .
That &apos;s not nice .
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday .
We don &apos;t have to read that .
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
I think we need to go back to Boston .
You know I love you .
What do they do here ?
Don &apos;t ask for money .
They will be safe with me .
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t need them .
Did you do this on your own ?
I want to go .
She is going to learn how to drive .
Tom did that well .
You have to help me .
That &apos;s my brother .
She is his friend .
He does not know .
He will not listen to me .
The train is arriving soon .
Are you still there ?
I will give him the book tomorrow .
How many people are here today ?
I don &apos;t want her .
Tom and Mary were lucky kids .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have enough money to buy that .
I don &apos;t know if I can do that or not .
My clock is five minutes fast .
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
I &apos;ve done that once already .
You may stay here as long as you like .
Are you free now ?
I &apos;ll never be like Tom .
Can you give me some money ?
I think they look good .
Tom was correct about one thing .
I should have told her that I love her .
I couldn &apos;t believe what I was seeing .
Tom knows what he likes .
Tom and Mary were very happy together .
Give me a little more water .
Tom is happy , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom is standing in front of Mary .
Tom did that very well .
How good are they ?
I cared about Tom .
What &apos;re you saying ?
You can still help Tom , can &apos;t you ?
I already have a girlfriend .
Tom left without me .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
Can we talk to Tom ?
Did Tom give it to you ?
You have to go .
I believe it &apos;s finished .
Who has it now ?
I should &apos;ve become a teacher .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
Tom is coming back .
I told Tom to help Mary .
You can wait for me here .
Have you ever seen Tom &apos;s mother ?
Tom just doesn &apos;t want to hear this .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
I &apos;d like to know what it is .
Tom and I want to see you .
The door is still open .
There are still a lot of things to do .
Where is my car ?
Who are you all ?
Tom really should speak French .
Tom is done .
I want much more .
It could be Tom .
Tell me again what Tom and I are supposed to do .
My father has a lot of books .
I don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing this .
I ran out of money .
I didn &apos;t know that she had a child .
I &apos;ll help you .
Tom and Mary just don &apos;t hit it off .
We have to find Tom .
Tom asked Mary to help me .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t my friend .
You are my mother .
Tom likes it in Boston .
He kept me waiting .
Tom isn &apos;t with me .
I think we have enough .
What have we done ?
I don &apos;t know who wrote this letter .
Mary likes Japan , doesn &apos;t she ?
I feel sorry for the children .
What are your plans for tonight ?
He wished she had more time for him .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I would like to meet you .
When are you busy ?
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
Tom wanted to go to Australia .
I go to school .
That &apos;s how you do it .
He said he would write to me , but he hasn &apos;t .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom didn &apos;t quit .
They &apos;re outside .
I don &apos;t want to go there again .
I don &apos;t need a lot of money .
I don &apos;t have a house anymore .
Tom is good at what he does .
Tom is like a father to me .
Tom is good at what he does .
This doesn &apos;t involve you .
Did you really say that ?
My mother is seriously ill .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
That &apos;s common knowledge .
Tom never makes his bed .
It would have been nice if Tom had listened to what I said more carefully .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
You may take either of the books .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Let me hear it .
What else do you want me to do ?
Where is the book ?
That &apos;s up to you .
Nobody wants you to do that .
You should go to bed early .
Tom has more books than I do .
All we need is water .
Tom would never do such a thing .
We &apos;re sorry .
Where is the problem ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
No one listened to me .
I think we can be friends .
Tom said he &apos;d be right back .
What kind of question is that , Tom ?
The girl did not say anything .
Everyone &apos;s going .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
Tom is a very good boy .
What do you want , Tom ?
Tom said that yesterday .
You can stay here as long as you want .
Tom might hear you .
What &apos;s Tom doing here ?
Tom might go .
Who gave you that ?
That &apos;s my boy .
Tom is afraid of you .
You &apos;ll like this .
I love going to school here .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
You &apos;ll be happy .
Tom had nothing to do with that .
Thank you for coming early .
Father came home .
I &apos;m going home with Tom .
Why did Tom want to learn French ?
I heard something .
I have to do it again .
Let &apos;s go now .
We don &apos;t need to do that now .
He has nothing to do .
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
I want to have a job that I love .
Tom has left town .
Where is the train ?
We &apos;re not finished .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
If he has time , he will come .
I hope Tom is right .
We were at school together .
Tell me what it was like .
I &apos;d like to read it .
Are you happy here ?
No one will believe him .
They have been busy .
I saw him enter the room .
Tom can &apos;t talk .
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
What is all this ?
They &apos;re doing OK .
I have to study .
Tom &apos;s parents were both teachers .
Why does Tom have to go ?
I already told you that she isn &apos;t here .
That isn &apos;t to my liking .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t have enough money on me at this time .
This book is hers .
I didn &apos;t like that any more than you did .
There is a book on the table .
Is that what Tom said ?
I saw this coming .
I don &apos;t need it .
He &apos;s good .
What does Tom do ?
Tom is on his way home .
I need this more than you do .
Mary is my mother .
Tom has gone for good .
We &apos;d better find it .
This is simply not true .
We don &apos;t speak French .
They say she &apos;s sick .
I would do it if I had more time on my hands .
I can &apos;t go home .
That girl looks like a boy .
I &apos;ve lost .
No one was there .
I thought that you might &apos;ve left town .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
He didn &apos;t want to do it .
I &apos;d better see him .
Is he back already ?
I wish I had been there with you .
I bought it .
I would like to hear your opinion .
Tom said he was from Australia .
I &apos;d love to have one of those .
That doesn &apos;t answer my question .
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
I let go of Tom &apos;s hand .
I want to talk to you about Tom .
We &apos;re here , too .
He &apos;s my father .
Tom is sick in bed .
Tom left immediately .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with us .
That girl looks like a boy .
I bought the car .
I believe Tom .
Tom looks like his brother .
She said that she was happy .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he heard .
Tom and Mary are friends .
Tom knows he should do it , but he doesn &apos;t want to .
I hope to see you tomorrow .
Tom won &apos;t go away if you don &apos;t want him to .
I don &apos;t think that Tom can hear Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I believe .
Don &apos;t give up like that .
I &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
I don &apos;t need your help .
Why should you want to do that ?
They &apos;re brother and sister .
Tom is going to do that for Mary .
We want to know why .
Where does Tom live ?
No one can help you .
Do you have a problem with me ?
What do you want me to say ?
It &apos;s about time to go to school .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
Tom &apos;s right .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
Tom hasn &apos;t written the letter yet .
You should never ask a woman how old she is .
Why can &apos;t Tom just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
I believe Tom is correct .
We don &apos;t have to do that .
The only time Tom seems to be happy is when he &apos;s with Mary .
I think Tom is still in Boston .
Tom , are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
I have some money .
Please wait for five minutes .
Tom seems happy .
Why do they do this ?
I know Boston .
You must do as you are told .
Are these yours , Tom ?
I didn &apos;t need to tell him .
I couldn &apos;t resist doing that .
She went there to swim .
They are very big .
I know them all .
What happened out here ?
You need to go .
I &apos;d never seen anything like that before .
Why is Tom going ?
Why can &apos;t I see you ?
I can &apos;t do that .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
You have to study more .
What &apos;re they up to ?
He asked me whether I was busy .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at French .
Tom and Mary are still just kids .
Tom likes Mary , you know ?
You never actually did that , did you ?
Why are you avoiding me ?
He likes to talk about himself .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t need my help ?
See you tomorrow .
When did I do that ?
I wish Tom was here .
Where are the other guys ?
Can I help you ?
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
I think we need more water .
If I had enough money , I would buy the book .
I thought he would come .
I &apos;d like to stay for one night .
I don &apos;t like both of them .
We &apos;re friends .
We just got back from Boston .
Tom made his parents happy .
I thought I could count on you .
I &apos;ll be right with you .
They &apos;re not good .
I &apos;m not able to swim .
I will never see him .
How old is that dog ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
He does not live there any more .
I &apos;ve often heard about you .
Tom said it was out of the question .
Tom forgot to write to Mary .
We know Tom is here .
Tom never seems to know what to say .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three years .
I &apos;d really like to help .
You should listen to him .
That &apos;s exactly what we need .
Who has it ?
I didn &apos;t buy the book .
That &apos;s not a proper thing to say .
I won &apos;t need you .
Boston is where I want to go .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ll read this book .
That doesn &apos;t happen .
How come you ask ?
What do we want here ?
Tom knows what Mary wants .
Tom will remain .
What are they doing ?
It is certain that he will come .
I don &apos;t believe it .
Do you want me to go away ?
I don &apos;t know those people .
No one had an answer .
Why are people scared of you ?
Tom found one .
I &apos;ve got no time for that now .
I think I &apos;ll do that .
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
Tom wants to know why .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t have to .
He did not come .
You aren &apos;t any better than me .
Tom didn &apos;t hear Mary enter the room .
She gave him some food .
He wasn &apos;t even there .
No one &apos;s here .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom seems to agree with us .
All men are equal .
Tom watched Mary work .
You aren &apos;t Tom .
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
I appreciate your telling me .
Tom is working on it right now .
Tom doesn &apos;t want one .
Do you know where you are ?
I can only speak for myself .
What exactly has Tom done ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
Is she at home ?
Is this your bicycle ?
I had fun with it .
Tom needs to do that every morning .
She gave him some money .
I don &apos;t even know where she is right now .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
Tom can do it better than me .
Do you have a family ?
How are you now ?
Where were you guys today ?
Tom can do better than that , I think .
She was too tired to speak .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
I must buy one .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
We &apos;ll take my car .
Do you want to do it with me ?
He may be on the next train .
She tried to swim .
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher .
Why are you so happy ?
We get on OK .
Don &apos;t you want to come with us ?
Thanks for the help .
Don &apos;t you want Tom there ?
That has nothing to do with you .
Tom looked busy .
We need to speak with you .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tell Tom what to do .
Why do you have two cars ?
She needs it .
Tom made only three mistakes .
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well .
They want to see you .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
I do feel pretty good .
What happened to you last night ?
I have never seen such a thing .
Tell me something that I don &apos;t know .
I want to meet with Tom .
I want to meet people and have fun .
You &apos;ve done it again .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
We know this .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
I have more books than I can read .
How did this happen ?
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
No one said anything .
You should buy it for yourself .
They look good .
We saw Tom .
We &apos;re going to do it again .
We require your help .
I &apos;d like to go cycling .
Give that to Tom .
What do you want to learn ?
It would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had been here .
I am your friend , right ?
He went to bed .
How did you find us ?
Tom is from Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom asked for more money .
I &apos;m not feeling well today .
Do you have many friends ?
It serves you right .
I can &apos;t leave Tom behind .
It &apos;s not us who did it .
You told me that before .
I don &apos;t want it .
He said that he was very happy .
It should be fun doing that .
We &apos;re not home right now .
We &apos;re learning French .
I bought her a clock .
I don &apos;t have to be here . I &apos;m here because I want to be .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
I go swimming once a week .
Tom wanted to leave , but Mary wanted to stay a little longer .
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
How did you come to school ?
I &apos;ve been here for three years .
You should leave .
What is it , Tom ?
I want to be sure .
Tom saw Mary with another man .
Tom asked me to ask you something .
Get a doctor in here .
We don &apos;t need him .
This is the big one .
Is this a good time to buy a house ?
It &apos;s hard to please Tom .
Let me see what &apos;s in your hand .
Tom may know why Mary has to do that .
You should leave at once .
Who &apos;s sick ?
I like this one .
I have simply nothing to say about it .
Where are we eating tonight ?
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
Tom speaks too fast .
What did that suggest to you ?
Let me speak to Tom first .
I &apos;m from Boston .
Your question has no answer .
I know about you and Tom .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
I heard what you said to Tom at school .
He can &apos;t drive .
Tom wanted Mary to be his wife .
I met your friend .
I &apos;ll see you in there .
When was the last time I told you I loved you ?
The time will come when you will know the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too happy .
I would like to tell you something .
My mother is not always at home .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
No one is saying that .
I am good at history .
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
Who are you and what are you doing here ?
I got it for next to nothing .
We still have time .
I haven &apos;t even told Tom .
Tom is with Mary .
I didn &apos;t like it .
Tom watched Mary eat .
I want to read it .
I could swim well even when I was a boy .
Tom needs time .
Why does Tom always look so tired ?
Tom does everything well .
This has happened before .
Did you hear it too ?
I know Tom .
I want to drive .
I &apos;d like you to help me do that .
Let me see .
This is my friend , Tom .
Is that your son ?
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
Why do you have to be like that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well .
Tom wanted to work .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Tom was like a father to me .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know whether I should believe Tom or not .
What more is there ?
You really need a woman .
I want to live here .
I told you I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Do we have time ?
You don &apos;t have to be here .
I want some of those .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
I think I know what to say .
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
What are we doing here ?
I can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re really here .
You could &apos;ve said something .
You are not a child anymore .
I &apos;ve found something .
I &apos;d like to be alone now .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
I had fun with it .
How many were there ?
Tom told Mary it wouldn &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;d prefer not to speak French .
Tom wants us to leave .
You don &apos;t know what I know .
I have to work .
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
How are we going to do it ?
Tom went cycling with one of his friends .
We hardly see you anymore .
