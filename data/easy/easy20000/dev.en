How long have you been dating ?
I think we can do it .
You are entirely correct .
We were sick .
Who are your parents ?
I looked at Tom .
I need friends .
I am like my father .
I &apos;m not going to ask you again .
Tom knows what to say .
Nothing &apos;s going on .
Tom doesn &apos;t know he shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
I want my money .
Tom has come to see you .
Tom is fast , but Mary isn &apos;t .
That has something to do with this problem .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
He must be very happy .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Tom wants you to eat .
I want to know what &apos;s going on here .
When did that happen ?
I have to learn French .
These are yours .
I have not been sick for the past ten years .
Did she say that ?
You may take either of the books .
I know how to do it .
Tom went for a doctor .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
What have you been doing ?
We can speak French .
Why have you abandoned me ?
I received your letter yesterday .
What &apos;s your father do ?
That wasn &apos;t Tom .
He came home very late .
My father gave me a watch , but I lost it .
Tom &apos;s family is in Australia .
They weren &apos;t there .
I want to eat something .
She doesn &apos;t live with him .
The dog seems to be sick .
Do you have money ?
I also have a sister .
I know you &apos;re not like that .
Why do you always do that to me ?
Can I come ?
Where &apos;s your school ?
We don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
That can &apos;t be helped .
What are you planning to do ?
Can you believe that ?
He seems to have been sick last week .
I have eyes .
Tom could barely walk .
What am I supposed to say ?
He is her friend .
What have you been doing all this time !
Please let me in .
I wish I could understand French .
You should wait for Tom .
Did you notice any errors ?
Tom is like his father .
I am coming .
Tom didn &apos;t go alone .
Tom isn &apos;t as tired as Mary .
How long has Tom been living in Boston ?
I have a lot of friends here .
My opinion really doesn &apos;t matter .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
I made a mistake .
How did you hit on that ?
Tom is as big as I am .
I think Tom likes his job .
Tom will be at home tomorrow .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
What do you have to do ?
I have something to say to you .
I said good night to my parents and went to bed .
I still need your help .
What &apos;s there to eat ?
I go to school with him .
How long do I have to wait ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
Tom will do that , I &apos;m pretty sure .
She is not here yet .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
Tom walked home .
He wrote one letter .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
I guess Tom forgot to tell you .
Tom gave it back to Mary .
He is soon to be a father .
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake .
All of us are happy .
Tom would never do such a thing .
Have you watched it ?
We &apos;re not doing that .
Tom said nothing .
How are you going to do it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be with us .
I made that one .
Tom wasn &apos;t here .
Tom lost weight very quickly .
Can anyone help me ?
What did Tom do ?
I like to go to school .
Tom looked very tired when I saw him yesterday .
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
We don &apos;t have a problem .
I don &apos;t want to know .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
I was planning to do that , but I never got the chance .
I love my mother .
We know you &apos;re still there .
That &apos;s too much .
He is no longer a child .
Have you told your mother ?
Don &apos;t you have something to say to Tom ?
Why are people afraid of the police ?
What are your names ?
Get Tom to help you .
We &apos;ve found Tom .
Tom says he feels a little better .
You &apos;re talking too fast .
They know who you are .
That did me good .
I &apos;ll be home alone all night .
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
I don &apos;t think he is right .
He can &apos;t read it .
I know Tom would love to see you .
Did you guys hear that ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do that .
This is my bike .
He wants to learn to swim .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
We did that yesterday .
We can depend on Tom .
They should know it .
She spends a lot of money on books .
School is out .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home now .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s father .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
That &apos;s one way of putting it .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here today .
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom ?
I received a letter from her .
Tom isn &apos;t going to come home .
What do you want to ask me ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has met Mary yet .
I want us to be friends again .
Tom is going out again .
Where are your parents ?
I don &apos;t want it anymore .
Tom might be sick .
He was kept waiting for a long time .
Tom likes that .
What more do you want , Tom ?
You can &apos;t go home now .
They aren &apos;t here .
I have seen enough .
We must find it .
I &apos;ve located Tom .
They don &apos;t want you here .
Tom didn &apos;t try to go any further .
They saw us yesterday .
I can &apos;t swim any further .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
I think it &apos;s very good .
We &apos;re getting there .
Let Tom live .
Who is in this room ?
I wondered why Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
You don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s home is , do you ?
You did what had to be done .
He has left his family .
This is where Tom wants to live .
How long &apos;ll that take ?
Tom knows why Mary is here .
We walked here .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
It wasn &apos;t mine .
Here &apos;s what we want .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
You shouldn &apos;t have bought that .
No one saw Tom do that .
Tom has written to me .
He &apos;s a teacher and so am I .
I don &apos;t want to come back here ever again .
I &apos;ve never done it before .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t much help .
Tom admitted his mistakes .
You &apos;ve never been as busy as I am right now .
Are you from Boston , too ?
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s doing OK .
Have you ever met Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Here we are !
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
Everybody &apos;s talking about it .
None of your business .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Where can I meet Tom ?
Tom can drive a car .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
Father is still in bed .
You &apos;ve found it .
I had nothing to say to Tom .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom did it , didn &apos;t he ?
Tom left without me .
Do you know where Tom lives ?
That &apos;s true as well .
I need to know that Tom is still alive .
Did you like Boston ?
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
Tom got that from Mary .
We don &apos;t talk much .
You know that I &apos;m right .
He &apos;s not in our group .
Tom , Mary and John were all there .
Here comes Tom .
We &apos;re here to have fun .
I &apos;m not sure how Tom will do it .
Tom is as tall as I am .
English is not hard to learn .
There is something I must know .
You can &apos;t go home now .
Are you really that busy ?
I want it .
My father is a good speaker of English .
Why did you become a police officer ?
It appears to me that you are right .
What &apos;s written in the book ?
How long have you been here in Boston ?
Don &apos;t be a stranger .
It is said that he is sick .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
If I don &apos;t go , who will ?
You can &apos;t see Tom today .
Tom would never have done that that way .
Tom will be here in a while .
I just want to let you know that I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
Here is a letter for you .
Tom is too good for you .
Tom speaks French better than me .
Tom knows I like him .
He can scarcely write his name .
I wish I could be in Boston now .
Tom won &apos;t come , and Mary won &apos;t either .
He looks like his father .
This makes me very happy .
