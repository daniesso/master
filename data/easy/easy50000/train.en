Tom didn &apos;t think the rain would last so long .
Why are you saying that to me ?
It &apos;s all quite simple .
I know him only by name .
I have a lot of friends here .
I left my wife .
I wish that wasn &apos;t the case .
He has fallen in love with me .
Tom came over .
I took your word for it .
She isn &apos;t young .
Why not let Tom try ?
Let &apos;s begin .
You have to do it today .
That &apos;s not where I want to go .
My father drives to work .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
Do you want me to help you ?
Listen to your father .
We both know it &apos;s too late .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary &apos;s living there alone .
You stole the money , didn &apos;t you ?
If I were you , I &apos;d talk to Tom .
The work was all but finished .
I don &apos;t know where you live .
They &apos;re about to leave .
Do you want me to be happy ?
Your French is really quite good .
I need somebody to talk to .
You &apos;re afraid of him .
&quot; I saw her five days ago , &quot; he said .
I get the feeling that I &apos;ve heard that somewhere before .
What &apos;s your wife &apos;s name ?
What &apos;re you so nervous about ?
He has more books than he can ever read .
I can come .
Get ready for school .
It was Sunday yesterday .
Tom gave us everything he had .
I thought I heard you .
I can &apos;t read this .
Tell me what has become of him .
Tom is going to do that for Mary .
You &apos;re carrying this too far .
I deserved it .
I think I understand it now .
Tom put his glasses on .
What am I going to do , Tom ?
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t married .
Tom forgot my birthday .
Today I have a lot of things to do .
Where else in Boston do you want to visit ?
A good book is the best of friends , the same today and forever .
Tom had a good reason to do that .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
What did you find ?
I &apos;m not doing this for the money .
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
Tom lives in an old building .
We hardly even talk anymore .
Open the door .
I don &apos;t think Tom did it .
He may be on the next train .
I don &apos;t want to visit Tom .
I can handle it .
Tom won &apos;t come to today &apos;s meeting .
We have no choice .
Tom was born in Australia .
Tom has written a book .
Your name isn &apos;t Tom , is it ?
Where did you buy these shoes ?
Who said you could do that ?
How did you guys meet ?
I am a bit crazy .
Don &apos;t let Tom drink beer .
I think I remember how to do that .
Tom , this is my brother , John .
I made that one .
What are we to do ?
We &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like eating .
Tom picked up his hat and put it back on .
Tom has gotten older and he doesn &apos;t go out as often as he used to .
I don &apos;t see a problem with this .
She has no one to speak to .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary does .
We &apos;ll be seeing you , Tom .
I can &apos;t answer your question .
Would you like a cup of milk ?
Tom never talked about it much .
Tom told me that he was cold .
It &apos;s time to go home .
I don &apos;t think Tom meant it .
I talked to her on the telephone .
He left immediately .
You have no idea what happened , do you ?
These shoes are too big for me .
We saw Tom do it .
Have you made your decision ?
I don &apos;t really like him .
Look at these .
I said nothing .
Tom was tired .
He had nothing to do with it .
Did you make it ?
I &apos;ll do that for Tom .
You should stay at home today .
I had to buy some food .
I want to study English .
I intended to have finished the work .
I don &apos;t understand French at all .
How do you know this ?
Tom will arrive soon .
Tom would &apos;ve helped us if we &apos;d asked him .
You need to stay awake .
This is the woman I told you about .
Maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
Maybe I went a little too far .
I only ate one piece of cake .
I feel bad today .
He was angry with his students .
Tom gave me something I needed .
Tom said that he was hungry .
Let us go home .
You &apos;ll love it .
Tom won &apos;t let me drive anymore .
Tom moved to Boston .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether he needs to do that or not .
What do you want me to do with these ?
This is just the type of car I want .
Tom dropped the children off at school .
I can &apos;t work like this .
Tom plays the piano .
I would like to address two questions .
I have a lot to do today .
We should try and get some sleep .
You know I can &apos;t .
I don &apos;t know where you live .
This school has many students .
What &apos;s your daughter &apos;s name ?
She lives with him .
I &apos;m doing this for him .
I wish I had a dog .
She &apos;s not a child .
Be careful what you do .
Let &apos;s talk over the matter .
She made me a cake .
I was not disappointed .
I want us to be together .
Tom may come , but then again , he may not .
I won &apos;t be busy tomorrow .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
This is Tom &apos;s room .
I &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t go on Monday .
Where &apos;s my father ?
Tom asked something .
I don &apos;t have a horse .
Who &apos;s supposed to eat all that ?
I am proud of never being late for school .
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it .
I &apos;ll take the bus .
The bus you want doesn &apos;t stop here .
Where have you been ?
I think it &apos;s a good idea .
We still haven &apos;t made a decision .
This one &apos;s OK .
I must speak with you alone .
Tom showed up just in time .
Did you tell Tom about this ?
Thanks for seeing me .
Tom and Mary are outraged .
I don &apos;t want to show it to Tom yet .
Who said it was going to be easy ?
You are a friend of Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
Today , I have a lot of homework .
You aren &apos;t yourself today .
We know what to do .
Have the children eaten yet ?
He can play tennis very well .
I &apos;d like a cup of coffee , please .
Tom is home alone with his dog .
This telephone is out of order .
If you want , you can go .
I don &apos;t want to study French .
I did that while Tom was sleeping .
She never thinks about him .
They are both good students .
Tom did that just a month ago .
I would like to meet him .
I had a fender bender on my way to work .
I hear you .
What do you guys have ?
Tom parties too much .
I saw Tom on television .
He works in a bank .
Tom is much older than I thought .
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
Tom wants you to have it .
I want you to leave right now .
Tom made it home OK .
You &apos;ve arrived too early .
When did she get married ?
You have him there .
I could &apos;ve died .
This milk has gone bad .
I have some things to take care of .
Last summer was very hot .
Are we done yet ?
I just don &apos;t believe that .
Why was everyone so surprised ?
I know her .
Tom took Mary to school .
Tom is taking too long .
The dog needs water .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like each other .
Thank you for coming .
I &apos;m older than you think I am .
He can speak and write French .
What do you think of these shoes ?
Tom is one person I &apos;ll never forget .
I have never been to the States .
I heard you talking on the phone .
He can &apos;t do it .
I will do it right now .
He will be back soon .
I went to the park yesterday .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
Tom kept his promise .
I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question .
I &apos;m not rich enough to buy that .
Tom could read when he was three .
Tom is afraid of me .
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;m not sure whether I really want that .
These keys are Tom &apos;s .
Are you absolutely sure ?
Tom wants me to do that for him .
I laid my new clothes on the bed .
That is no business of his .
Are you mad at me ?
I had no idea who she was .
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
I &apos;m here , aren &apos;t I ?
What did you find ?
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
It was well worth the trouble .
Tom knows the city very well .
Whatever you do , don &apos;t forget this .
Tom gets tired easily .
I don &apos;t need them .
That &apos;s not what I saw .
The cat was on the table .
You &apos;re too little .
How long do you plan to stay ?
Tom felt all alone .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Give Tom a second chance .
Who is taller , Tom or Mary ?
We should wait for help .
You drive too fast .
Could you bring me some water ?
I &apos;m not afraid at all .
I don &apos;t know if you remember me , but we met a couple of years ago in Boston .
I found the money .
I wish I could understand you better .
Tom found me a job .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
That wasn &apos;t so bad , was it ?
I don &apos;t know who that man is .
Tom got a little pie .
I should like to go for a swim .
This bicycle is Tom &apos;s .
Can you explain that ?
I asked Tom for his phone number .
Tom gives us money .
Have you eaten lunch yet ?
I &apos;m going to study French .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
Each of them has to write a report about what he saw .
Mary was my first girlfriend .
Tom wanted money .
It makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
Tom said you &apos;d do that for Mary .
Tom never listens to what the teacher says .
Tom and I don &apos;t do that .
Tom spent the night on the couch .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
Let me help .
You must show me how it works .
Do your homework now .
What &apos;ll you tell Tom ?
I like women .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
I only speak a little French .
How do you know that ?
Tom says he &apos;s not coming .
That &apos;s nothing new .
I have no idea how long it &apos;ll take .
Where did you say this came from ?
When did you buy this car ?
Tom says I can &apos;t stay home alone .
Why don &apos;t we try doing this again tomorrow ?
You must stay the night .
Who &apos;ll go ?
Tom has a picture of his wife on his desk .
Tom said nobody else was there .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
He looks a bit tired .
That &apos;ll do .
Tom has a beautiful voice .
Tom is playing in his room .
She was feeling kind of tired .
Tom went to Boston by car .
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
Who spoke ?
I should &apos;ve listened to Tom .
Tom is behind you .
You don &apos;t have to answer these questions .
Where are the keys ?
I &apos;m never too busy for you .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really talking to you .
The hat on the desk is Tom &apos;s .
I just wanted to get it over with .
I expect Tom will know what to do .
I &apos;d love to see this movie .
I do not understand her .
Come here , Tom .
How long has this been going on ?
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
Tom stayed quiet .
Tom and I have both been very busy .
They are much taller than us .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me about you .
My father &apos;s a doctor .
He should have kept his mouth shut .
I like being with Tom .
You were in danger .
I &apos;m going to wait here for you .
She &apos;s not as beautiful as her sister .
Tom has already said yes .
I &apos;ve paid you already .
I could not afford to buy a bicycle .
What do you think I &apos;m doing ?
Are you buying into this ?
That &apos;s the house I used to live in .
Where does this car come from ?
You know that better than I do .
This time is no different .
You have to help .
We had fun with them .
How long do you plan to stay in this country ?
We don &apos;t listen to each other enough .
I can &apos;t speak French .
We are going to have a baby next month .
I &apos;m just watching television .
Tom is here again .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
Tom never talked about it .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand .
Do you know why he wasn &apos;t at school ?
Tom said something to Mary in French .
Tom sometimes goes to work by car .
Tom and Mary are doing that .
Tom showed Mary a picture of John and another boy .
This cat is as big as that one .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you come or not .
You &apos;ve got my keys .
Can you make room for me ?
When did you buy it ?
I want to talk with your uncle .
You should go home .
I got it .
Are you sure you want to be alone ?
Tom still has feelings for you .
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom anything .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
Tom will visit Mary in Australia next month .
Do you know about that ?
Do you have kids ?
I hope to see you tomorrow .
I love my country .
I like it when you do that .
Did you phone me ?
Tom ! What are you doing ?
Do you know how many people are here ?
Where do you want to eat ?
I didn &apos;t understand what he said .
I &apos;m as tall as Tom .
Tom ought to do that .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
Tom is really late .
We found them .
You already know the truth .
They never found out the truth .
I &apos;m not certain , but I think so .
He has come from Boston .
This coat is too short on me .
He doesn &apos;t sleep .
I wasn &apos;t expecting that .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us either .
What does Tom do every day ?
I &apos;m not sure I can afford it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary everything .
French is one of the languages I &apos;ve always wanted to learn .
How &apos;re we doing ?
I may die tomorrow .
Tom believes he &apos;s right .
When could you do that ?
You &apos;re back .
This never would &apos;ve happened if you &apos;d done it the way I told you to do it .
It &apos;s not clear when he came here .
Why don &apos;t you believe me ?
I &apos;d say go for it .
You lost .
Tom should &apos;ve known .
Are you sure they can do this ?
Tom made Mary wait for a long time .
He wrote to me yesterday .
Tom is very good-looking .
It &apos;s what I want .
I should not have bought such a thing .
Would you like a glass of water ?
You know Tom won &apos;t do that , don &apos;t you ?
I saw her a week ago today .
Tom is the only friend I have .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
Tom relented .
That was somebody else &apos;s idea .
Tom made Mary very happy .
I just want you to know that Tom is safe .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
Tom was killed instantly .
Tell him to call me .
I never wanted you to go .
I don &apos;t quite believe what he says .
Tom said he was in love with you .
I know it &apos;s here somewhere .
It &apos;s rather hot out here .
Summer has come .
You were my friend .
Tom looked awake .
How can you be so calm ?
Do you want something to eat ?
You can make it .
This is too big .
Tom may be at home .
Tom will remain .
Have you already eaten supper ?
Tell me what I should &apos;ve done .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom must &apos;ve died .
I am well .
He is said to be rich .
Do you really want to be here ?
Tom had a knife .
I want more than that .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I &apos;d do it differently .
Nobody can stop me !
Tom was young .
He is here !
The train hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
I have children .
Be quiet , all of you .
If I knew the truth , I would tell you .
Yesterday was hot .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
It &apos;s good to see you , too .
Tom won &apos;t think that &apos;s funny .
I thought that Tom loved Mary .
I heard her sing a song .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
It wasn &apos;t mine .
You &apos;re quiet .
What are we going to do about Tom ?
I just want to forget about it .
The dog is dead .
It &apos;s time to go .
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
There was not a tree in sight .
No one has that right .
He didn &apos;t want to do it .
What &apos;s going on out there ?
You can say that again .
I think it makes sense .
I know you like coffee .
That is out of the question .
She speaks relatively fast .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Tom may not come .
I &apos;m a bit hungry .
Who are those children ?
That film is for children .
Let &apos;s start here .
I took off my hat .
What does Tom see in you ?
Did you remember to go to the library ?
That was really fun .
I &apos;ve got some things to take care of .
Is this book yours ?
Tom didn &apos;t have much money .
You have three cats .
Everyone makes mistakes .
You will do exactly as I say .
Why don &apos;t you want me to tell anyone ?
I believe it to be true .
Maybe she knows the answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem like himself .
We know them .
Why is Tom home ?
I know exactly what I have to do .
You &apos;re welcome to move back to Boston .
She will be coming to see us again soon .
You can sit with me .
Tom is out in the garden .
I &apos;m a little hungry .
How long have you been a doctor here ?
We &apos;ve been there before .
Why does Tom always look so tired ?
This is the best ship I &apos;ve ever been on .
I just started reading this book .
I didn &apos;t want you to read that .
You &apos;re not satisfied , are you ?
Nobody saw anything .
I can &apos;t get that out of my mind .
You shouldn &apos;t go to work .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Tom sat down on the desk .
Tom is about the same age as Mary .
Where did Tom buy this book ?
I don &apos;t think Tom understands .
I know that Tom has been sick .
There is a book on the table .
I thought you were going out with Tom .
Tom must be busier now than he was last year .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
Do you know if Tom is here ?
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
I pretended not to understand what he was saying .
We &apos;re going alone .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
My parents will be proud of me .
You deserve more .
It &apos;s up to you to make a choice .
You &apos;re my woman .
He was supposed to go to school .
This question isn &apos;t easy .
What do you enjoy doing ?
Tom walks slowly .
How long did Tom say he &apos;d be in Boston ?
Tom had nothing to lose .
Why do you think that I &apos;m thinking about you ?
He gets up early .
I think Tom knows why I &apos;m here .
I know what this is about .
They know what happened .
Tom is getting nervous .
I told Tom that I wasn &apos;t busy .
You should ask Tom first .
I must apologize .
I think that Tom is dangerous .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
Open your mouth !
Here is your key .
You made it happen .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I &apos;ve just read this book .
I learned how to do that just last month .
He &apos;s in grave danger .
Tom knows he &apos;s right .
What could you have done ?
I like your garden and the flowers in it .
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
You do good work .
Tom is well aware of what is going on at the office .
Please write it down .
Please don &apos;t ask me to do this again .
Do we have time ?
This problem is difficult for me to solve .
Tom never told me he wanted to go to Boston with us .
Does Tom have a secret ?
About how much money do you have ?
What did you tell Tom ?
Tom is out .
Where did you buy that ?
It &apos;s a present for you .
I hate it when this happens .
I don &apos;t like big dogs .
He told him to study .
There &apos;s no film in this camera .
I &apos;m happy to hear that .
I want to sleep a little more .
I can live with that .
They live in a small house .
It is good to see you .
Tom considered it .
I wonder where Tom studied French .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
Can I help you ?
That boy said his name was Tom .
Tom is standing in the garden .
He &apos;s already married .
He took back what he had said about her .
Maybe this weekend we could go to the beach together .
That was different .
Tom is not one of us .
I want one , too .
Tom likes the idea .
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
When will we go back ?
I &apos;m not ready yet .
Tom is waiting for us in the car .
Why are you so interested in him ?
Tom was surprised how well Mary could swim .
Tom lives somewhere around here .
I bought a new car .
We &apos;re very disappointed in you .
Do you have somewhere to stay ?
You need to work very hard .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
How does Tom do that ?
Tom has gone to school .
He arrived at the station at seven .
Tom and I have an understanding .
He doesn &apos;t listen .
Why didn &apos;t you tell anyone ?
I &apos;m a good boy .
Do you want me to help you find Tom ?
Tom is with me .
Wouldn &apos;t you like to drink some tea ?
Tom knows us well .
I &apos;m not going to ask again .
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
We don &apos;t need these things .
Take Tom with you .
Tom , what are you doing here ?
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
Tom has been sick a lot lately .
You might have to do this all by yourself .
I &apos;m not worried about it .
Listen up .
Is he still here ?
Tom watches TV every day .
I cannot afford to buy a new bicycle .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along very well .
That didn &apos;t use to happen .
The question is how much .
How do you like my new hat ?
I seldom go to Boston anymore .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
I can &apos;t understand the meaning .
Health means everything .
Has Tom finished eating ?
I walked the whole way to the station .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Don &apos;t ever do that again .
Tom asked me for something I couldn &apos;t give him .
Tom gave Mary a call .
Come with me .
She sat next to me .
I &apos;m too tired .
You know who I am , don &apos;t you ?
Ask her her name .
We have been here for three days .
Tom gave up too soon .
I don &apos;t know them .
No one knows what &apos;ll happen in the future .
Does it matter to you when we come ?
What happened out here ?
You can &apos;t trust what she says .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
Tom had no one to help him .
Why are you at home ?
I want to sleep .
It &apos;s very nice of you to help me .
I can &apos;t explain it any better than that . I wish I could .
I saw Tom do that .
Tom continued reading the book .
Tom seems tired .
Tom looked about .
We &apos;ll meet Tom there .
I don &apos;t speak a word of French .
Tom comes from Australia .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to know what he was doing .
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
Is that true ?
I &apos;m late for lunch .
I love driving .
Why are we here ?
What would you change ?
What is she like ?
I bought it yesterday .
I don &apos;t think Tom speaks French .
What we do is up to you .
Tom &apos;s wasted .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to go .
His parents took him for a walk .
What have you decided ?
Tom wants to wait .
These are very big apples .
How come you know so much about Tom ?
I &apos;ll be in my office from ten tomorrow .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
I &apos;ll show you that I am right .
Thank you for coming .
They can &apos;t see me .
Tom lives from hand to mouth .
This is our land now .
Tom asked Mary for advice .
I should &apos;ve studied more when I was young .
How long was Tom sick ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any chance of winning .
A car went by .
I will have to work on Sunday .
We can &apos;t do that .
Everything is possible .
Can anyone tell me the time ?
It was the wrong thing to do .
All is well that ends well .
I don &apos;t like Boston that much .
We love our school .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had seen us ?
Do you want to live in Boston ?
I &apos;m certain I saw Tom .
I &apos;ll ask Tom to meet you tomorrow at three o &apos;clock .
I think my parents know .
Nobody believes me .
I knew you were going to ask that .
Let me say one thing .
What are you two up to ?
We &apos;ve made it .
How are you and Tom getting along ?
My birthday &apos;s not for another month .
Somebody has stolen my suitcase .
What did you have for lunch today ?
Tell me how that &apos;s possible .
I &apos;ll come without fail tomorrow morning .
I think you should eat something .
How many years have you been married ?
You seem to enjoy doing that .
That &apos;s all we know .
I should talk to Tom .
He has been sick for a week .
I don &apos;t know why Tom and Mary don &apos;t like each other .
The mother told her daughter to do it herself .
Have you read the book yet ?
Tom seems really happy .
What do you know about what happened ?
She doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
I &apos;m never going to be able to do that without your help .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom lives .
I &apos;ve got nothing to do .
She has a few books .
Tom doesn &apos;t know which way to go .
Tom tried that .
I don &apos;t want to hurt her .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
How did you find Tom ?
It wasn &apos;t your fault .
I wasn &apos;t busy .
Are those flowers for me ?
I &apos;m interested in getting a hat like this .
This river is dangerous to swim in .
The train arrived in London .
Tom says that he believes everything I say .
I asked Tom .
I saw her last week .
They bought a new car .
Tom is going to love you guys .
We &apos;ve got a problem here .
Tom is going to know what to do .
I can give it a shot .
Tom said that he wanted to talk to me after school .
Can you see without your glasses ?
I don &apos;t understand your question .
He is a good doctor .
That keeps happening to me .
I thought it might be true .
Let &apos;s see what Tom can do for us .
Did you ask Tom why ?
What don &apos;t you like about Tom ?
Do you have children ?
Maybe Tom can do it .
I want to go to the movies today .
When did he go ?
We are worried about you .
She felt like dancing .
Tom and the others left early .
Where did you find Tom ?
Tom is waiting for me .
What I &apos;m saying is quite true .
I would like to hear your opinion .
He went to Boston by car .
I know how important this is to you .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me anything about it ?
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
We &apos;ll arrive in three hours if we drive .
How do you like Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that right away .
Tom is standing behind Mary in this picture .
I &apos;m worried about what &apos;ll happen if Tom comes .
I didn &apos;t say it was going to be easy .
They were surprised by what they saw .
Tom got married three days ago .
Isn &apos;t that what I said ?
I &apos;d like to try doing this without your help .
Tom must &apos;ve been scared .
You need me more than I need you .
I went to Boston last year .
I don &apos;t ever want to leave this room .
That &apos;s a big mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to read a book .
I &apos;ve never felt so happy in my life .
Tom will walk .
Tom says that he knows you .
I am glad to be with you .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
You better go .
Do you want kids ?
This is too easy for him .
I lied about doing that .
Why did I do that ?
Tom wants to get rich quick .
Tom says he enjoys speaking French .
You &apos;re looking good !
He could not answer that question .
She didn &apos;t tell me her name .
You still have much to learn .
My sister likes Tom .
Don &apos;t say anything .
Tom found the work easy .
He did not come .
I don &apos;t care much for coffee .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a computer .
I was nervous , too .
I &apos;m well .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
I am happy .
Is Tom there alone ?
Tom , if you &apos;re not going I &apos;m not going either .
I still love you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t care .
You must make your parents happy .
I met a friend I hadn &apos;t seen for three years .
Where &apos;s your friend ?
I keep a dog .
Did Tom talk to you ?
This is going to be fine .
You &apos;ll see it .
Did you phone me ?
How are you ?
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom .
I want to know what &apos;s out there .
I &apos;m very proud of you .
Tom has my car .
When were you in Boston ?
We were in love .
I can &apos;t die here .
What do you want to do ?
Did you see Tom today ?
She works for a hospital .
Tom , what do you say ?
I really don &apos;t feel like talking right now .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
You &apos;re driving me crazy .
Tom asked me whether I was hungry .
Tom has no friends .
I know where to look .
I &apos;m not leaving here .
You &apos;ve already made your decision , haven &apos;t you ?
I just wish I knew what to say to my husband .
Tom opened his eyes .
I went for a walk with my son .
Why are you doing this ?
How big you are !
Tom looks like he &apos;s sorry .
How many cats do you have ?
Let Tom do it .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
Tom has already finished his lunch .
Nobody lives in this house .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
Tom only has eyes for Mary .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
I don &apos;t really care what you think .
Don &apos;t worry about it .
We have to do that this week .
I can &apos;t answer your question .
It was Tom &apos;s fault .
It &apos;s not that cold .
Tom isn &apos;t that much taller than Mary .
She speaks English really well .
It couldn &apos;t be Tom .
Look at that one there .
I saw a boy crossing the street .
Thank you for this , Tom .
Tom bought a table .
Can I say something ?
I never heard you play it better .
I want to drink some water .
It isn &apos;t a hospital .
It &apos;s all right .
I wondered whether Tom wanted to dance .
I could not get out .
I &apos;ve never had this kind of problem at work .
It &apos;s too easy .
You &apos;d better give up smoking .
Tom told Mary his age .
I came here to see you .
I don &apos;t have a problem with this .
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
You are as tall as I am .
He did the work in two days .
Tom took his shirt off .
You need a new hat .
Doesn &apos;t that make you happy ?
She is willing to do anything for me .
Did he go home yesterday ?
Please feel free to ask me any question .
He was suddenly very happy .
I am going to write a letter tomorrow .
I &apos;m very concerned about your health .
Did you read it at all ?
You should be able to walk in a few days .
You didn &apos;t try hard enough .
That sofa is less expensive than this table .
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
We want you to be happy .
I &apos;m glad I could help you .
I was invited to dinner .
I don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
Aren &apos;t those your parents ?
I don &apos;t want to know about this .
We don &apos;t have a car .
I don &apos;t know why Tom went to Boston .
I managed to finish the book .
I want to be careful .
He gave him a book .
I don &apos;t know you .
I don &apos;t like to be alone .
I need a new computer .
That isn &apos;t French .
They should have arrived home by now .
Tom met with an accident .
I &apos;m not very busy .
I asked Tom to do that .
Didn &apos;t you hear her speaking French ?
I can &apos;t do it either .
I &apos;m about ready .
Tom asked me to help him with his homework .
Why do you want to take a taxi ?
Let &apos;s eat now .
They &apos;re doing OK .
If this is your knife , then I have lost mine .
We know everything .
It is not worth repairing this camera .
It was all my fault .
We &apos;ll try .
I &apos;m really sorry .
I like to walk .
Can we talk ?
It &apos;s very hot in here .
I &apos;ll give you this money .
You can &apos;t buy it anywhere but there .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
I &apos;m surprised Tom didn &apos;t show .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
Everyone is different .
He never listens to me .
Tom is happy to be alive .
Can you give me your phone number ?
I &apos;d like a word with you in private .
We started to walk .
It is up to you .
Why do you care about this ?
Let &apos;s go and see Tom .
I knew he was rich , but I didn &apos;t think he was that rich .
What did you learn ?
Tom knew that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
This isn &apos;t for me .
That &apos;s not a proper thing to say .
I know what I &apos;d say .
Books are my best friends .
Tom and I sometimes work together .
We have two kids .
You know better .
They &apos;re children .
Do you want to help me ?
You and Tom must be so happy .
We &apos;re out of beer .
They &apos;ll come .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I saw you so happy .
I believe Tom .
No one knows what to do .
Do you want a glass of water ?
I &apos;m offering you a deal .
I almost feel bad for Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a car .
Tom hurt himself .
What about us ?
Tom seems very happy .
I don &apos;t quite know how it happened .
I could see Tom was still alive .
I never learned about any of this in school .
I &apos;m not going unless Tom goes .
I think we &apos;re all a bit crazy .
She gave him some money .
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
You should apologize .
They were dead .
The hospital is near here .
Let me help you with your work .
Tom wanted to leave , but Mary wanted to stay a little longer .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
I won &apos;t need you .
How did you first meet Tom ?
He &apos;s not sure he &apos;s ready .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like my family .
Tom did what he had been told .
I know what his name is .
I have a friend living in London .
Have you seen her ?
My father made me what I am .
Have you talked to Tom about this ?
He took a taxi both ways .
He came from another country .
Tom wants to live in Boston .
We are going to have a baby .
You &apos;re very rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t help you .
You must tell us .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
We &apos;re not happy with this .
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school .
I don &apos;t want to know .
I wanted to go to the beach with Tom .
I don &apos;t feel like sleeping anymore .
Tom and Mary almost got married last summer .
The bus will be here in a few minutes .
Who &apos;ll come ?
You can &apos;t do anything right now .
He says he will come .
They &apos;re not happy .
I believe in Tom .
How did you get Tom to give you so much money ?
I couldn &apos;t remember ever having met her .
What time is it in Boston ?
We want to get out of here as soon as we can .
Tom will know .
This is what I like about you .
I &apos;m not afraid of death .
Tom is in his office waiting .
Tom will always love you .
Can you take me to the airport , please ?
Tom saw me do that .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
I spoke loudly so that everyone could hear me .
Do you want some more tea ?
Where &apos;ve you been ?
I was too astonished to speak .
Why didn &apos;t you ask me ?
We &apos;re working on it .
My father has been busy .
He looked pretty tired .
The boy is wearing glasses .
I wanted to read a book .
I love the people here .
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon .
She isn &apos;t married .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Tom can say &quot; I can only speak French &quot; in thirty languages .
Do what he says .
Tom seemed to remember me .
I know this has been hard for you .
I like this school .
This is what I want to do .
I knew Tom was different .
Where &apos;s the nearest hospital ?
Tom has something in his hand .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
Tom didn &apos;t understand a thing .
Is he Tom ?
My parents are in Australia .
You didn &apos;t have to do it straight away .
I thought you might be interested in this .
Tom chased after Mary .
How long have you known him ?
I wish the rain would stop .
How long have Tom and Mary been married ?
He often doesn &apos;t come to school .
Ask her what her name is .
I wish you had not told him about the plan .
Tell Tom he should do that .
I want a boyfriend .
You &apos;re still in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I know he did it .
You have a task to complete .
I almost never watch TV .
There is no other way .
We couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
You can &apos;t have this .
Tom found his glasses and put them on .
What did you expect ?
Where did you find your key ?
I would do it if I had more time on my hands .
I &apos;ll stay at home tomorrow .
Is that really true ?
Tom and Mary have decided to get married next month .
How many people know about this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary should do that .
Tom wouldn &apos;t eat .
He often plays the guitar .
I &apos;m no longer tired .
I don &apos;t want a boyfriend .
Tom is still studying French .
When can I see you ?
Your shoes are here . Where are mine ?
You have no idea where we are , do you ?
You &apos;re afraid of him .
I have everything .
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and his three children .
My sister didn &apos;t help me .
I wish I had more to give you .
I remember the day I met you .
Look at us .
I &apos;ll take this one .
It &apos;s raining here .
I think he &apos;s happy .
I think things are going well .
Come to my house whenever you like .
Tom wants to be strong .
I think you understand me .
I want to get married and I want to have kids .
The game isn &apos;t over yet .
Do you believe what he said ?
What &apos;s the point in doing that ?
Where is your sister ?
My parents don &apos;t know .
Tom walked into his apartment .
Look out there .
I think everybody is ready .
Don &apos;t worry about your family .
I don &apos;t know when , but it &apos;s likely to happen before next Monday .
I missed the train . I should have come earlier .
Tom said he &apos;d like to have another cup of coffee .
Tom , we have a problem .
You will know soon enough .
What do they want from us ?
You &apos;d better be careful .
We have dinner at seven .
Tom made me angry .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
He isn &apos;t able to do that .
This isn &apos;t real .
She can &apos;t cook well .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is .
I suppose you want to go home .
Tom seems busy .
I let you down .
Their cakes are good .
Not all of us can speak French .
This is what I want to do .
Tom is going to Boston .
What &apos;s Tom got against me ?
You have to help us .
That &apos;s the car I &apos;m going to buy .
Will you let me try once more ?
Tom knows he has no choice .
I &apos;m now learning how to do that .
Here comes Tom .
I am thinking about my children .
Tom never spoke to Mary again .
I &apos;d like you to go there .
Tom said he &apos;ll look after me .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that by herself .
It &apos;s difficult to explain .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing we can do .
How did you come by these books ?
Who goes there ?
Something &apos;s not right .
Where was he going ?
Tom worked hard all summer .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
When are you coming back to the office ?
Why are you in my house ?
Tom said nobody had been injured .
Where am I going to go ?
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
I think that &apos;s the reason Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Tom knows that Mary didn &apos;t win .
That &apos;d be impossible .
I &apos;m offering you a deal .
Tom &apos;s not busy .
I &apos;m not a bit tired .
I know what &apos;s at stake .
Tom likes money .
Yesterday was Monday .
Since Tom was speaking in French , I couldn &apos;t understand what he was saying .
How else can we do this ?
What do you think they are ?
Don &apos;t you think I know my own father ?
Tom is cooperating .
It &apos;s not always like this .
I am very sorry for what I said .
Tom and his wife co-authored a book about Boston .
Tom said that he thought that it could happen in Boston , too .
Tom will tell you .
I have a daughter .
You have no one but yourself to blame .
Tom and Mary are waiting with John .
He stayed in London over a month .
Tom loves you very much .
I like them .
We haven &apos;t seen anyone .
It was Tom &apos;s fault .
Where has Tom gone ?
What else do you need ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
I am not sure .
How well can you dance ?
Tom took off his watch .
Tom told me that Mary died on Monday .
I don &apos;t know how to say what I want to say in French .
This is what you have to do .
Are you at home ?
What made you think of that ?
You &apos;re in great danger .
There are some books on Tom &apos;s desk .
Did Tom go , too ?
I didn &apos;t get the point of his speech .
I &apos;m coming back .
She works all night .
That happens to me all the time .
That &apos;s your funeral .
You should try to be more like Tom .
It is hardly raining .
I just had to see this for myself .
Tom and Mary are both older than John .
I &apos;ve got to get back to Boston .
I see him once in a while .
Tom hasn &apos;t come home yet .
My uncle gave me a book .
Where is the nearest telephone ?
Are you Tom &apos;s daughter ?
Why can &apos;t we just be friends ?
He abandoned the idea .
Let me know .
Tom turned down the offer .
I &apos;m tired of being sick .
Why do we need to learn this ?
These days I &apos;m very busy .
I can &apos;t tell you everything .
Is it far from here ?
This is very good .
I want to be happy again .
You &apos;ve got until 2 : 30 tomorrow to get this done .
Why isn &apos;t Tom helping ?
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised .
That &apos;s a pretty good question .
I &apos;m fairly certain I heard Tom say he wasn &apos;t ready to do that .
Tom is waiting for you .
I have just eaten lunch .
Please tell me how to get to the bank .
Tell Tom why .
You are old enough to know this .
I wonder why Tom left Mary .
Tom could do it .
It is easy to answer the question .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
Are you good at cooking ?
What should I eat for lunch today ?
That would take too long .
Can you explain that ?
Tom knows we know it .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
You &apos;re going to be proud of me .
Mary likes to wear flowers in her hair .
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t know Tom would be here today .
Tom left for home well over an hour ago .
I &apos;m so sorry to hear that .
I realized I wasn &apos;t ready .
Who &apos;ll succeed ?
See you later .
I have to be up at six .
I have another question .
It &apos;s more fun than drinking coffee .
They may go .
I &apos;ve been here almost three years now .
We &apos;ll do it this way from now on .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the last three days .
I thought about you .
Tom slept most of the afternoon .
What does this have to do with us ?
I &apos;m glad Tom left .
Tom is often late for work .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t completely alone .
It &apos;s your home .
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour .
I know that I know it , but I can &apos;t remember it .
I can &apos;t live without a TV .
I had fish for dinner last night .
Nobody cares what you think .
They can &apos;t do this .
I want you to read this book .
Where did everybody go ?
I continued reading the book .
You can &apos;t pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
I &apos;m leaving .
He read this book yesterday .
Tom still didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom would &apos;ve turned thirty next month if he hadn &apos;t died in the accident .
Do you know what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
We &apos;ll have to live with that .
Do Tom and Mary know why you &apos;re here ?
Tom said he was aching all over .
Tom looked for the key .
Why didn &apos;t you just pay Tom ?
I &apos;ll never do that again .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
I &apos;ve been able to read since I was six years old .
We are against war .
Tom needs someone to talk to .
All is well with me .
That wasn &apos;t a mistake .
Have you been in Boston long ?
What does your father do ?
It &apos;s too good to be true .
I bought a lot of books .
Tom isn &apos;t that strong .
What happened to my bag ?
We don &apos;t have long .
You don &apos;t need to tell Tom everything .
There &apos;s no one but me here .
This is my dog .
Tom says he &apos;s fine .
Have you eaten yet ?
She &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
I &apos;m there for you .
I said I wasn &apos;t ready .
I just came from my house .
I can &apos;t answer that question now .
Your hair &apos;s beautiful .
I &apos;m not your son .
Tom &apos;s awake .
I would like some more water .
Where &apos;s the cat ?
You have my word .
Tom became angry .
I want to take Tom home .
Tom was standing .
Tom looked back over his shoulder .
I know something about it .
Tom likes Mary more than he likes Alice .
I am ready to do anything for you .
What do you want to say ?
Mary showed the letter to me .
Isn &apos;t there anyone else who can help you ?
Can you open it ?
How did you meet your wife ?
We were supposed to be here two weeks ago .
I know exactly where Tom is .
I don &apos;t want to go there again .
How long do we have to wait ?
I know you think this is crazy .
She &apos;s two years older than him .
You can &apos;t pretend that it didn &apos;t happen .
Have a good look at this picture .
I didn &apos;t really understand that .
He wants to talk to you .
This is OK .
This is something Tom made for you .
This has nothing to do with you .
What is your decision ?
Tom would help us if he could .
Are you here ?
We &apos;re not like that .
They have come .
Why didn &apos;t you get married ?
Have you made your decision yet ?
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you sick ?
Where &apos;s the hospital ?
Why can &apos;t you come ?
You didn &apos;t have to come into the office today .
I had nothing to do with her .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s father .
Tom is teaching me French .
Is there anyone who speaks English ?
Tom knows that we know .
It &apos;s hot .
Tom is smashed .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
Look at that house .
You &apos;re my age .
Life isn &apos;t always simple .
He &apos;s not one of us .
I asked Tom a few questions .
This really isn &apos;t a good time .
The clock struck ten .
Do you have a book to read on the airplane ?
I think Tom said that .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like me ?
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
She thinks that she &apos;s always right .
Do you know what she said ?
I called him up .
It is no use studying when you are sleepy .
How long were you at school today ?
I don &apos;t think Tom understands that .
I &apos;m taking Tom with me .
Who won the election ?
Tom admitted his mistakes .
She is anxious about your health .
What does she think about my car ?
We &apos;re correct .
What books have you read in French ?
Our school is right near the park .
Tom suggested we leave immediately .
I &apos;ve been in business thirty years .
I don &apos;t have that much money .
I &apos;ve been working .
You were supposed to be there by 2 : 30 .
Tom &apos;s thirty .
Who came ?
I don &apos;t want to hear any more .
We plan on staying a week .
Have you already met him ?
Tom is going to love Boston .
This is not a game .
We &apos;ve already eaten .
You &apos;re not going to like what I &apos;m about to say .
I read a book today .
I know Tom is tired .
He died three years ago .
I &apos;m not sure of anything .
Tom didn &apos;t hear Mary enter the room .
It &apos;s already seven o &apos;clock .
I think I &apos;m love with you .
I &apos;m at home .
Tom had a plan .
We saw you .
He &apos;s eight years old .
That &apos;s his horse .
I have to go to sleep .
Did Tom see anything ?
No one understands me .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
I slid the door open .
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
Love hurts .
Tom could write his name when he was three .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
Do you have Tom &apos;s phone number ?
He is not wearing a hat .
Tom wasn &apos;t even there .
Tom did his homework and then went to bed .
There was more than enough food .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s brother .
I have often heard him say that .
Tom will always love you .
Come here . I need to tell you something .
What &apos;s the matter , Tom ?
There are many people in the park .
Tom doesn &apos;t look much older than Mary .
Both of my parents have passed away .
Tom has a picture of his wife on his desk .
Tom remains in Boston .
Tom and Mary stared into each other &apos;s eyes .
The students ought to study more .
What happened to you last night ?
What do you think she is doing now ?
This man is very , very old .
All I have is a book .
Why don &apos;t we ask Tom to help ?
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
You can &apos;t say that .
Tom has already had lunch .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Boston .
They don &apos;t know me .
Are you my father ?
We all speak French .
How is this possible ?
Tom still has a lot to learn .
Have you ever read a book written about Japan ?
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is .
Do you know where Boston is ?
I don &apos;t have any other choice .
Tom had fun .
Tom can afford to buy Mary anything she wants .
He doesn &apos;t have any friends .
I want it .
Would you like to come over to my house ?
I love your daughter .
I still need to talk to Tom .
I just don &apos;t love Tom .
A male friend of mine called on me yesterday .
Tom is still waiting for you .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
What did your wife say ?
I &apos;m not exactly surprised .
What school did you go to ?
I found this book very difficult .
One language is never enough .
That &apos;s a problem .
Do you mind much ?
He &apos;s never been better .
I &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking about what you said .
You have to stay awake .
I know who was in Tom &apos;s office at 2 : 30 .
He put in a good word for me .
If I had time , I would study French .
She asked me to open the window .
I will speak with you tomorrow .
It &apos;s going to be all right .
It isn &apos;t at all clear .
I &apos;m glad you invited me .
Tom left Mary in the room by herself .
I &apos;m not rich .
Tom looks a bit tired .
Tom will pay for what he did .
What time is it now in Boston ?
Tom plays piano better than Mary .
He &apos;ll probably win in the next election .
It &apos;s all our fault .
He always plays well .
That &apos;s his business .
What &apos;s wrong with me ?
Why do you think Tom isn &apos;t here ?
We need more space .
I &apos;m not your daughter .
Is eating less meat a good idea ?
They got here yesterday .
That &apos;s not good for your health .
Tom is always on the go .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that at all .
She looks young .
I don &apos;t go in for that sort of thing .
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
I know most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
Are we all here ?
Tom loves books .
Oh , it &apos;s quite simple , really .
How about a cup of coffee ?
Did you like that ?
Where is Father ?
I &apos;d love to dance with you .
Please tell me the truth .
That has nothing to do with you .
Tom was here with Mary yesterday afternoon .
What did you tell Tom ?
That &apos;s not what we want .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
It &apos;s not that interesting .
I forget your telephone number .
Tom said that he wanted to forget about what happened .
Where are you taking me ?
We &apos;ve already met .
There &apos;s still a fair bit of work to be done .
My hour has not yet come .
Tom felt happy .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy here .
He gave away all his money .
The job &apos;s not done yet .
Why does everyone need to learn English ?
Tom told his friends that he was going to Boston .
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
Tom has made many new friends .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
Don &apos;t take Tom too seriously .
How big is your house ?
I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m scared .
We &apos;ve already done that .
I want you to help Tom .
Can you tell me the time ?
Tom is nice .
Aren &apos;t you going to ask Tom ?
Can &apos;t you help us ?
Tom may know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
You are expected to do a good job .
She couldn &apos;t look him in the face .
Tom likes them both .
I love your son .
There was nothing for us to drink .
I take a taxi to the train station once or twice a week .
Will you have some more tea ?
I &apos;d like to go to Boston .
Tom got there long after we did .
Anything might happen .
This is for you , I think .
I think what we just heard was Tom &apos;s voice .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary is .
Could you give me some advice ?
Please don &apos;t be mad .
Why do you think ?
Is Tom over there with you ?
You may be correct .
I won &apos;t be here next month .
Tom ran for his life .
Tom knows Mary better than I do .
Tom says it &apos;s up to Mary .
How old were you then ?
Do they know that we know ?
What happened to the others ?
I met a friend .
It makes no difference whether you go or not .
My mother is seriously ill .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do that .
Did you speak French yesterday ?
May I visit you tomorrow ?
You have to believe in something .
I &apos;m getting tired of losing .
From what he says , I don &apos;t think we should go .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t want this .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like it .
How kind of you !
I was just trying to be friendly .
Why don &apos;t you want me to know ?
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I &apos;m going to Boston on Monday .
Why don &apos;t you go alone ?
There &apos;s been a lot of rain this year .
I was surprised when Tom told me why he needed to do that .
You &apos;re supposed to be working .
Tom asked Mary if she was free the next day .
I wish she could have come .
I &apos;m surprised to hear you say that .
Is that what you want ?
I didn &apos;t say that .
This is the one I &apos;ll use .
Did you play tennis yesterday ?
Is there anything more I can do ?
I want to do something with my life .
Don &apos;t give me that .
What do you see out there ?
Speaking English is very difficult for me .
Tom worked all day yesterday .
Tom isn &apos;t the only one here who knows French .
Where did you find the keys ?
Anybody can do that .
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
His brother is married , but he doesn &apos;t have children .
We &apos;re here to help .
There &apos;s not enough water .
Tom &apos;s strong .
I need to buy one .
We enjoyed watching the TV .
I come from the future .
Tom came to see Mary .
He &apos;s just evil .
What else did Tom eat ?
What is your reason for your being late to work ?
Everything I told you is the truth .
How do you know Tom is there ?
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston longer .
Tom always had a lot of money .
My family didn &apos;t have much money .
Speaking French is a lot of fun .
Tom didn &apos;t learn anything in school .
Tom isn &apos;t funny , but Mary is .
Tom didn &apos;t fall .
I know that I know it , but I can &apos;t remember it .
What do you usually do on weekends ?
We have plans to visit Boston .
The kids are at school .
I thought I &apos;d left it at home .
I think I had better not say anything about it .
I shouldn &apos;t have told you anything .
I saw nothing at all .
I think that &apos;s Tom .
You can &apos;t stay for long .
I &apos;d ask Tom to do that .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
He always takes his time in everything that he does .
I have two children .
Tom barely spoke .
I should just tell Tom the truth .
Tom never saw Mary .
Tom usually eats lunch alone .
I don &apos;t want you to do that .
We had a slight accident .
I &apos;ll do what you want .
Do you believe in life after death ?
I was beginning to worry .
I &apos;ll do that by myself .
What has happened to him ?
We worry about your future .
They &apos;ve been out there a long time .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
Tom said that he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom knows who they are .
He &apos;s a big boy .
Tom went back to his room and lay down .
I &apos;m sorry it worked out this way .
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
It &apos;s mine , not his .
No one has seen Tom .
I will always love you .
You &apos;d be amazed how often Tom doesn &apos;t do his homework .
Don &apos;t come again .
Please come and see me again .
Do you know where Tom lives ?
Tom usually walks to school with Mary .
I only speak French at home with my parents .
What &apos;s wrong , Tom ?
The cat seems to want some water .
I think they saw you .
If Tom really liked me , he wouldn &apos;t have done that .
You had better not read this book .
The police are here .
He never fails to do what he says .
I &apos;ve studied French for years .
We just don &apos;t notice it anymore .
Tom is looking at Mary .
That doesn &apos;t belong to us .
What did she say ?
They don &apos;t know who I am .
This work has to be finished by Monday .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
I &apos;ve seen them .
Tom will probably be busy tomorrow .
I stood up slowly .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
Do you like to be alone ?
We &apos;re not in love . We &apos;re just good friends .
You &apos;re not feeling well , are you ?
He can &apos;t drive .
Tom said that Mary likes you .
How &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
We get on OK .
You shouldn &apos;t do his work .
Don &apos;t ask for money .
Is that all you have to say to me ?
Let &apos;s just be friends .
I was so cold .
I &apos;ll meet you there in one hour .
What time is it ?
Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
Today is your birthday .
Nobody knows where Tom went .
You only live once .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
Tom will come later .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
Is your husband at home ?
What do you have to do ?
Who is the boss of this company ?
I &apos;m busy , too .
My mother loves me .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know a thing about it .
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
Tom plays the guitar better than anyone else I know .
Tom was right about one thing .
It was here that I saw her .
I remember asking an old man the way .
Tom was satisfied .
Will you please shut the door ?
Everybody dies .
I feel very sorry about that .
Do you have any idea who that was ?
Tom kept me waiting for more than three hours .
I &apos;m taking Tom home with me .
I hope that you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
My father has many books .
Isn &apos;t that where we first met ?
Tom became quiet .
I &apos;m sorry . I don &apos;t have a lot of time .
Tom is very kind to us .
What were they doing there ?
What you did made Tom happy .
That &apos;s all Tom wants .
Tom is no longer here .
Tom slammed the door shut .
I don &apos;t blame Tom .
They &apos;re like family .
Do you want me to drive you home ?
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
What &apos;s the name of that piece ?
I can ride a bike .
Someone has been in my room .
It &apos;s bad for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t help me .
We go to school by bus .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary what had happened .
You &apos;ve won !
I got sick last week .
Are you ready to eat ?
She &apos;s being nice to me .
I &apos;ll let you know later .
I know both of them .
I dislike eggs .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
What else do you want me to do ?
I believe I have now told you everything .
Tom came to my rescue .
Much more can be done .
I want him to read this .
I can &apos;t explain anything .
You may be correct .
We have to get it done now .
What do you think &apos;s out there ?
Let &apos;s not talk about that now .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
You must really be proud of yourself .
Just keep your hands where I can see them .
I need to remember to buy some milk .
I think Tom was speaking French .
I am happy with my girlfriend .
Maybe Tom can help you .
Give me just a little .
No one likes me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
That was our plan .
Give me your opinion , please .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
This door will not open .
He thought I was my brother .
I know you like me .
Are you the one who wrote this ?
My brother &apos;s name is Tom .
Where did you stay in Boston ?
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
Do you have one a little bigger than these ?
I look forward to it .
I just want to do my job .
I want to know who you are .
I never want to leave here .
Do you want to know who did this ?
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
This room is large enough .
I wish I &apos;d been there .
I ought to have written the letter yesterday .
That boy is Tom .
I don &apos;t even know how to dance .
That was totally my fault .
You don &apos;t have to answer this question .
Tom may die .
I thought as much .
It &apos;s very difficult .
What &apos;s the name of the man who was talking to you ?
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ll be back .
We &apos;re not rich .
This story is true .
When does Tom want to do that ?
I &apos;ll return at 6 : 30 .
I didn &apos;t understand what you said .
That &apos;s old news .
I consider Tom handsome .
Tom has gone to bed .
The garden is in front of the house .
I don &apos;t want to be rich .
Mary bought a present for her friend &apos;s daughter .
Tom said he &apos;d come .
He is often late for school .
It may be all right .
I don &apos;t worry about mistakes .
Maybe we already have enough money to buy a house .
Everyone except Tom and Mary left .
Tom said that he &apos;d be able to help us do that tomorrow afternoon .
Tom knows how to speak to children .
I could ask Tom to help me do my homework .
That &apos;s your decision .
If something happens , it &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault , not mine .
Tom had a hard time finding work .
Tom is going to be a father soon .
Tom went there to meet Mary .
Tom and I don &apos;t want that .
Tom gave me his phone number and told me to call him .
Tom did really well .
I answered the door .
Tom is no longer studying French .
Tom has big eyes .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any better .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know how to drive .
Might is right .
We &apos;re just trying to help you .
I want you to like Tom .
He sat next to the stream .
Everyone likes Tom .
Tom lost .
I don &apos;t remember seeing it before .
Tom will pay for everything .
Give that to me .
He is playing here .
He &apos;s on his last legs .
How about some coffee ?
Take whatever you like .
I wonder what has made him change his mind .
Tom was my teacher .
That &apos;s not what Tom is asking .
I don &apos;t have anything .
I know Tom wants us to help him .
A man must work .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here today .
I don &apos;t have a sister .
We know you &apos;re still there .
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
I have nothing to do this afternoon .
Come quickly !
Tom knows what you said .
A cat has seven lives .
I like to study English .
I think Tom loves Mary .
My cat and dog get along .
It is clear what must be done .
So , how long have you known Tom ?
Tom , are you there ?
I don &apos;t want dinner .
What have we got here ?
Tell us the truth , Tom .
I really wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
How far is it to the library from here ?
Let me go !
I just want to hold her hand .
Do you want to leave it like that ?
If I were rich , I &apos;d go abroad .
Tom fell into the river .
My door was closed .
My father has bought a new car .
This is good for us .
Tom is on the plane .
Your French has improved a lot .
It &apos;s not clear when he came here .
I &apos;ll be back soon .
I think Tom said that .
Tom is asleep .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
I don &apos;t like his way of talking .
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
I don &apos;t like your coming late every day .
This isn &apos;t my key .
How long is he going to stay in Japan ?
He was late for school yesterday .
Hop in .
Tom was really good .
I &apos;m too old for this sort of thing .
He is fond of this kind of music .
I lost my key .
Tom got dressed .
She did her best to help him .
I realized I couldn &apos;t win .
I think Tom should stay .
That &apos;s for Tom .
I hope everything &apos;s going well with you .
What time is the meeting ?
Do you think Tom is afraid ?
You didn &apos;t help Tom do that , did you ?
I &apos;m very busy these days .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want coffee ?
Tom sees this in a different way .
Tom kept pacing .
The old man walked across the road carefully .
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t feeling very well .
What makes people do that ?
I know that Tom can do that if he tries .
Do you think you &apos;d like to live in Boston ?
Tom was quiet all day .
He likes music a lot .
That doesn &apos;t mean that I &apos;ll stop doing it .
I always listen to anything Tom has to say .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
I &apos;m very happy with it .
Tom asked Mary about her job in Boston .
I fear nothing .
Nobody &apos;s there .
I think Tom is up to something .
Tom was absent from school yesterday .
I &apos;ll be able to finish in a day or two .
It is no use trying again .
Do you know who those people are ?
I don &apos;t know how Tom does it .
We are too drunk .
Will you help me for a minute ?
How do I get over the river ?
I &apos;m now your boss .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming .
Tom came home drunk last night .
We &apos;ve got plenty of time .
I &apos;ve decided that I won &apos;t go to Boston tomorrow .
It takes three hours to get to Boston from here .
Tom is eating dinner now .
I like being alone .
We have no idea what to do .
Tom isn &apos;t himself today .
I think my suitcase was stolen .
I think Tom might finally have a good idea .
Supper is getting cold .
We &apos;ll dance .
Did Tom get a chance ?
How many hours a day does Tom watch TV ?
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
He showed me the way to the station .
She knows . She always knows .
Is that possible ?
Please tell me where we &apos;re going .
Let &apos;s end this fast .
I just want a little more coffee .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
He doesn &apos;t care a bit about me .
Tom said Mary was too busy to help us .
I &apos;ll go and see Tom .
Tom knows why Mary did that .
Tom wondered where Mary went to school .
It seems that she was ill .
I know how we can help .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
You want me to go , don &apos;t you ?
Tom may sing .
Nobody came to the party .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something .
Tom is my brother .
I &apos;ll be ready in a jiffy .
It &apos;s something Tom made .
We have to get at the truth of the matter .
Is your father in the garden ?
I want to say I &apos;m sorry .
Do you really not remember me ?
All of us are happy .
I &apos;m doing this for Tom .
Nobody lives in this house anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to help him .
The girls were not afraid , but the boys were .
Tom is my name .
It was too difficult for me .
I must open the window .
Do you want to get married ?
There &apos;s been a lot of rain this summer .
Is there a desk by the window ?
We want to talk with Tom .
I want to go to America .
What &apos;s your asking price ?
What are you doing today ?
Tom wants our help .
I haven &apos;t tried .
I have to go alone .
You know what Tom said about Mary , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t want to die now .
When did you get this ?
He took her by the hand .
The question is where to buy the book .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary knows why John doesn &apos;t like her .
There are many people that don &apos;t like me .
I put on my shoes .
This suitcase is too heavy for you .
What are they going to do to me ?
I don &apos;t want to be the one to do that .
Let me show you how to do that .
I thought I heard you .
She went to the hospital by taxi .
What do you want to tell us ?
Let me do this .
I knew it would happen .
Tom isn &apos;t your name , is it ?
It is raining .
I don &apos;t think Tom would want to go to Boston with you .
We &apos;re not going .
I know Tom very well .
Tom is like a father to me .
Add a little more milk to my tea , please .
I don &apos;t think she would understand it .
A lot can happen in three hours .
I think I missed something .
It isn &apos;t expensive .
There is no film in this camera .
You don &apos;t look very good .
What are you going to give Tom ?
Are you planning to stay ?
I &apos;d like you to go there .
What you say is right .
Tom and Mary are no longer a couple .
Give me back my book . I need it again .
Tom fell into the river .
Tom loves the new house .
This meat is good .
I bought her a clock .
She heard him sing .
Since it &apos;s important , I &apos;ll do it .
Tom thinks I &apos;m crazy .
Please tell Tom that Mary called .
I do not fear death .
I don &apos;t even know who has stolen what .
We left together .
That was the first time I was ever alone with Tom .
I don &apos;t want to come back here ever again .
I &apos;ve got a few questions .
This doesn &apos;t happen every day .
You &apos;ll have to come tomorrow .
I &apos;m opposed to any type of war .
That &apos;s too long .
Your plan seems better than mine .
I love him more than anything .
It &apos;s started already .
Tom thought it was stupid .
Where &apos;s your money ?
I wish I hadn &apos;t done that .
I came here to tell you something .
I had my personal computer repaired .
We don &apos;t know what to do .
Tom never saw his father again .
He has been in Japan for two years .
I used to play tennis when I was a student .
Listen a minute .
I &apos;m not from Boston .
Are you good at it ?
Here they come .
Tom says he has nothing to do with the matter .
Tom and Mary are here , too .
I didn &apos;t even know you had a girlfriend .
I still think Tom will win .
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
Tom introduced Mary to his family .
Tom just listened .
I went to sleep .
Tom was nervous .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
The girl had no one to turn to for advice .
I don &apos;t have the time to read this book .
Why don &apos;t we shake on it ?
I &apos;m OK .
I don &apos;t think you believe that .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
I think we had better wait for another 30 minutes .
I wish you had told me about the accident .
What is wrong with her ?
I &apos;ll call for you at eight tomorrow morning .
Why do you have that ?
Tom is dating my sister .
Tom goes to school .
Tom might not be in Australia anymore .
&quot; What did you tell Tom ? &quot; &quot; I told him the truth . &quot;
Tom has a secret .
Whoever did it didn &apos;t want us to find out about it .
Tom never tells me anything .
I knew this would happen .
I will go on foot .
Tom was finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
It is a great pleasure being with you .
Maybe we should try again .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
I heard her singing .
Could you help me ?
What don &apos;t we know ?
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
You should &apos;ve let us know you were coming .
Tom wanted his money back .
He knows neither of us .
You &apos;re very quiet today .
Have you ever seen him swimming ?
I didn &apos;t like that any more than you did .
Give me back my book . I need it again .
Don &apos;t you like your job anymore ?
They missed a lot .
He is now almost as tall as his father is .
Tom will do that , I &apos;m pretty sure .
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago .
The girl has no mother .
I have trouble talking about my feelings .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d like a cup of coffee .
I &apos;ll assist Tom .
Why didn &apos;t Tom visit Boston ?
There is something fishy here .
Why &apos;s Tom staying in Boston ?
I want Tom to come with us .
Can I go to the movies tomorrow ?
Tom helped .
That isn &apos;t likely to be a problem .
That &apos;s a very good car .
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary .
I know you &apos;re happy about that .
Tom brought his dog over to Mary &apos;s house .
What should I tell Tom now ?
Tom told me not to drive too fast .
She can &apos;t stop talking .
Tom is much better at French than me .
Did you already do your homework ?
We don &apos;t know where Tom is , but we need to find him as soon as we can .
Can I come to your office tomorrow ?
Tom was wearing glasses .
I &apos;m in Boston .
So what is everyone &apos;s problem ?
I need to be on my own for a while .
I have read the book before .
They don &apos;t want you . They want Tom .
He has no hat on .
What is it you want me to do ?
Tom is going to help us .
Have fun .
Tom is getting married next month .
Tom looks very good .
She went to the movies by herself .
Tom was born on a ship .
She doesn &apos;t always come late .
I like it here .
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s boss , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom will be furious .
I said I didn &apos;t remember .
The door would not open .
I &apos;ll call you every night .
He was happily married .
Tom and I are almost the same height .
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday .
It would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had been here .
That was a mistake .
Come to me .
Everything &apos;s better .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
Tom makes his own bed every morning .
Tom didn &apos;t get very far .
I found Tom there .
I &apos;ll always remember you .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
What is it that you want to know ?
My kids have all left school .
How long will you be staying here ?
No one has come .
They &apos;re Tom and Mary .
I was surprised to see you here .
Watch what you &apos;re doing !
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
Tom waited more than an hour .
We want to take it .
Where are you from , Tom ?
I don &apos;t know where Tom and Mary met .
I don &apos;t want to talk about my child .
Maybe she forgot my birthday .
Tom is going to love living here .
We &apos;re students .
There has to be another way to do this .
Tom does everything very quickly .
How many children do you have ?
Tom sat alone on the couch .
Is this your dog ?
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell you anything .
Why is he doing this ?
Come whenever you want to .
You could do better .
You can &apos;t always do what you want .
I don &apos;t need it .
What was it you wanted to ask me to do ?
You can sit down if you like .
He just arrived .
I was with Tom last night .
Have you thought of that ?
She stayed at a hotel .
Tom is putting the children to sleep .
This table is the same as that one .
The boy takes after his father .
I love that book .
I &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
I want that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
Tom was just about to leave .
I don &apos;t see Tom a whole lot .
You should &apos;ve told me a few days ago .
Tom has never actually done that .
He doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
Tom is just nervous , that &apos;s all .
I sat next to Tom .
I have finished .
He looks very tired .
Why do you like Boston ?
Tom asked Mary to leave .
I always wanted to do that .
I thought Tom wanted to marry you .
I first met him three years ago .
I saw Tom less than an hour ago .
I wanted to hurt Tom .
I &apos;m not saying why .
That can &apos;t be .
I &apos;ve got to show you something .
Tom &apos;s gone .
Tom gave Mary a lift home .
We know you &apos;re still there .
He seems to be rich .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
Tom and Mary were the last two to leave .
Can they see me ?
Tom said he was afraid .
I noticed some mistakes in his report .
Why are you doing this to Tom ?
I &apos;m almost done .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
That &apos;s what I told him .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John in a long time .
I love my family .
Do you want to use mine ?
Tom won &apos;t eat that .
I &apos;ll take care of you .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
I don &apos;t like Tom and I never will .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for anything .
Can you please help me ?
Tom was quick .
Tom wouldn &apos;t speak to Mary .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
It &apos;s simply too cold today .
I got up at six .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom hadn &apos;t done that ?
Tom plays tennis every day .
Tom is a personal friend .
Tom died in October last year .
Tom had lunch with Mary .
Don &apos;t you want to study ?
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s brother .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s father .
I &apos;d like for you to go .
I saw my uncle on the way to school .
Do you know the reason why she is so angry ?
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here today .
I hate this music .
Can she come , too ?
I don &apos;t do this for the money .
The structure isn &apos;t safe .
Tom will carry those suitcases for you .
This must never happen again .
Tom is going to get one .
I have to go back to Boston .
Why don &apos;t you have a look ?
Tom barely spoke .
When are you coming back to the office ?
Tom seemed hungry .
I don &apos;t like dogs .
I thought you might want a drink .
It &apos;s too hard .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the right to say that .
Do you want me to go to Boston with you ?
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
I didn &apos;t think anyone still lived in this house .
Anyone can make a mistake .
Tom wants that .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
No one knew about it .
I opened the door .
Your shoes are here .
Are you still hungry ?
There is no choice in this matter .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy here .
Tom asked Mary for her telephone number .
My hotel told me to call you .
I like Tom &apos;s voice .
Tom would tell us the truth , wouldn &apos;t he ?
You &apos;re making me hungry .
There were no more apples in the box .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
I missed the last bus and had to walk home in the rain .
Tom did everything he could .
How can I forget it ?
Please give me a glass of water .
My father must do the work .
I only hope that is enough .
Can Tom pay for all this ?
Tom has what Mary wants .
You should come .
I saw a dog swim across the river .
Who gave this to you ?
I can &apos;t believe I did that .
We &apos;ve done all that we could .
You should look after the children from time to time .
Tom likes to go to Boston .
When and where did you buy that old clock ?
I &apos;m sorry I cannot go with you .
That is a table .
Maybe you didn &apos;t understand Tom .
We haven &apos;t seen each other for such a long time .
Where are we getting the money ?
I think it works .
Tom didn &apos;t actually do that .
I know you are rich .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
He is very fond of music .
This house is large enough for your family to live in .
She listens to him .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to live like this anymore .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
Tom looks tired this evening .
I can &apos;t talk .
Don &apos;t you want Tom there ?
I &apos;ve met you before .
We &apos;ll have to do this later .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Mary .
Tom is occupied .
His eyesight is bad .
Are you sure that this isn &apos;t true ?
Why do I have to do this alone ?
It doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
Why is it so hot ?
No one speaks with me .
Tom died when I was very young .
I think I &apos;ll go home .
I think you &apos;re being a little too careful .
I have to deal with this alone .
That &apos;s not exactly true .
I will be the cook tonight .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
We &apos;ll never have to do this again .
No one saw Tom do that .
We &apos;ll walk .
Tom asked Mary a few questions that she couldn &apos;t answer , but she was able to answer most of his questions .
What kind of person does something like that ?
The girl always looked happy , but she wasn &apos;t at all happy .
It &apos;s Monday today .
Tom and Mary were looking at each other .
I want you to have it .
Where should we stay in Boston ?
I prefer cats to dogs .
Let &apos;s get this over with quickly .
I like having plenty to do .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
Tom says he has to study French .
I remember everything you tell me .
I want a television set , but I can &apos;t afford to buy one .
Where is your room ?
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
I don &apos;t like people like Tom .
Have you eaten your dinner already ?
It &apos;s your book .
It &apos;s not hard to find .
I was in Boston yesterday .
I do hope you &apos;ll come again .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll rain this afternoon .
Tom is very glad that school is over .
It was seven thirty .
What did you have for breakfast ?
He used to say so , but now he doesn &apos;t .
I was just going to do that .
I wasn &apos;t looking for anything .
You can &apos;t drink the water here .
She must have done it yesterday .
It hasn &apos;t been that long .
Could you do that ?
I like this tea .
This book seemed interesting .
Tom beat Mary up .
We ended up going home early .
No one is listening to you .
I knew Tom was busy .
Why don &apos;t you go and have a look ?
He is in trouble .
That &apos;s not how .
My wife isn &apos;t beautiful . Yours is .
I can hardly remember Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know why .
I think Tom is OK .
You should pay for it .
Why don &apos;t we head back ?
There were no knives .
He wrote the report .
I think Tom was drunk .
I mean it !
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom .
Is that such a bad thing ?
Tom is sick , but it isn &apos;t serious .
Tom almost died in that accident .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his lunch yet .
Is this for me ?
Tom is putting on weight .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
You &apos;ll be asleep by the time your father gets home .
This has never been tried before .
What do you think of war ?
Did you hear about what happened last night ?
You have to stop drinking .
What have you been up to lately ?
I can wait for you .
Tom speaks French as well as you .
What did you do ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have said such a thing .
I remember seeing the movie before .
It wasn &apos;t my wife on the phone .
You have to come with me .
You should wait for Tom .
His family is very large .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a wife .
Mary is tall .
Tom looks like John .
This one is for us .
I think Tom could learn a lot from you .
I have money enough to buy it .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me who to give this to .
I was right behind Tom .
Is Tom happy about this ?
The reply came after three days .
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
The work must be done by Tom .
Doing that would make me happy .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary can .
I thought you were my best friend .
Tom &apos;s very , very good .
How did you guys meet ?
I am talking with Tom .
We have everything .
We never expected it .
You can rely on him .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he is .
I want to tell you the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I know .
What do you think she is doing now ?
He sees nothing wrong with it .
He is studying in the library now .
In Australia , they speak English .
Am I allowed to use this ?
Tom tried to answer the question .
You should have worked harder .
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .
I &apos;ve lost my bag .
He didn &apos;t see a thing .
I &apos;ll come .
I know you are rich .
You may be correct .
When will you be back ?
I think Tom is thirty .
Why am I here ?
Don &apos;t be like Tom .
Let &apos;s get a cab .
Why were you looking for Tom ?
I wouldn &apos;t have made it without you .
Tom rides a bicycle .
How did Tom know that Mary wouldn &apos;t be here ?
That bicycle is too small for you .
They love me .
You really need a woman .
These dogs are big .
I need to know that Tom is still alive .
There &apos;s something under the bed .
Tom wasn &apos;t quiet .
I didn &apos;t see anyone in the room but Tom .
I will never tell !
Do you know where the money is ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French .
Tom brought me a glass of water .
That looks like tea .
I don &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
Many of my friends can speak French .
I wonder what Tom means by that .
We have time enough to eat .
Every day he says something different .
I &apos;ll live .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
I should &apos;ve known this .
How did you find out that Tom didn &apos;t need to do that ?
You must tell us .
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t home .
Tom speaks good French .
What are all these kids doing here ?
I didn &apos;t want to die .
What &apos;re they going to do to Tom and Mary ?
Tom won &apos;t talk .
You had better stop smoking .
Did Tom really do that ?
You can say whatever you want .
We aren &apos;t in any danger , are we ?
I can &apos;t go to lunch with you today .
Tom lives in a big house all by himself .
You &apos;d better take this .
Do you want to know his name ?
You know what I want .
When did you go there ?
Tom and I often eat lunch together .
I guess they really weren &apos;t busy .
My dad &apos;s not here .
Why is it there ?
Tom was walking .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was ill .
Where does he come from ?
She just told me .
Tom has a friend in Boston .
She was making tea .
You may take my word for it .
It &apos;s far too dangerous .
Tom &apos;s drunk .
You worked hard .
What are you doing Sunday ?
We can talk about that later .
Give me another cup of tea .
When was the last time you went to Boston ?
You must come with me .
Tom is definitely over thirty .
I rode my bicycle to the store .
Who saw you ?
Tom and Mary are sick .
This is still not good enough .
I don &apos;t feel like taking a walk now .
Tom and Mary won &apos;t play tennis together this week .
Tom usually walks home from work .
I have a lot of things to tell you .
He thinks he knows everything .
It was very simple .
Don &apos;t you want to know what it means ?
I &apos;m proud of my father .
I am married and have two children .
I like them both .
Do it the way he tells you to .
When exactly did you get here ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to like this .
My wife and kids were there .
Tom really does do that sometimes .
I &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
You &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t you ?
He is short , but strong .
No one understands you like I do .
Can you cook a meal ?
Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
This is how I learned English .
I never thought I &apos;d find Tom .
My father can swim , but my mother can &apos;t .
Tom is good at this .
This is his car , I think .
Tom came over yesterday with one of his friends .
I &apos;m coming with Tom .
Tom is going to like me .
You never actually did that , did you ?
Tom is headed for Boston .
You must help her .
Tom didn &apos;t like the new plan .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know what to do .
Where did Tom work ?
He made me happy yesterday .
Tom knows exactly what he needs to do .
I would like you to meet a friend of mine .
All the girls are crazy about Tom .
You missed the meeting .
He can &apos;t sing .
I only wish Tom had tried .
Tom is sleeping now .
We have lunch at midday .
I can &apos;t understand that word .
Can we do that before Monday ?
Just say whatever you want to say .
Tom is going out with Mary .
You &apos;re students , aren &apos;t you ?
Who told you the story ?
He was too young to go to school .
Why did Tom want you here ?
You should pay for it .
You deserve to know the truth .
He looked young .
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me .
Tom isn &apos;t going to change .
I like it , too .
The weather is very bad .
You &apos;re three years older than me .
What do you think he meant by that ?
I don &apos;t want to become like those people .
I am fine .
Thank you for being here .
You made a mistake .
Tom knows he &apos;s right .
Tom lives in Boston with his mother .
He had no hat on .
Tom must &apos;ve been very disappointed .
Tom is lying in bed .
They &apos;re all dead .
We &apos;re just friends .
Tom wants to change .
I &apos;m no longer married .
Here &apos;s your key .
I &apos;d like a glass of water .
May I have this book ?
I know nothing about him beyond what you told me .
Tom hasn &apos;t bought a new pair of shoes in three years .
I have a present for you .
They &apos;ll want Tom .
I thought so .
What I &apos;m telling you is true .
We have a lot of time .
Everyone does what he wants .
You should prepare for the future .
Anybody can do that .
We had next to nothing in the kitchen .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat after all .
I would do that right now if I were you .
Do your parents know that you &apos;re here ?
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
I hope we &apos;ll never have to do that again .
I &apos;m not really hungry .
He has made up his mind to buy the car .
We should &apos;ve helped Tom more .
That &apos;s how I know .
Is this our hotel ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to do that .
How could Tom know that ?
Is he right ?
Tom is already in Boston .
Tom and I see each other every day .
What &apos;s Tom going to think ?
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen .
Tom really needs your help .
It &apos;s a new movie theater .
That &apos;s too good a story to be true .
I think the future looks good .
Tom isn &apos;t like us .
He has always understood our problems right away .
I have one question .
I &apos;m happy to see you here .
How about a song ?
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
I can &apos;t leave until I &apos;ve found out how Tom is .
I always keep promises .
Tom was late again this morning .
He does this all the time .
I will have him repair this watch .
Why don &apos;t you come over to my place sometime ?
Tom has many friends here .
Tom says this is what he really needs .
What about your wife ?
I can &apos;t stand him .
How was your night ?
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom to do that ?
You look tired .
You must do as you are told .
Food is too expensive .
I know you &apos;ve got a secret .
Tom says that he loves Mary .
They don &apos;t teach you that in school .
He followed in his father &apos;s footsteps .
Can I talk to you ?
What is the cat up to ?
Stop playing with that thing .
Our money is gone .
Why do we have to go home ?
It &apos;s correct .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
It &apos;s too large .
I don &apos;t have anything to do now .
I couldn &apos;t get it .
I thought you were into it .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
Have you seen Tom &apos;s new apartment ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom knew how to do that .
They &apos;re looking for it .
I just need to know you &apos;re OK .
She doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
Tom is practically dead .
I &apos;m glad I don &apos;t have to do that anymore .
You &apos;re stalling .
I know what I think .
Do you have the book ?
Tom is listening to music .
I want you to read this book .
We &apos;re a family .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
It &apos;s been raining since morning .
Tom remained standing .
I know you can do it .
We know you &apos;re still there .
Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Don &apos;t be so sure .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
What can I do for you ?
Where was Tom last weekend ?
Don &apos;t you want to come with us ?
Did you see Tom leave ?
Tom will let you do that .
Where did I put my glasses ?
My taxi should be here soon .
I wish I could be in Boston now .
I &apos;ll take your suitcase to your room .
Did you figure this out on your own ?
I don &apos;t know why we came here .
I simply don &apos;t understand this .
Tom has a sister who likes to play tennis .
Why did you start learning French ?
Did you like the movie ?
No one will believe you .
I am only too glad to help you with your work .
We plan to go as far as we can .
My brother speaks very quickly .
Did you find Tom or not ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
That &apos;s one of my dogs .
What did Tom just say to you ?
Tom just died .
You should call your mother as soon as possible .
Where are my parents ?
She will have her own way .
Tom can &apos;t swim very well .
Can you see anything out there ?
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself .
What are you two up to ?
Tom stood alone .
Tom has a sister in Boston .
Tom and I aren &apos;t coming .
How does this camera work ?
How old are you ?
My opinion doesn &apos;t really matter .
He likes it when I do that .
The decision has been made .
I thought a lot about what Tom said .
I often wonder if I will ever get married .
Tom died in prison .
I &apos;ll be back at half past six .
He was kind enough to show me the way to the station .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
Just be yourself .
You &apos;re nuts !
I was trying to find Tom .
I &apos;ve been on the phone all afternoon .
I &apos;m very happy with my new car .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
Let &apos;s get this over with as fast as we can .
She needs someone who is able to understand her .
It &apos;s time for lunch .
Tom sat reading .
Why is it that you are always late ?
I never want to see him again .
Tom introduced Mary to me .
We &apos;re on your side .
It matters .
Tom needs new shoes .
Tom is like his father .
Tom appears to be enjoying the party .
Is Tom alone ?
Is your mother at home ?
We need Tom .
I hired Tom .
Tom won &apos;t likely be able to cope with the situation .
He works for a bank .
Thank you for that .
You can &apos;t pretend this didn &apos;t happen .
He is something like his father .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;m not stopping you .
I almost forgot that it was his birthday .
Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle .
Why are you on this ship ?
You have no idea how important you are to me .
I think about that from time to time .
Tom is coming today .
Can I have a moment ?
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
Tom seems busy .
You &apos;d better not go there .
Why does Tom do that to himself ?
I didn &apos;t mean to frighten you .
No one had an answer .
I spend money as soon as I get it .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
Why don &apos;t we go out ?
I have the house all to myself .
It &apos;s always been like that .
I said don &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
When did you ask Tom ?
Excuse me , but I think this is my seat .
I speak French a little .
There &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
It &apos;s clear that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;m not going .
It may be important .
Why didn &apos;t someone help Tom ?
Tom lost his son in the war .
I must learn French .
I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
It was cold outside .
Most people don &apos;t drink enough water .
We didn &apos;t get far .
Leave everything .
Tom helped Mary put her coat on .
How long ago was it ?
Tom probably didn &apos;t even know about the meeting .
Tom is not yet able to swim .
I saw the doctor .
I like girls .
I need to talk with you about Tom .
I &apos;ve got more money than Tom has .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
Did you understand what he meant ?
I can &apos;t play the piano .
Is that your mom ?
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
He left ten minutes ago .
Tom &apos;s mother told him a story .
Why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
They don &apos;t want us .
I would buy him a beer .
You can stay as long as you like .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
You stole the money , didn &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s just not true .
My uncle died a year ago .
I like to be around people .
In the war , many people died young .
I feel like I &apos;ve already seen this movie .
You &apos;re not even safe in your own home .
She might be taller than you .
Tom got his watch fixed .
I &apos;d like to hear what your opinion is .
She looked at him and knew that he was angry .
I don &apos;t have a choice . I have to do it .
The park was full of people .
I gave the boy a book .
Tom appears convinced .
You &apos;re not eating very much . What &apos;s wrong ?
Keep it simple , Tom .
I feel really good now .
I don &apos;t like this one .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
I can &apos;t swim now as well as I used to be able to .
What kind of person are you ?
Would you like to have another cup of tea ?
Tom is getting rich .
Who &apos;s that ?
I &apos;ll take my car .
I will be at home tomorrow .
Tom told Mary he had a lot of money .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Is that not enough ?
Why does Tom know that ?
We &apos;re just pretending .
Do you know where they are ?
What does this mean for Tom ?
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
I want to forget her .
How long have you worked in Boston ?
Tom continued to speak .
When is Tom going to do that ?
Ask yourself why .
They married when they were young .
I know you can do this .
You have to go home .
I &apos;m sure everything will be OK now .
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to see him to the door .
We must be cautious .
I can &apos;t imagine a world without you .
I prefer fish to meat .
Tom &apos;s my friend .
Can you open the window ?
Do you want me to do that for you ?
I would like to eat something .
I can &apos;t remember why I did that .
Are you from the bank ?
I think that I &apos;m doing something wrong .
We &apos;re very disappointed in you .
That &apos;s how life is .
Can you explain that ?
Have you finished your work ?
Here it is .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t need my help .
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
I have already done my homework .
There are more girls than boys in our school .
What do I get out of it ?
Where are you from ?
Have you eaten dinner yet ?
The train was more crowded than usual .
I &apos;d be happy here , I think .
Tom is thirty now .
This doesn &apos;t concern you .
She didn &apos;t have much difficulty finding out the answer to the problem .
Tom turned the TV off .
Tom waited for three hours .
I think that she knows the truth .
I don &apos;t know who it is .
I must leave now .
It wasn &apos;t mine .
How do you know all this ?
Tom wanted to have another baby , but his wife didn &apos;t .
I was serious .
This is something Tom made for you .
I think that this is the way to do it .
Why were you in Boston ?
I like tea .
Make me happy .
Tom helped a lot .
I don &apos;t think your mother will like it .
Do you have many friends here in Japan ?
Tom is seldom late for school .
Tom wants advice .
Everyone says that he &apos;s a good man .
The good news is that we &apos;ll be able to help you .
She asked him to stay , but he had to go to work .
I have many things to do .
Tom says I make him nervous .
We don &apos;t have time for this .
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French ?
I &apos;ll see you a week from today .
Are you sure Tom is here ?
This is going to be fun .
We &apos;re like a big family here .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t remember seeing Mary at the party .
Perhaps he could solve this problem .
Tom wished Mary was with him .
I thought it was really good .
I know Tom is in love with Mary .
I think we need more water .
Don &apos;t let me die here .
I know a lot about you .
Tom didn &apos;t go home yesterday .
I &apos;m taking the day off .
Tom waited more than an hour .
What are you doing this evening ?
We &apos;ve already decided not to do that .
Listen to your mother .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go .
It doesn &apos;t look good .
The dog seems to be sick .
I want more money .
Are you the only one who has a key to this door ?
At what time will you be leaving ?
Is this seat vacant ?
I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
She is not my sister , she &apos;s my wife .
People like Tom because he &apos;s friendly .
I don &apos;t believe this is true .
How long have you been in Boston ?
Tom is too old to be living on his own .
Are you taller than Tom ?
Tom knows I &apos;m home .
You &apos;ll never be alone .
We became very good friends .
I feel like I &apos;m thirty years old .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
We know who you are .
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
Who told Tom that ?
I get paid to do that .
Tom shouldn &apos;t talk so much .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
Don &apos;t leave the water running .
Tom went alone .
I missed the last bus .
This book is too difficult for me to read .
Tom said he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak .
A car drove past .
It &apos;s important for us to think about the future of the world .
You didn &apos;t try hard enough .
What kind of English is that ?
You don &apos;t know my brother .
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was that old .
He said that I shouldn &apos;t even be coming in today .
What makes you think I &apos;ll like it ?
He got on the train .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough time to get everything done .
Somebody &apos;s got to talk to Tom .
She handed him the money .
He has been driving for hours .
Please be careful .
I think you should do it .
You have one hour to get this done .
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
I really don &apos;t know him .
I beg you to help me .
You &apos;re among friends .
Can I use this ?
That &apos;s a good picture .
Tom didn &apos;t even know that Mary was gone .
I know why Tom wants to do that .
We &apos;re good at it .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s even possible .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard that word in a long time .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t eat meat .
That was a big mistake .
I could scarcely believe it .
You can tell Tom yourself .
Regardless what he does , he does it well .
Tom &apos;s dog is very big .
May I ask why ?
I got married yesterday .
I don &apos;t think Tom took us seriously .
I learned to read in school .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
You can eat lunch here in this room .
How did Tom find you ?
I will look after the dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much money .
We &apos;re dating .
He &apos;s your father .
I think Tom injured himself .
Do you think that &apos;s what I want ?
Tom is going to be very hurt .
I know it was you .
That girl looks like Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t have as much trouble finding a job as he thought he would .
I &apos;ve lost it .
I can &apos;t find the newspaper .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I want to ask you some questions about Tom .
There are people here who need your help .
You like him , don &apos;t you ?
I think I &apos;m going to like this .
Tom and Mary want to go home .
I arrived in London .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
No one &apos;s coming to our party tonight .
How long have you been in Boston ?
You can &apos;t give Tom that .
I think his life is in danger .
Tom is the same age as I am .
That won &apos;t work !
I want to go to school .
I was surprised Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
Here comes the bus !
I met Tom .
I was just talking about you .
Tom likes it there .
I come here every day .
We &apos;ll ask Tom .
My sister is very fond of children .
I want to be there .
Would you like to know who did that ?
I ate with my baby brother .
I &apos;m not going back .
Tom always speaks French .
Have you called him yet ?
Tom put some milk in his coffee .
I appreciate your telling me .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
You won &apos;t be needing that again .
Where &apos;s my grandfather ?
She baked me a cake .
Tom is going on vacation tomorrow .
&quot; Who is in the car ? &quot; &quot; Tom is . &quot;
He went to London two years ago .
People don &apos;t do that .
That &apos;s news to me .
We all need love .
Tom needs the money .
I have to stay in bed all day .
We can do it ourselves .
I think what Tom said is incorrect .
I &apos;m on my way .
All I can do at the moment is wait .
I hear that he &apos;s very rich .
You &apos;ve got to stay awake .
Tom has a lot of friends now .
It was yesterday that I met her .
I &apos;m sure that wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s dog .
The bus leaves every ten minutes .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as Mary .
I had to do everything alone .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait for Tom ?
Each one does what he wishes .
Tom is lying on the ground .
You might try asking Tom .
I &apos;m kind of happy .
There &apos;s someone at the door .
Is Tom in on this ?
It looks like Tom really enjoys doing that .
Do you know something about this ?
What does everybody else think ?
That &apos;s what we do .
I was devastated .
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else .
We don &apos;t have enough food .
Tom is doing what he loves .
I saw Tom at the library .
I understand how good Tom is .
Tom has already done it .
Tom got really upset .
Tom was lucky that he didn &apos;t get killed .
I don &apos;t understand what you mean .
Tom used the key Mary had given him to open the door .
I &apos;m going to write Tom a letter .
I haven &apos;t eaten lunch yet .
I &apos;d better be going .
They were ready .
Tom has a pretty good idea why Mary isn &apos;t here now .
I can &apos;t imagine life without him .
I told Tom that his French was easy to understand .
Tom has been trying to get in touch with you .
We learn to read and write in school .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten a thing all day .
That &apos;s for sure .
Who is your dad ?
My mother made me what I am today .
Tom brought his son to work .
We need them .
I hate this .
You have to believe me .
Tom wants this one .
That &apos;s what I say .
How could Tom be so stupid ?
Have your parents met your girlfriend yet ?
Tom punched me in the face .
Tom is on his way here .
Tom can &apos;t work tonight .
They say that he &apos;s still alive .
Tom had a good teacher .
Where is the train station ?
Tom was lucky .
Tom is different .
We &apos;ll make it .
We don &apos;t want your money .
How did you do it without our help ?
Tom wanted to meet Mary .
Tom is already really good .
Tom really needs to tell Mary the truth .
Here &apos;s a picture of me .
I want to be a teacher .
What &apos;s with everybody ?
How &apos;s it coming , Tom ?
Can you do this ?
Have you seen enough ?
Where did you buy your car ?
Tom has to tell the truth .
I was married here .
You can go if you want to .
I think you went too far .
Where &apos;s the teacher ?
You &apos;re in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom was slow .
Can you hear it ?
He removed his shirt .
I hope we don &apos;t have to wait for too long .
Do you know how to fix this ?
I need to find a new job .
Tom has got a plan .
Tom and Mary both need new shoes .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
It is not far away from the hotel .
Tom often goes to Boston .
I &apos;m awake .
I have a few things to finish up before I go home .
I also like to listen to music .
I didn &apos;t say you took it .
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
He didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
We &apos;ll be seeing you .
I agreed with Tom .
I didn &apos;t care if anybody saw me .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything to eat ?
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
I told Tom not to come .
Tom can &apos;t win .
I wish that I could help you .
How did you learn that ?
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
The book fell to the floor .
He lives in a very small room .
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
I don &apos;t know how long it &apos;ll last .
Tom made Mary happy .
I thought that would be a great idea .
I wrote a letter to my mother .
I like the people here .
I need a little more time .
Tom likes to stay at home alone .
I have a good mind to study abroad .
What &apos;re they up to ?
Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
I &apos;ll show you the city .
I had him repair my watch .
I could not have done otherwise .
Mary doesn &apos;t look like her mother .
We &apos;re not friends anymore .
We &apos;re not listening .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
Being free , she went out for a walk .
Come help me .
I think it &apos;s OK .
Who &apos;s going to do this ?
I wouldn &apos;t count on it .
Tom loves you . I know he does .
Tom stayed in Boston for three years .
Things are fine .
I like the way you talk .
Do you know if Tom is here ?
I can &apos;t do it right now .
Did you give the children enough to eat ?
They don &apos;t know about it .
Tom bought too much milk .
Tom has my book .
I have money enough to buy it .
I can understand French better than I can speak it .
When did you buy this car ?
I must get it fixed .
Have you talked to Tom about this ?
I &apos;d rather go today than tomorrow .
I know that she is beautiful .
Tom knows what he &apos;s going to do .
I see your house .
She &apos;s about the same age as me .
He gave it a new name .
The man raised his hand to ask a question .
How long have you been studying French ?
Tom never had to worry about money .
I &apos;m not really that sorry .
Tom wears a hat almost every day .
I &apos;m proud to be your father .
She has been busy since yesterday .
Tom can &apos;t get enough of it .
We know what happened next .
My mother &apos;s going to kill me .
Please close the door behind you .
He says he met my father .
The sun is about to set .
Come and see me when you have time .
I finally found a place where we can be alone .
Who did you come with ?
This apple is bad .
What you say is right .
You &apos;re in my way .
I want to marry you .
Are you in danger ?
Let &apos;s see what will happen .
Nobody knows me in Boston .
I didn &apos;t intend to say that .
He had a dog .
The man died a few hours ago .
All is calm tonight .
I know what you &apos;re doing .
This window won &apos;t open .
I sincerely hope for his happiness .
He &apos;s working on it .
Tom seems kind .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
I came looking for you .
You were there for me when I needed you .
You should &apos;ve called .
The television isn &apos;t working .
Why is swimming not allowed in this river ?
He &apos;s like a brother to me .
I still have them .
I think he is planning something .
Are you OK , Tom ?
Tom can &apos;t see us .
May I open the window ?
Do you have time to help me ?
You should call your father as soon as possible .
I don &apos;t want to read this book .
He hasn &apos;t come yet .
How &apos;s your sister ?
You said it yourself .
You never asked me .
Tom and Mary will be going home soon .
Tom likes Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
He &apos;s going to make it .
I &apos;ll give you thirty dollars for that .
I got it for next to nothing .
You &apos;re still in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
What do you have to say ?
The door opened .
Tom always looked busy .
He seems to be sick .
Is that what it takes ?
Does that make you happy ?
Maybe I should go .
I &apos;m in trouble .
I did everything right .
Aren &apos;t you guys having any fun ?
Maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
Why do you want Tom to do that ?
I thought I told you not to come .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
Thank you for doing that .
Tom wants to tell you about Mary .
Mary believes in the power of love .
When will you return ?
Does everybody want it ?
The music is too loud .
Tom will be proven right .
Tom knew he was going to win .
My husband always reads in bed .
Tom isn &apos;t alone anymore .
There &apos;s a lot of money involved .
This game can be played by young children .
I &apos;m sick .
She gave them some apples .
It &apos;s not supposed to happen .
It was easy to answer .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ?
I don &apos;t want to hear this .
I &apos;m the only one who ever really liked Tom .
I think that he will succeed .
Tom didn &apos;t seem very busy .
Do you wish to see my passport ?
That &apos;s what we want , isn &apos;t it ?
They have no idea what our problems are .
Why do I need to speak French ?
That &apos;s what I like about you .
Tom actually did what he said he would do .
We can try harder .
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
We can &apos;t let Tom die .
Who are those women ?
I &apos;d like to know what your opinion is .
Tom introduced his daughter to me .
Who else knows about your secret ?
I &apos;ll buy you a beer .
Tom won &apos;t mind .
Did you enjoy the film ?
I only hope we &apos;re not too late .
Tom , your life &apos;s in danger .
I &apos;ve already finished my homework .
I won &apos;t buy that .
Aren &apos;t you going to eat anything ?
That &apos;s not my problem .
I want to change my life .
I can &apos;t stand it .
We &apos;re getting a new car next month .
You like French , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
Where are your parents ?
Stop it , Tom .
How was your summer ?
We have to stop it .
I am your father .
Tom isn &apos;t seeing Mary .
You know I love you .
It &apos;s very quiet here , isn &apos;t it ?
I may not make it .
At your age , you ought to know better .
Tom should be up .
She can drive a car .
I walk my dog in the park every morning .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
Tom may have won .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten yet .
Everybody needs food , don &apos;t they ?
Tom likes to do everything himself .
I &apos;ve just arrived at the airport .
A man &apos;s gotta do what a man &apos;s gotta do .
I &apos;ve got to find it .
Tell me again what Tom and I are supposed to do .
She &apos;s not my girlfriend . She &apos;s my sister .
This book is easy for me to read .
I can &apos;t believe what I &apos;m hearing .
I love her .
Tom stayed put .
He often plays guitar .
Tom is a total nutcase .
Were you expecting something different ?
Tom , I &apos;m with you on this .
I can &apos;t believe that .
You had your sister really worried .
I didn &apos;t mean to do it .
I like taking walks .
We only do what we &apos;ve been told .
My father always took me to school when I was young .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
Tom will go .
Do you have a big family ?
Women love that .
Tom gave Mary a lift to the station .
Go home .
I am very happy .
Tom will answer all of your questions .
You need to make a decision .
If I were rich , I would buy it .
It is a lot of fun to listen to music .
Tom should probably do that soon .
This book looks interesting .
You have to keep your promise .
I &apos;m sure I saw her two years ago .
Leave him alone .
How many people do you see ?
Tom waited .
What is Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name ?
Tom left about thirty minutes ago .
It won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m feeling much better now .
It &apos;ll be a good day .
I &apos;ll give you something .
Is that where Tom is ?
Did you see the accident with your own eyes ?
I &apos;m not supposed to talk to you .
I think it &apos;s impossible for Tom .
Do you want to dance with me ?
These shoes are way too small for me .
We want to live here .
Is it hot ?
Tom is a good student .
Money doesn &apos;t buy happiness .
I don &apos;t want anything to do with that .
She is living hand-to-mouth .
This house is mine .
Tom said he had a friend in Boston .
I need your answer by the end of the day .
I think this is good for us .
It matters to me .
We &apos;re about the same height .
That &apos;ll be seven dollars , please .
Let us out .
My mother was sick for two days .
Tom was not surprised by what he read in the report .
I need to wash my hands .
What did you have for lunch ?
Aren &apos;t you glad that Tom did that ?
I am sure of his coming to the party .
Tom just ate .
You should read as many books as you can .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
A cat was on the table .
I didn &apos;t say you took it .
I didn &apos;t actually hit Tom .
Are you here on holiday ?
Let me explain it to you .
Has Tom ever written a letter in French ?
I can &apos;t remember her name .
It being Sunday , the shop was closed .
Everyone should like that .
I don &apos;t care what Tom says . I &apos;m not going to go .
The door opened .
I know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
He asked us to help him .
How are you doing , Tom ?
We need to ask you a few questions , Tom .
They get along like a cat and a dog .
Tom likes tea better than coffee .
I don &apos;t feel like doing that now .
I don &apos;t know how to use this .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to work by himself .
Take only one .
You kids must be tired .
Tom is making money off us .
I wish I had been there with you .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
He works at a bank .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary went .
Tom says he feels a little better .
Do you want Tom to wait ?
Can this be it ?
I &apos;ll make Tom do it .
We &apos;ve done everything we could .
If I had enough money , I would buy the book .
This book is too difficult for you to read .
Tom says Mary needs more time to finish her report .
I &apos;m going again tomorrow .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
No one says that anymore .
Can I have a beer , please ?
That &apos;s not quite right .
When will you have the report ready ?
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
Have you found anything ?
How did you get into my house ?
It &apos;s time to sleep .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me what to do ?
I &apos;m much older than you think I am .
I haven &apos;t heard anything .
Are you still here ?
Who will come with me ?
She didn &apos;t go far .
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom &apos;s face .
I know nothing about her .
He has a camera .
They may be in danger .
Let him do as he likes .
You &apos;re going to be a good father .
Where did the other one go ?
Tom could do it if he tried .
I don &apos;t want to talk about school .
He doesn &apos;t have as many books as she does .
Tom and Mary have nothing in the world except each other .
What should they do in this situation ?
I can &apos;t believe you came here alone .
Tom said I shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
I have finished my work .
I can stay .
How often do you come to Boston ?
Are you content ?
I &apos;m sure that she &apos;s correct .
I could show you around the city .
I never wanted to do this .
Hold on a moment , please .
We &apos;re back .
I need to read a lot .
I wish somebody would help me with that .
Tom pretended he hadn &apos;t heard what Mary had said about him .
We have a lot of things we need to do today .
I &apos;ve tried doing it that way already .
You don &apos;t need to go if you don &apos;t want to .
I must do it now .
I slept for three hours this afternoon .
Let go of Tom .
I will go to the meeting .
Make it short , Tom .
You think I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
He said that he would help me .
I was very happy to hear the news .
The man hit me on the head .
You &apos;re welcome to move back to Boston .
What is Tom expecting Mary to do ?
Is that what you think of me ?
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom the truth .
Do you have any vacancies ?
I object to her going there alone .
I never imagined I &apos;d be working for you .
Tom enjoys playing the piano .
How do you do that ?
You &apos;re not helping .
Don &apos;t open the door no matter who comes .
Is this your bike ?
The dress suits you very well .
He wore old shoes .
I don &apos;t know when she got married .
I &apos;ll be arriving an hour late .
That wasn &apos;t very nice .
These aren &apos;t for you .
They live in another country .
He is in his library .
I know what I said .
Even a child knows that .
He was very happy .
I helped Tom a little bit .
You really did a good job .
None of us are against his idea .
It &apos;s been nice talking to you , but I really must go now .
Is that what you want , Tom ?
What else did you buy ?
Who helped Tom ?
What are you reading ?
Where can we meet you ?
Did Tom say what happened exactly ?
I don &apos;t have any money .
Who are you there with ?
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus .
What &apos;s for dinner ?
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
What are they doing here ?
You look good without your glasses on .
What &apos;s it going to be like ?
I can &apos;t make out what she said .
Go back to bed .
There is enough bread for all of you .
It &apos;ll be good .
I spent all night working on this report .
Come on , let &apos;s go .
I think this is for you .
Please turn off the light .
I am going to see him today .
I know where Tom will be three hours from now .
It helps .
You make me happy .
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him .
We &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
Don &apos;t be late for work .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom has left .
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
Your secret &apos;s safe .
Why won &apos;t Tom leave ?
I &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
You must stay awake .
What I &apos;m about to say will answer your question .
It is no use crying over spilt milk .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
You &apos;d better not do it .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
She prefers beer to wine .
The whole class is present today .
Tom couldn &apos;t find anyone to talk to .
I asked Tom where Mary was .
He looks his age .
I gave the book to my friend .
What do you and Tom want to do ?
You can &apos;t expect Tom to care about it the way you do .
You &apos;re not alone .
This is my friend , Tom .
Why don &apos;t you go to Boston ?
Everything that I saw was completely different from what I had expected .
Tom will talk .
You do ask a lot of questions .
If I don &apos;t do that , someone else will have to do it .
Tom and Mary are still not talking to each other .
Tom is a little crazy .
Tom looks tired .
What do you want with me ?
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here .
Tom knew it .
What do you like to read ?
I have the money .
I own this car .
I &apos;ll meet with Tom .
Why have you abandoned me ?
You &apos;re my friends .
Maybe Tom can help you .
Tom forgot to write to Mary .
Tom is always busy .
Tom may know why Mary has to do that .
That one &apos;s OK .
Do you have a table ?
Can you give me the keys ?
Tom asked Mary where she &apos;d been .
I have things to do tomorrow .
Tom worked .
You were right about everything .
How dangerous is the situation ?
That &apos;s how I see it .
Yesterday , I bought a book .
I can &apos;t help anyone .
Can you remember the first time we met each other ?
Uncle Tom is my mother &apos;s brother .
Tom very seldom goes anywhere anymore .
How long will we have ?
Tom ate at his desk .
What about a glass of beer ?
I don &apos;t know what they want .
My money was stolen .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
Where can I get some help ?
Tom says he &apos;s tired .
Is this your wine ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live here in Boston .
I have to ask Tom a question .
Who lives in this house ?
We live near a big library .
I want you to be nice to Tom .
My son is now as tall as I am .
Have you told your mother ?
I &apos;m not in love with Tom anymore .
I &apos;m studying French at home .
We went to Boston .
The only language Tom can speak is French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Is Tom good at cooking ?
I hope you and Tom will like it here .
You went to the park yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom stole money from me .
I was planning on telling you today .
He is asleep .
Is this your letter ?
Tom and I were married to each other for three years .
I have the keys .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
Tom is very happy here .
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said ?
She decided to get married to Tom .
Tom wants to marry me .
You can &apos;t please everyone .
He told me that he was busy .
It is likely to rain soon .
I am going to study .
I &apos;m here to see Tom .
People don &apos;t know how to drive around here .
You know how important you are to me .
What kind of music do you like ?
I am going to swim a lot this summer .
Tom isn &apos;t coming today .
He started his day with a good breakfast .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was a doctor .
My father has been dead for three years .
I &apos;ve got a job .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you really want to know , all you have to do is ask .
I cannot do without this book .
The baby is due any day now .
How long has he been dead ?
It &apos;s my last offer .
I wasn &apos;t overly tired .
He tries .
He easily gets angry .
Where &apos;s the park ?
I had him take my suitcase to the room .
Do you have time ?
That &apos;s what made me happy .
I &apos;ll get the book .
Tom would like to have a girlfriend .
Who else knows ?
We can &apos;t win .
I &apos;d like to think that there &apos;s more to it than that .
I stay home alone while my parents are at work .
Tom stopped reading .
He will be a good teacher .
I called Tom up .
I think Tom knows where Mary lives .
Your father seems very nice .
I want to live in the country .
Tom bought his daughter a dress .
I have a lot of land .
Tom said that you wanted to study abroad .
I &apos;m not going to your house .
How do you think that makes me feel ?
If you want , I can show you how to do that .
I &apos;m sorry , but I didn &apos;t know it was a secret .
There &apos;s only one way to be sure .
Please let us know if we can help in other ways .
We came here looking for you .
Tom should run .
She often goes to the movies with him .
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you sick ?
My watch may be one or two minutes fast .
Let us know by next Monday .
We need to help Tom .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning .
I will help you .
What &apos;s the big idea ?
Tom and his friends are outside .
Tom said nothing at all .
What do you want to study at college ?
I haven &apos;t seen anything of him lately .
I &apos;m really hungry .
I barely made the train .
You don &apos;t have to be crazy to work here .
Did something happen ?
Please drop in to see us next time you come to Boston .
They all speak French .
I &apos;ll give Tom whatever he wants .
I did what Tom wanted me to do .
It &apos;s getting late . I don &apos;t wanna go home alone .
He plays the piano better than me .
What do you think Tom is doing ?
We won &apos;t be back here again until next year .
Tom wants Mary to say yes .
Why don &apos;t you come over to my house for dinner tomorrow ?
You don &apos;t want to make Tom mad , do you ?
I think this is mine .
I don &apos;t know what Tom has to do .
I don &apos;t like this type of house .
I think you can help us .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
Tom took off his hat .
Tom was cautious .
Where do you want it ?
What was Tom wearing when he died ?
Why don &apos;t you give Tom a chance ?
You &apos;re old enough now .
No one has that right .
This book is especially difficult to read .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is saying what she really thinks .
Is Boston far away ?
Where are the apples ?
Is his father a doctor ?
Why do you care so much ?
You should do that right away .
Is today Monday ?
It &apos;s almost six .
You must not be late for school .
I do not fear death .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
Nobody can help you .
I don &apos;t ever want to speak to Tom again .
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her .
What &apos;s your price ?
This is serious .
Have you written to Tom ?
Tom knows what he wants .
We &apos;ll run in the park .
Someone opened the window .
I don &apos;t feel up to running to the station .
I can &apos;t tell you how sorry I am .
Someone gave me this .
Just say you &apos;re sorry .
Tom waited outside .
What made you want to do that ?
I want to read this book .
Tom seems a little nervous .
I must apologize for not having written for such a long time .
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
What &apos;s the matter ?
Is this correct ?
He was wearing glasses .
Thank you .
I don &apos;t know how to drive .
Here she is !
Tom has to be home .
Now that we &apos;re alone , let &apos;s have fun .
It was my fault .
Well , I have to go now .
I don &apos;t know exactly .
We can &apos;t be too careful .
I &apos;ve never played tennis with Tom .
Isn &apos;t the answer easy ?
They saw me .
You &apos;re cooperating .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
Tell us something we don &apos;t know .
I think I &apos;m going to stay here .
I will not be busy tomorrow .
That &apos;s my final answer .
You can &apos;t talk to Tom like that .
What are those ?
May I go now ?
No one will believe me .
I &apos;m at the hospital now .
It &apos;s good seeing you .
He was absent from school yesterday .
I want eggs for breakfast tomorrow morning .
I ran to school .
She has gone abroad .
Look what I did .
I barely know Tom .
Tom is waiting for you .
You &apos;re in the way .
He seems kind .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
I wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
I have no plans for tonight .
He &apos;s right behind you .
How did you come to know this ?
Tom saw you .
I want to do everything I &apos;m expected to do .
I &apos;d like to work with Tom .
I go to work .
Tom stopped eating .
He doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
Tom was reading the newspaper .
I am always proud of my family .
I &apos;ve got a secret .
How much money do you have ?
Have another .
You can sleep on the couch .
He has written two books .
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
How &apos;s the world treating you ?
I don &apos;t know how I should do it .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him in front of the library .
It &apos;s your decision .
I know that you still love me .
Can you see that ?
I need a computer .
You can have as many as you want .
Your name &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
I finally have enough money to buy Tom that camera he &apos;s wanted .
She shouted for help , but no one came .
I saw the film and found it interesting .
We have to study .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
I &apos;ll be in Boston for a few days next week .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
I am busy now .
It &apos;s not a fish .
I &apos;m just trying to help .
I thought you cared about Tom .
Tom scares me .
Did you really talk to Tom ?
I know how to do this .
Tom appeared calm .
You are entirely correct .
We &apos;re university students .
Tom arrived at work at 2 : 30 .
Tom told me what happened .
You &apos;ve found it .
I know all their names .
Give me something to eat .
This dictionary can also help you .
That &apos;s how I like things .
Has Tom spoken to you about me ?
When did you buy this car ?
What hat do you like ?
Why did you invite Tom to the party ?
Why didn &apos;t you just ask ?
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
I am happy that you are my friend .
It &apos;s important to Tom .
Tom wanted to learn how to read .
Where did I leave my glasses ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is able to do that or not .
We &apos;ll tell Tom .
The only thing we can do is wait .
Did you tell Tom about Mary ?
Tom isn &apos;t very tough .
I &apos;ll be back at six-thirty .
I &apos;m sorry that you can &apos;t come this evening .
I often played tennis when I was young .
She is no less beautiful than her sister .
I look forward to meeting Tom .
What will they do ?
You look very happy this morning .
Tom and Mary are doing fine .
Tom is fast , but Mary isn &apos;t .
Tom was telling the truth .
Tom sleeps all day and is up all night .
This is Tom .
I can &apos;t do it .
Tom barely speaks to me anymore .
You look like my sister .
It &apos;s no trouble at all .
Thanks for coming .
We had an examination yesterday .
The child cried for help .
Tom is Mary &apos;s boss .
No one ever tells me anything around here .
Tom may be in Boston .
It would be crazy to do that again .
I considered Tom .
We &apos;re not doing anything .
I arrived late for the celebration .
Who &apos;s at the door ?
I have only just arrived .
Mary went about her business as if nothing had happened .
Tom thinks he knows what to do .
They &apos;re still young .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been saying all along .
Is that boy Tom ?
You didn &apos;t come here alone , did you ?
Tom had a good reason for not going .
What would you like ?
I have to know why .
Did you get her letter ?
I had some trouble in finding his house .
Would you like to eat with us ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
He speaks ten languages .
His old cat is still alive .
How did you learn to speak French so well ?
I got married 8 years ago .
You have to speak only English .
I hope we find Tom .
What do you want for lunch ?
You &apos;d better go back home now .
He got into bed .
We &apos;ll get it .
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
Without your help , Tom doesn &apos;t have a chance .
I wish Tom had never gotten out of prison .
Tom was content .
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t help ?
They saw you .
What does he intend to do ?
I know that you still think about me .
Tom expected more .
This must be the place .
I made him go .
Tom seems a little jumpy , doesn &apos;t he ?
This is on you .
I intend to try .
You can &apos;t drink the water here .
I didn &apos;t know where to look .
Tom will probably never walk again .
He , and he alone , must go .
I &apos;d rather not sing tonight .
How about you come with me ?
I hate to see you like this .
I gave the books to this student .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
You know some French , don &apos;t you ?
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was already married .
I &apos;ll try harder .
Mary makes more money than her husband .
I wrote it myself .
I need only one cat .
Would you like to say anything ?
Which one do you like best ?
Tom knows how to make Mary happy .
That is what I have wanted to buy .
I bought many books .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
I don &apos;t remember being given a choice .
I have a lot of work to finish up before the end of the week .
All men are equal .
I hardly know anything about Australia .
I had no idea you were here .
I have to go to bed .
How did you meet Tom initially ?
I love my mother very much .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
Do you have children ?
Tom doesn &apos;t get out of the city much .
Tom bought a camera from Mary .
I think that was the best movie I &apos;ve ever seen .
I really don &apos;t think I can do that .
Tom got Mary to drive John and Alice home .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
We were very disappointed in that girl .
You should think about your future .
No one is coming with me .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
What does Tom want from me ?
Everybody ran outside .
Tom looked at his watch .
She has known him only a fortnight .
Do you want to know the future ?
It is just a year since I got married .
Don &apos;t you want these ?
I &apos;m as old as Tom is .
I want them all .
I like to come here .
I thought you &apos;d never visit us again .
Tom is with his mother .
I wanted to make Tom feel at home .
What did Tom tell Mary not to do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants .
Tom knows he shouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom went without lunch because he didn &apos;t have enough time to eat .
Tom is so much older than I am .
That &apos;ll pass .
Tom never works on Sunday .
It was my idea .
Tom held up his hands .
I &apos;ll make myself a sandwich .
She &apos;s my best friend .
What &apos;s your take on this ?
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
That is what I want to know .
I want to learn French .
Put your hands up !
That bicycle is mine .
You need to apologize to her and need to do it right away .
Whenever I see Tom , I &apos;m reminded of his father .
I &apos;m taller than you .
Why did he do such a thing ?
I wonder why Tom did that .
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
How well do you sing ?
Tom knows why Mary is in Boston .
It &apos;s too difficult .
What are Tom and Mary doing here ?
This might be Tom &apos;s desk .
We are going to meet him tonight .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
I don &apos;t recall asking for your opinion .
You guys need each other .
I cannot possibly help you .
My son won &apos;t listen to me .
Tom is here in Boston with me .
How do I fix this problem ?
Tom made a lot of mistakes .
Tom is listening to music in his room .
They can &apos;t give me what I want .
Please go to the bench .
Tom stayed behind .
This one belongs to Tom .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
I can &apos;t help you unless you tell me the truth .
Tom already knows .
I &apos;ll give you an answer in a day or two .
What does Tom have to do with this matter ?
I hope the bread keeps until tomorrow .
Tom wouldn &apos;t come .
Can I have some more tea ?
Tom didn &apos;t do it .
Tom had dinner by himself .
I am still alone .
This is really big .
Tom has more money in the bank than I do .
I just gave Tom 30 dollars .
He started singing .
I &apos;m not your friend .
I &apos;m sure Tom will apologize .
How did you enjoy the party ?
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go to Boston .
I suppose you know everything Tom did .
Are they your friends ?
I &apos;m glad I could help you .
You should go home . It &apos;s late and you &apos;re drunk .
How long have you known Tom ?
He wants to see if he &apos;s still got what it takes .
She went with him to the movies .
You can only use it once .
They aren &apos;t waiting for the bus .
The night is still young .
It &apos;s what I want .
You shouldn &apos;t make fun of Tom .
Perhaps I can help you .
Tom isn &apos;t sleeping .
Tom won &apos;t be here until later .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Did you like Boston ?
Rain is scarce in this country .
How many flowers did you buy ?
Tom has something he wants to say to you .
You should be in a hospital .
This makes no sense .
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow .
You must not do it now .
The three of them all just looked at Tom .
We don &apos;t make mistakes .
Why does everyone think I &apos;m stupid ?
I haven &apos;t finished my homework yet .
I &apos;m not your son .
Show me your passport , please .
Tom put on a coat .
This isn &apos;t good .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
She can &apos;t have said so .
Where do we know each other from ?
That &apos;s what Tom says .
Won &apos;t you take a chair ?
He wishes to become a doctor .
Just tell me what happened .
Tom can &apos;t keep his eyes off Mary .
Can your mother drive a car ?
Tom isn &apos;t coming .
I know who you were with .
Is there another door ?
I know what I want . I just haven &apos;t found it yet .
It was far from certain .
I &apos;ve been better .
Tom and Mary think I don &apos;t know .
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
I &apos;m all right .
I &apos;ve read both books .
Tom shouted .
Tom has gone too far .
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened to me .
I &apos;m crazy about you .
Tom is rich , but he isn &apos;t happy .
I think you &apos;d better leave .
Tom stopped the car and got out .
People are looking at you .
Who &apos;s the little guy ?
I know as little as you do .
I didn &apos;t have any problems .
Tom understands what you don &apos;t .
Tom came home .
My hair has grown too long .
We never forget .
Tom was running .
We &apos;re undressing .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
I want my mom .
What &apos;s Tom like ?
How many boys are there in your class ?
I know that most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
How would you like it if someone did that to you ?
I &apos;ll have to explain that to my father .
We don &apos;t hire women .
Tom , is that you ?
It was not easy for us to find his house .
Tom comes here every three days .
I &apos;ll never forget that .
I &apos;m older than you think I am .
I think Tom can help you .
He wrote me from Japan .
Tom told me what he thinks about my plan .
Tom tried to sleep , but couldn &apos;t .
He looked well .
Have you tried it before ?
I thought you &apos;d like it .
Do you know anything about Tom &apos;s parents ?
I need this job .
My mother objects to smoking .
I &apos;m going to be ready in five minutes .
I think he &apos;s right .
Tom came to my office this morning .
I don &apos;t care if you believe me .
Come along with me .
Tom wanted a bicycle .
It &apos;s time for bed .
She makes me happy .
I tried to make sure that everyone had fun .
Don &apos;t go too far away .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
If you &apos;re not quiet , I &apos;m going to ask you to leave .
I don &apos;t have any brothers .
He stayed up late last night .
Tom walked past Mary .
I wish I had a brother .
Tom had a grand time .
Tom is a good guitarist .
Tom heard Mary yelling his name .
She is everything to him .
How much does Tom earn a month ?
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
Who &apos;ll go ?
I can do more .
I tried really hard .
I assume it &apos;s not good .
Things didn &apos;t go according to plan .
Tom is working with us .
They found something .
Have you made a decision ?
We can &apos;t do this without some help .
She requested help , but no one came .
The park was empty .
It is very hot today .
Do it tomorrow .
We &apos;re here to help them .
We have a few questions for you .
Everyone &apos;s dead .
How often do you work here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
I have to get that .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
What else did you say ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll lose .
Tom said he was having problems with Mary .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
As I told you earlier , I can &apos;t help you .
How old is your dog ?
I have several good friends .
Tom is taller than his father .
It &apos;s not as easy as you think .
He is old enough to understand it .
I should apologize to Tom .
You don &apos;t want that , do you ?
Did you enjoy the game ?
Just what exactly are you trying to say ?
Can I help you folks ?
Tom said to ask you .
I am not always free on Sundays .
I &apos;m doing this for my family .
Let &apos;s go out for a walk .
You should stay in school .
They get along great .
I hear someone coming .
Tom isn &apos;t finished yet .
Don &apos;t leave the TV on .
That is not altogether false .
What you say is right .
That &apos;s not exactly what happened .
Tom tried to blame me for everything .
Stop here .
It works pretty well here .
Not everyone in town likes you .
The police never showed up .
Tom loves me and I love him , too .
We &apos;re very satisfied with it .
The movie wasn &apos;t all that great .
Grab as much as you need .
Are you students at this school ?
That &apos;s the way I like it .
That doesn &apos;t answer my question .
I love being alone .
You &apos;re paying .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I have something to ask Tom .
I don &apos;t understand that at all .
Tom talked to Mary as well .
I &apos;ve come to see you .
I have to go to Boston .
Do you know Tom &apos;s phone number ?
I don &apos;t know where you are going .
Nobody asked for your help .
I hate winter .
Let &apos;s go to my place .
He has lost face .
He stood by me whenever I was in trouble .
I have to come on Monday .
Tom won &apos;t be going to school next week .
I had a good time last evening .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his parents to find out .
An idea occurred to me .
He can &apos;t swim .
I don &apos;t really understand why .
Tom &apos;s free .
Take my advice .
I don &apos;t think Tom saw us .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
I &apos;m glad we agree .
We both know what you &apos;re doing .
Tom soon fell asleep .
Do you know what this is ?
He walks slowly .
That &apos;s my car .
The desk seems small in this room .
You &apos;ll do no such thing .
Is that your final decision ?
I guess that &apos;s good .
I can &apos;t repair the computer .
I saw Tom on Monday .
Why are men like that ?
Tom found a job .
What kind of books do you like to read ?
We can &apos;t do it without you .
The bus stops in front of my house .
I will be back at half past six .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
I haven &apos;t told anyone anything .
Tom wants to be rich .
He must be crazy to do such a thing .
Tom asked Mary if she loved him .
I &apos;m really looking forward to it .
I have three friends who can speak French .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
You &apos;re really lucky .
I got the money back from him .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
Have you ever seen anything like this ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking you .
What are you people thinking ?
How did you learn to speak French so well ?
I &apos;m out here .
If you were in my place , what would you do ?
I don &apos;t want to go home .
I &apos;m thinking of going abroad .
I didn &apos;t like Boston at all .
Tom plans to go to Boston by himself .
Is there anyone you didn &apos;t tell ?
One who has everything can lose everything .
&quot; Perhaps we &apos;d better not tell Tom anything about today . &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot;
Tom and Mary already know each other .
She is not young .
Is that the train I have to take ?
We both know what happened .
He was not feeling well .
She isn &apos;t good enough for him .
Tom had some questions he wanted to ask .
Where could they be ?
The newspaper is by your side .
It &apos;s all your fault .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
I &apos;d like some fish .
My mother plays the piano well .
I don &apos;t know what to think of this .
As is often the case with him , he was late again .
Tom isn &apos;t the same age as Mary .
We still love each other .
Never ask a question if you aren &apos;t prepared to hear the answer .
I &apos;m disappointed in you .
They &apos;re our friends .
I have to go see Tom .
This is fine .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be so stupid .
Tom does nothing but eat and sleep .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
She suggested that I give it to him right away .
Tom succeeded .
Is this the book you &apos;re looking for ?
All the money was gone .
I &apos;m going to drive myself .
Tom could die .
What have we here ?
Tom says he &apos;s very rich .
Tom rarely spoke .
Mary and I are getting married .
That &apos;s what I would do in your place .
He forgot my birthday .
You must be cautious .
Such a thing has never happened to me .
I hate people who say that .
I &apos;ll buy this .
You should &apos;ve let us know you were coming .
Tom is good at explaining things .
I just saw you guys three days ago .
You like doing that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom hung up the phone .
Don &apos;t say it like that .
The baby opened his mouth .
You said you &apos;d do it for me .
Tom spent the night at a friend &apos;s house .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you . Thank you .
The rain continued all day .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you &apos;re looking for him .
What do you really think ?
Tom isn &apos;t able to drive yet .
I &apos;m sorry , but he isn &apos;t home .
My father is busy now .
I almost died today .
Tom says he has a plan .
I have lots of things to do .
What &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?
I didn &apos;t hear her coming .
We are hungry .
I had fun with it .
No one can help you .
I think they like us .
Tom saw something behind Mary .
I can open the window .
We love this school .
Tom has bought a house in Boston .
This is the boy who helped me .
Let &apos;s go !
One shouldn &apos;t worry about what people are going to say .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy about it .
I &apos;m very glad to hear the news .
I never imagined that you would say that .
I wish I could sing as well as you do .
Tom is going to look after Mary .
I think you &apos;re working way too hard .
He had fun with it .
Tom is good at that .
Your question is hard to answer .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t yet told anyone they plan to get married .
I don &apos;t think I like that .
I &apos;m going to school in Boston .
Say what you have to say .
Will you give me something to drink ?
That is his house .
Tom can &apos;t cook well .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you dance .
Is Tom crazy ?
You ought not to have done that .
I think they like you .
I don &apos;t understand what you are saying .
It only happened once .
My train left at six and arrived at ten .
Have you written to Tom ?
You got what you deserve .
Tom asked Mary about her new boyfriend .
The car moved very slowly .
What &apos;s ours is ours .
This isn &apos;t worth it .
I need to go eat something .
Do you think it was Tom who did that ?
What do you have to say about that ?
You are not to blame for the accident .
Where is your school ?
I got a taxi in front of the station .
He died before I arrived .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t wait any longer .
The sun is rising .
Everyone knows everyone .
Both of my parents are still living .
What a good idea !
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve felt this bad .
That is the shop where I used to work .
I can hardly find time to do that anymore .
We must not speak in the library .
I wish I could have gone with her .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
I want something to drink .
When did he fall ill ?
Why are you being so kind ?
You &apos;re trying too hard .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
I was a teacher .
I can &apos;t get Tom to even talk to me .
My speech will only be about three minutes long .
She &apos;s my daughter .
The bed takes up a lot of room .
She is wearing a hat .
You &apos;re a better cook than I am .
Tom is doing that for Mary .
I almost died .
You can do it at your leisure .
If you guys want to sleep here , it &apos;s no problem .
I can &apos;t wait .
Tom can &apos;t even ride a bicycle .
We remember .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
You have a good plan .
Why don &apos;t you believe me ?
We &apos;re pretty proud of ourselves .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
I &apos;m as tall as my father .
This isn &apos;t French .
Tom saw you do that .
Mary is older than her husband .
Tom isn &apos;t quiet .
I can sleep on the couch .
His health ebbed slowly away .
You &apos;re never satisfied .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom not to come .
What age was she when she first drove a car ?
He can &apos;t afford to buy a new car .
Do you know how to drive ?
He wants to get a new dictionary .
Time is up .
I have already written a letter .
That girl is good-looking .
Tom loves animals .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
That &apos;s all I have .
Tom has already finished the work .
Tom gave us some food .
My father is very nice .
I ran for my life .
Tom bikes to work .
I thought that Tom was married .
I &apos;m not going to stay here with you .
That &apos;s not good for your health .
She had no brother .
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
You &apos;re just making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
Where do these come from ?
I tried to stay awake .
Maybe they know something .
There are still many things left to do .
Tom is still considering doing that .
See you there .
I won &apos;t leave without you .
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
Can you swim ?
Do you know where we live ?
I &apos;ve got a little job for you .
You &apos;re the one that wanted to see me , aren &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re good at doing that .
You don &apos;t want me here , do you ?
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing before he goes home .
I wish I could speak French as well as you do .
We need to do it immediately .
I really don &apos;t want to live here .
Give me your knife .
Do you know who those people are ?
I don &apos;t feel hungry at all .
What can you tell me about it ?
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
Maybe we &apos;ll try again later .
Tom doesn &apos;t watch a lot of TV .
The answer was easy .
She is very fond of dogs .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
He didn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
The report is utterly false .
He was wearing glasses .
What &apos;s Tom doing in Boston ?
I can speak a little French .
Tom is hurting .
You &apos;re here early .
Why do you want to know that ?
Tom is really quiet .
He was ill , so he couldn &apos;t come .
Nobody here does that .
I want to work at a hospital .
I think Tom did exactly what he said he did .
You can sleep on the couch .
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
I do that , too .
They became nervous .
I just hope no one saw me .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom realized that he wasn &apos;t the same as the other kids .
Tom is reading a book .
Their daughter studies in that school .
I will have finished the work by noon .
Where does your family live ?
Did you go and see Tom ?
Can you see Tom ?
I only wish I could help all of you .
You have to ask Tom first .
Did Tom really help you ?
Tom is really sorry .
Tom is not our man .
What &apos;ll Tom do ?
You might not want to go there by yourself .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
What is it you want from me ?
Tom is now staying in Boston .
I &apos;ll give you my opinion .
How fast were you driving ?
How lucky I am !
Tom won &apos;t discuss the problem with me .
I thought Tom said he wasn &apos;t going to get married .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study in Boston .
You had better not see her today .
Yesterday , Tom told me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
Everybody is very busy .
Someone called .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
Can you read this ?
I think we &apos;re out of danger .
I have nothing to do at the moment .
Who &apos;ll look after your dog tomorrow ?
Have you ever driven a car to Boston ?
I don &apos;t like what I see .
We have a test tomorrow .
I want to know what it is .
She is out now .
This book isn &apos;t as heavy as that one .
Tom isn &apos;t going to want to do that .
I &apos;m not feeling very well .
I saw your father .
What are people saying ?
The girl sat beside me .
What does the cat want ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy .
I hope Tom says yes .
Somebody made a mistake .
It &apos;s too hard .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will be here .
Does Tom still remember me ?
Go take a walk .
Tom is afraid of you .
We do what we want to do .
I want your love .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
Tom is there , too .
There also was another reason .
You seem content .
I &apos;m not going to ask again .
Tom is saying something .
Parents love their children .
He knows us very well .
Tom got off the bus .
You can &apos;t handle this alone .
How long will it take ?
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
I was just trying to help .
I ate an apple .
Tom and Mary have been playing tennis all day .
I believe what is written in her letter .
I &apos;ve never been married .
You &apos;re not too old to do that .
Have you really talked to Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t like his brother .
She asked him for help .
She could solve the problem with ease .
No one said anything .
No one takes Tom seriously .
Will you make room for me ?
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I thought that you were my best friend .
Tom cannot drive .
I hope that won &apos;t happen again .
Where are Tom &apos;s keys ?
What does Tom know about this ?
I don &apos;t know her real name .
We can &apos;t go back .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing this ?
What kind of women do you like ?
Mary and I became good friends .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
What would you like to have ?
I can &apos;t answer this question .
Tom needs to be very careful .
Tom showed interest in the plan .
Does Tom do that for money ?
I think this is a good thing .
Tom wants to go home .
Give it to Tom .
Tell us how you did it .
It &apos;s not my cup of tea .
He stopped reading the newspaper .
What do you want to do with that ?
Tom should have told Mary the truth .
You &apos;ve done it again .
How many people are there ?
Tom is going to come on Monday .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
When &apos;s Tom going to get here ?
I came to this country for the purpose of studying music .
Thanks for meeting me .
Take this home with you .
The kitchen in that house is very nice .
Don &apos;t worry about me .
Tom has many friends in Boston .
I only speak French with Tom .
I &apos;m free on Sunday .
Do you think Tom is still interested ?
Tom seems to be sleeping .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
I don &apos;t have a picture of you .
I want to try it . It looks fun .
I &apos;d like to give it to Tom .
Tom ran outside .
I hope you aren &apos;t too disappointed .
Do you have my book ?
I &apos;m running out of time .
This book belongs to the library .
I &apos;ll ask Tom for you .
I &apos;ll be there all day .
He left the house .
We &apos;re all going .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I &apos;ve got to go .
He and I are friends .
I want you to think about this .
Who &apos;s there ?
Tom was sitting on a bench .
I can &apos;t get that song out of my head .
Tom phoned me yesterday from Boston .
I plan to go back to Boston as soon as I can .
He pretended not to know me .
I &apos;m dying .
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
I had my watch stolen .
I &apos;m not going to answer any more questions .
That &apos;s not how Tom sees it .
I think you &apos;d like that .
Do you have it ?
Have you read this book ?
You made too many mistakes .
Tom is hard to please .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than Mary .
Tom still speaks French every day .
Can I talk to you in private ?
You &apos;re right .
I feel better today .
Certainly they will go on holiday next month .
Tom went swimming with his friends .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
My car is very old , but it still runs fairly well .
Tom drives safely .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
We &apos;re willing to learn .
Tell Tom what &apos;s wrong .
Tom finally left .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary .
I think I don &apos;t understand you .
Tom didn &apos;t get it either .
Tom did that really well .
I am surprised to learn this .
You don &apos;t know what I want .
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
I &apos;m glad I don &apos;t need that .
Is Tom with us ?
This is not quite enough .
Is Tom in ?
Who can tell what will happen in the future ?
Tom writes slowly .
Tom and I want to go home .
I cannot possibly help you .
Tom &apos;s house is within walking distance of the nearest train station .
Tom said that it might be true .
I &apos;m not having a good day .
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
They were afraid .
Tom lives on this street .
People make mistakes .
Tom went home by taxi .
Tom was with a girl , but I didn &apos;t manage to see who it was .
You &apos;re very rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t understand you .
She loves her children .
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to ?
Can I ask a question ?
May I have a word with you ?
Tom is studying in the library now .
I &apos;m giving you what you want .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem happy .
He has a hat on .
I will come by all means .
When did you buy it ?
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this .
Tom wondered where he was supposed to sit .
Do you have a dictionary ?
I believe it &apos;s finished .
I said I &apos;d be there .
Here he is !
They &apos;re in Boston .
Tom &apos;s house is easy to find .
He gave it to me .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom is now .
This isn &apos;t your house .
I want you to leave us alone .
He is as tall as my father .
I really don &apos;t know Tom that well .
I seem to have done something wrong .
Do you want something to drink ?
She got home at seven .
How can we meet new people ?
Men are better at this than women .
My room has two windows .
Tom has turned thirty .
Tom found me a good job .
You are free to say what you think .
I can &apos;t keep my eyes off of it .
I think I remember you .
He will come home in a few days .
Tom is busy now .
How would we get it done ?
Tom didn &apos;t think so .
We know each other , but not all that well .
That &apos;s really good news .
You &apos;re not expected to do anything we wouldn &apos;t do ourselves .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Could you open the window ?
I don &apos;t like this book .
This is the book I told you about .
Tom wrote this report by himself .
What do you say to that ?
Mary is my daughter .
Money can &apos;t buy happiness .
You won &apos;t believe this .
What &apos;s your son &apos;s name ?
I want what &apos;s mine .
Girls don &apos;t like you .
Tom isn &apos;t foolish .
He &apos;ll be taking an exam next week .
I &apos;m much older than you think I am .
Tom told me .
Someone opened the door .
We want to have a baby .
You could &apos;ve died .
I know that you know that I know .
Do you know something about this ?
This bag is not small .
I can be there in 30 minutes .
What about his girlfriend ?
What &apos;ve you got ?
Have you asked the others ?
The sun doesn &apos;t always shine .
You never know what &apos;ll happen .
Aren &apos;t you hot ?
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
I study many languages .
They &apos;re crazy .
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening .
Do you know where we are ?
I &apos;m here again .
I &apos;m taking off .
Do you know whether Tom can speak French ?
There isn &apos;t anybody else .
I played tennis .
There were a lot of people in the room .
This is for you .
I &apos;m certain that he has finished .
Tom was only in Australia for a couple of weeks .
I learned this song from Tom .
How do you go to work ?
Tom can come , too .
She often comes late .
This is the camera I bought yesterday .
No one is listening to me .
Tom waited more than an hour .
Neither of us can speak French .
Tom was wealthy .
Tom says what he thinks .
Who saw you ?
I know what that is .
How did you find us ?
He was disappointed .
It &apos;s the only thing we can do .
I don &apos;t think they like me .
He made believe he was a doctor .
Do you plan to go abroad ?
She went for a walk .
Who &apos;s the girl in this picture ?
I can &apos;t wait that long .
Is Tom your name ?
Tom didn &apos;t call .
It &apos;s too hot .
I need to know everything there is to know about Tom .
It &apos;s a long story .
It &apos;s about time .
It doesn &apos;t look very fun , does it ?
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to Boston with me .
This building belongs to us .
Can I have a moment ?
I &apos;d like to help you .
This should be clear to everyone .
He came here to help me .
No one knows that I like you .
I &apos;ll be here until next week .
How do I look tonight ?
The old man said something .
I don &apos;t know anybody who can speak French .
I am injured .
Why do you put up with that ?
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant .
I ate too much food yesterday .
That &apos;s your problem .
I had fun doing that .
You don &apos;t have to tell it to me if you don &apos;t want to .
What &apos;re you reading ?
We &apos;re brother and sister .
Can you show me the house ?
We have no water .
We &apos;ll deal with it later .
The cat likes to sleep beside me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know he shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
That could &apos;ve gone better .
Have you eaten dinner ?
We can &apos;t tell Tom .
I believe you .
I know what Tom needs to do .
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary &apos;s school .
She looks very happy .
He blamed me for the accident .
Is there anywhere you want to go ?
I asked him if he wanted a watch .
Is Tom there , too ?
Mary is my wife .
We keep three dogs and a cat .
I no longer want that .
Give me your keys .
Tom came back inside the room .
There were three men in the room .
Those are our books .
I thought you &apos;d like to see this .
Did you find your keys ?
Nothing can be done .
Tom is enjoying himself .
Tom still goes to school .
Give that to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to cook .
Where am I ?
I have a gift for you .
Who told you the story ?
Nobody &apos;s busy .
Tom found nothing .
If you don &apos;t do that , neither will I .
She isn &apos;t afraid of death .
I did not expect it to be that big .
I think you &apos;re dumb .
This is difficult .
He is proud of being a doctor .
He is soon to be a father .
Tom heard Mary singing in the kitchen .
I &apos;ll be thinking of you today .
I didn &apos;t know that she had a child .
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
Who else could &apos;ve done it ?
We regret doing that .
I don &apos;t want to have to do this .
How can I explain this ?
Tom always looked busy , but never was .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go .
Let Tom go .
This isn &apos;t news to anyone .
Tom &apos;s alone .
Tom didn &apos;t think it was a problem .
You are the one .
How many languages do you speak well ?
What &apos;ll you eat for dinner tonight ?
I can &apos;t do that .
Tom usually eats his lunch alone .
How much does Tom spend a month ?
You eat too much .
Mary didn &apos;t get along well with the other girls .
They helped Tom .
Has Tom told Mary about how he met John ?
Tom said John is a good man .
The old man spoke to me in French .
I got it for next to nothing .
Tom very seldom does that anymore .
I will help him tomorrow .
What &apos;s that got to do with Tom ?
Tom has been getting up early .
That was well worth the trouble .
We can &apos;t open this yet .
When will you finish your homework ?
Let me go !
Tom comes to visit us every now and then .
Let Tom sleep .
Look carefully . I &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done .
Don &apos;t do this again .
No one lives here anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t appear to be nervous .
I have been to the library .
What did you do at that moment ?
Tom nearly died .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
How is Tom going to Boston ?
It &apos;ll be over soon .
I can &apos;t make out what she wants .
We &apos;ll be there by 2 : 30 .
Tom hit me on the head .
He &apos;s now on the phone .
You are tall , but he is still taller .
He needed the money .
We did that just for fun .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
Tom wasn &apos;t eating .
Yesterday was hot .
I can still hear your voice .
Tom got along with everybody .
I knew you &apos;d be happy here .
I want you to tell me everything you know about that .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
I didn &apos;t want to say anything , but I had no choice .
We &apos;ll meet right here .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
We &apos;ve known each other for over thirty years .
I am very hungry .
How did you come by that much money ?
You need to do exactly what I tell you .
Tom was very drunk .
Tom isn &apos;t the one , is he ?
Why do you want to help the police ?
I am quite comfortable in this room .
Does it really matter ?
Did you invite him ?
I need someone who I can talk to .
Tom was often late for school .
I wrote this book .
I meant to call you .
Father bought me a camera .
You should have come earlier .
I saw it coming .
Tom is going to have to do it .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
This must be my book .
I love coming to Boston .
I can walk from my house to the station in only five minutes .
We have been together for a year .
This is the best book I have ever read .
Have you finished reading the book ?
This would be better than that .
This is what happens when you don &apos;t pay attention to what you &apos;re doing .
Her story is true .
Let &apos;s have a party tonight .
Tom &apos;s got school tomorrow .
I bought the book for ten dollars .
What more can I do ?
I took the bus back .
Go to the hospital .
You aren &apos;t very happy , are you ?
I will eat supper at seven .
Tom is in the house .
What &apos;s written in the book ?
Let &apos;s ask him .
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
Tom hardly talks at all .
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not good enough .
I have no idea where the others are .
He is now almost as tall as his father .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to pretend that he liked Mary .
I wouldn &apos;t mind a beer right now .
You can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about me .
The problem was very difficult .
He failed the exam .
Don &apos;t make a mistake .
Doing that won &apos;t solve anything .
Tom bought too much bread .
I need to stop .
I got into bed and immediately fell asleep .
It &apos;s starting now .
We have three minutes .
We &apos;ve been talking about you .
Is my French really so bad ?
You should not give your children everything they want .
That &apos;s really stupid .
He laid himself on the bed .
We should probably ask Tom .
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train .
Tom rode his bicycle to school yesterday .
Today is Tom &apos;s birthday .
This is all the money I have .
Tom is older than I am .
I should &apos;ve stayed .
No one saw us .
I didn &apos;t expect that to come from you .
I &apos;m not satisfied .
Tom didn &apos;t get very far .
I want them .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had just gotten married .
You can &apos;t seat Tom next to Mary .
Anyone could have made it .
What are you planning to do ?
He is not stupid .
Nobody knows where he lives .
That &apos;s not a bad idea .
I don &apos;t understand this at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I can swim .
Tom had to go himself .
He will not listen to me .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell us anything .
Where does it hurt ?
Tom arrived home at 2 : 30 .
There is a woman who wants to see you .
He could not swim .
Tom had only three dollars on him .
You just have to know that it works . You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
I had to stay at home .
I wonder what Tom is doing .
I know how happy you are .
Did you see anybody there ?
I said what had to be said .
This is where Tom met Mary for the first time .
I think that Tom is sick .
I want to know what you &apos;ll do .
I don &apos;t think so .
I have money for you .
I have something to say .
I won &apos;t let you escape .
I want an answer from you as soon as possible .
I don &apos;t like the house he is living in .
The old man lives alone .
Can you come ?
He arrived earlier than usual .
You must show me how it works .
Are you ready to hear the bad news ?
She &apos;s busy .
We don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s true .
Tom wants to be finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
You have to go to the party .
He wants to go to America .
The door closed slowly .
Give me just a little .
It is important to help each other .
We aren &apos;t always right .
She bought a dictionary for her sister .
We &apos;re not the only ones who &apos;ve made mistakes .
What else can I do for you ?
We &apos;re not allowed to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have long to wait .
Would you like to play a game ?
They didn &apos;t tell me so .
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
Aren &apos;t you afraid ?
I want to live in Boston .
I need them .
I don &apos;t want you to go .
The woman is reading .
I don &apos;t want to know about it .
It is none of your business .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all live in Australia .
Let &apos;s not forget about what Tom said .
Close your eyes , please .
You have to do that .
What makes you happy makes me happy .
She stayed here by herself .
I &apos;d like you to meet my wife .
Everyone &apos;s saying it .
Were you telling the truth ?
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
So where were you ?
Have you made a decision ?
How much money do you have ?
Tom might get sick .
I never knew Tom could speak French .
I think Tom will listen to me .
Tom knows that he &apos;s right .
It &apos;s simple .
Tom likes being at home .
That &apos;s all you need .
Tom ate alone .
I don &apos;t want to do that , but I have to .
How did you guys first meet each other ?
My brother is eight years older than me .
Have you ever seen this movie before ?
Tom told me that everything was ready .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
This task is too much for me .
Tom got here an hour before Mary .
Tom has many books .
Are you both crazy ?
What languages do you know ?
I don &apos;t want to hear a thing about it .
Tom is now ready to talk .
She has a great interest in music .
Did it actually happen ?
She also speaks French .
We &apos;re not all like that .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
Tom wasn &apos;t here .
I think I know the answer .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
You look like your father .
It &apos;s up to you to make a choice .
We &apos;re from here .
The hotel was once a restaurant .
Tom and I are the same age .
Are you sure about this ?
We &apos;re doing OK .
Tom is home alone .
My French is not good at all .
Did Tom help ?
The TV &apos;s on .
I want you to be here .
I &apos;ve done everything I was supposed to do .
I still haven &apos;t found my keys .
When does he come ?
Tom must &apos;ve told us the truth .
You may not like this book .
You can &apos;t just go .
It &apos;s not like I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom hired Mary .
She &apos;s only a child .
Are you at Tom &apos;s ?
No one listened to me .
I didn &apos;t want that .
You &apos;ve taken a long time eating lunch .
Is that what you &apos;re suggesting ?
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
Do you have everything ?
Give us three minutes .
It was quite funny .
I think it &apos;s fine .
Tom knew that this would happen .
It was a very big room .
I tried to do that .
Did you find anything in the room ?
I was already married at your age .
She wrote a new book .
I want the other one .
May I ask a few questions ?
I think about her a lot .
Tom won &apos;t listen to me .
Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
I might be able to help you .
It &apos;s nearly impossible .
I think about them often .
Let &apos;s sit down on that bench .
Is there anything else we need to do ?
Tom hasn &apos;t come yet .
Tom arrived earlier than I did .
What &apos;s your dad &apos;s name ?
We only want to help you , Tom .
I have to go talk to Tom .
We may as well wait .
They &apos;d like that .
I am ready .
Tom wasn &apos;t funny .
Tom said that he and Mary can &apos;t come to our party .
I thought we were out of coffee .
Are you Tom &apos;s mother ?
I don &apos;t speak French well .
Tom got you in trouble , didn &apos;t he ?
Who did you come with ?
Have you ever seen Tom without his glasses on ?
Tom has a lot of money in the bank .
I can &apos;t leave yet . I still have a few things to do .
Be quick , or you will miss the train .
I am busy .
Please tell me what I &apos;m doing wrong .
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I &apos;ve got a little job for you .
Don &apos;t stop playing .
You like Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I should be at school .
I like walking , especially in the morning .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Nobody wants you to do this .
I can &apos;t stand .
I only have a few hours .
It &apos;s what Tom would want .
This beautiful house is so expensive that we can &apos;t buy it .
Tom is back .
Don &apos;t give me that , Tom .
Tom spoke quickly .
I wanted to say that I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s their right .
I &apos;ll come by .
I only speak French .
Nobody saw Tom .
Can you cook a meal ?
Is this the one you saw ?
That old man caught a large fish .
Please tell me what this is .
That &apos;s what my friends keep telling me .
What were you doing then ?
I want to be able to read French .
I can take you home now .
They came back .
You should have told me about the problem sooner .
There &apos;s a problem I have to talk to you about .
I don &apos;t know the reason why she isn &apos;t coming .
She is kind to him .
We have enough water .
They are the ones who want to go .
Tom spends all his time thinking about Mary .
People change . There &apos;s not much you can do about it .
I &apos;m not going to drink this .
Tom will walk to school tomorrow .
I only have one thing left to do .
I knew you &apos;d understand .
Tom has such beautiful eyes .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom &apos;s around at the moment .
Why are we doing that ?
We probably don &apos;t have enough time to finish doing that today .
He thought that I was very tired .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
How do you know there isn &apos;t one ?
He ran into the room .
I just wanted to see if I could do that .
She visited him once a year .
I told you never to call me here .
Who would buy it ?
Who did you talk with ?
We always want what we don &apos;t have .
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
I don &apos;t have any children .
Is that a promise ?
You know where to find me if you need anything .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
How can I just tell Tom without telling everybody else ?
I love you for that .
I seldom walk to work .
He thinks he knows best .
Tom visited Mary yesterday .
What can you tell me about it ?
I &apos;m taking you with me .
Where are you from ?
Can anyone help me ?
I say it all the time .
That may not happen .
I can take the train .
We had some questions .
I tried again and again .
You know who Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom is going to take care of everything .
If you &apos;d just asked me , I would &apos;ve done it .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
You have no right to do this .
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up .
I hope this never happens again .
It is a book .
I &apos;m sorry about your mom .
Give me your shirt .
They want more .
I like coffee better .
I would like to meet you .
When do you need it ?
I give in .
I came here to give you something .
We know where your family lives .
They did it again .
Tom is doing well now .
I didn &apos;t know that he was there .
Why didn &apos;t you come to yesterday &apos;s party ?
I got angry .
Tom was just pretending to be asleep .
I can &apos;t understand you .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here .
What does that have to do with Tom ?
Tom deserves to know .
Tom has a wife .
You never should &apos;ve let Tom go to Boston with Mary .
I want a refund .
It &apos;s been a long week .
I do not want any money .
I will never be your friend .
Take me to your place .
Tom didn &apos;t need to take a taxi . He could have walked .
I was born in the winter .
They need to work tomorrow .
I want you to come to Boston .
No one told me about that .
It &apos;s not about money .
What year is it ?
Tom &apos;s birthday is next Monday .
Please listen to what I have to say .
I &apos;m going to go .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a new car .
He wants to talk to you .
Have you ever stolen anything ?
That belongs to us .
I saw Tom three hours ago .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is busy or not .
They will be very glad .
Let Tom carry it .
How did you like it ?
I don &apos;t like this movie .
There is no telling when they will come .
Your question does not have an answer .
I &apos;d like to buy this computer .
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
It won &apos;t come to that .
I can &apos;t help it .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name ?
Is that your room ?
Perhaps Tom wanted to buy that .
I don &apos;t really know Tom very well .
Where &apos;s my son ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it here .
She took off her coat .
How are you ?
Where does Tom live ?
I can &apos;t let you leave .
Nobody is really sure .
It looks easy when you do it .
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
Tom stole money from his friends .
I am a boy .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to read this if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I am not sure .
I don &apos;t believe it .
You aren &apos;t going to walk , are you ?
Tom asked Mary what kind of food she liked to eat .
We are home .
What kind of car does Tom drive ?
Tom really speaks French well .
We have a lot of work to do today .
I stopped asking questions .
Tom ran out of the room .
Did Tom tell you ?
They won &apos;t find you .
Your question is hard to answer .
I can &apos;t think of life without you .
He took back everything he said .
I &apos;m sorry for what I did .
Tom barely said a word .
Tom is likely to be right .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as his brother .
Tom wants to know the truth .
How can you still be hungry ?
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
Tom will never know it was you who told me .
Tom is very interested in French .
You &apos;re not telling the truth .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
Why did this happen ?
I think it &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t ask Tom to wait for me .
I thought you &apos;d want this one .
Tom didn &apos;t mind living by himself .
I &apos;ll let Tom know you called .
Tom does know that .
Tom and Mary must really like each other .
We are good friends .
Please tell Tom that Mary called .
I think Tom is thirty years old .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
In case it rains , I won &apos;t go .
I &apos;ve bought a gift for Tom .
Suit yourself .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
It doesn &apos;t matter when you come .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
Tom is able to play the guitar .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of death .
This has nothing to do with what happened here last week .
Could you leave us alone ?
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
Tom started doing that a week ago .
My family is very important to me .
Tom gave me his word .
This restaurant has been here a long time .
I told the police everything I know .
He likes to talk of love .
This bicycle is old , but it &apos;s better than nothing .
The boy playing the guitar is my brother .
Please let me go home .
My sister is three years older than I am .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
The week is finally over .
Can I use your telephone ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
This book is interesting .
Tom is not my son .
Most of the dogs are alive .
Tom loves that .
Tom got in his car and drove away .
I was too happy to sleep .
This song is easy to learn .
When did he arrive here ?
We expect Tom to come back soon .
Do they live with you ?
Please give me another chance .
He was not quick enough .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
She seems to be sick .
Which do you prefer , tea or coffee ?
I didn &apos;t see you coming .
I go to the restaurant every 2 days .
I &apos;ve been there before .
That was different .
Don &apos;t give it to anyone .
Is this your book ?
You have everything .
I can &apos;t show you this .
It is not his business .
Why don &apos;t you go home now ?
They were in that room with me all night .
Tom is tempted .
She has many friends .
I &apos;m so happy for you both .
She gave me her phone number .
Can you tell me how to get to the airport ?
Tom had many friends .
My money was stolen .
Did you speak to Tom about this ?
Who am I ?
Does Tom make you happy ?
Dogs can swim .
I don &apos;t come here very often .
If he has time , he will come .
We were just friends .
I &apos;m going to have to go home early today .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary in weeks .
All of us are disappointed .
Tom asked a few questions that Mary didn &apos;t want to answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is at home .
Tom would never do anything like that .
Tom wants to be in Boston .
The whole country is talking about it .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know where Mary is going .
Give him plenty of work to do .
You &apos;ve often said so yourself .
Tom wants it .
I think you know what to do .
What did Tom have in his pocket ?
I know you were in Boston last summer .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will think .
Can you really swim ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming home .
I wasn &apos;t in time for school this morning .
I no longer need to work .
It is no use trying to solve this problem .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
Who are all these people ?
No one wants that .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
You may ask any questions you want .
We didn &apos;t find Tom .
This is a picture of my mother .
I just finished reading the book .
When does Tom have to do that ?
That woman &apos;s name is Mary .
Tom worked very hard today .
Tom is definitely able to do that .
She will have to cook for everyone .
Have you ever heard of him ?
Look at that picture .
No one believed me .
Everything &apos;s gone .
I &apos;m not a baby .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
People often tell me more than I want to know .
What did you say yesterday ?
It is no use trying again .
I got up early yesterday .
Tom wore glasses .
Tom spoke very loudly .
He looks old for his age .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s home .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all like dancing .
Let me know what time you want me there .
When was the last time you played tennis with Tom ?
I should &apos;ve done that sooner .
There were only six people at the party .
Where is your money ?
I &apos;ve read a lot of books .
Turn to me for help if you are in difficulty .
Tom made me carry his suitcase .
I don &apos;t have to be here .
You did so much better this time .
You should listen to him .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
That has nothing to do with me .
It &apos;s every man for himself .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
I let you down .
That isn &apos;t my fault .
Tom told me Mary died on Monday .
I told Tom to do that .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thought .
I didn &apos;t buy anything for Tom .
I cannot read without glasses .
We were very busy last week .
Tom can &apos;t remember .
We can &apos;t go right now .
Tom seems quite happy .
I go to bed very early .
She began to sing .
I want one , too .
May I ask why it is that you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
Did you ever call Tom ?
It &apos;s all over for us .
Please feel free to ask me any question .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t remember anything .
Tom is almost never late .
What happened to him ?
Tom has trouble hearing .
It isn &apos;t funny anymore .
Tom had a son .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
It was a long time since I &apos;ve done that .
She can &apos;t be over thirty .
I &apos;m interested in music .
I didn &apos;t even know you had a boyfriend .
What are they doing out here ?
He gave me a watch .
I can speak French a little .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;d better go home .
Tom tried to talk to us in French .
Tom is not to blame .
I forgot to buy a gift for you .
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
I don &apos;t want to live this way .
You &apos;ll get one .
I want to be a teacher when I grow up .
How did you and Tom meet ?
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
Tom had a good opinion of Mary .
Can we have a moment alone ?
My birthday is one month from today .
Tom is feeling nauseous .
Her father died .
Are you from the bank ?
I know exactly where you are .
The price of meat dropped .
I really like you .
We &apos;re not sure if she &apos;s right .
We know what happened to Tom &apos;s car .
Can &apos;t this wait until tomorrow ?
Tom is lying on the bench .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s already time to go home .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
Tell me what really happened .
Tom sometimes wears a hat .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
You &apos;re going to love Boston .
I &apos;ll write to you or I &apos;ll phone you next week .
Tom has a plan .
I am positive that he is wrong .
I &apos;d love to see you .
The food disagreed with him .
How long does it take to the train station by taxi ?
Tom has finally arrived .
Tom has come home .
I won &apos;t make that mistake again .
Tell us what to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like anybody here .
Tom never tells us anything .
Tom says he &apos;s OK .
Do you want to meet up after work ?
Mary died three hours after her husband .
I only need two more minutes .
I &apos;m going to have to run .
I wish that I could help .
I gave my sister a dictionary .
Tom will take it .
Do you really want to have children ?
How could Tom possibly win ?
I speak French .
I found you .
Why are you pretending you don &apos;t know me ?
Don &apos;t be disappointed .
I should &apos;ve known it was you .
Tom took a few things out of his suitcase .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom is a good father .
I &apos;m going to kill myself .
Tom wanted to write something .
Tom is also from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll tell you what I want you to do .
Where do you live ?
Tom is telling a story .
What is it you &apos;d like me to do exactly ?
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
Who told Tom that ?
Tom needs our help .
Tom wants more .
It &apos;s not a secret that Tom &apos;s opinion is different than yours .
There &apos;s only room for one of us .
I knew something Tom didn &apos;t know .
This one &apos;s no good .
I want to marry her .
What &apos;s up with you and Tom ?
The sun is shining .
It &apos;s very dangerous to swim in this river .
My headache has gone .
There &apos;s not much to say .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
We should &apos;ve stayed till the end of the party .
We &apos;ll begin work soon .
What is she like ?
Your coat is very beautiful .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want me to drive you home ?
Why did you do what you did ?
Shall I help you ?
I &apos;m sorry . I forgot about this .
The girls were not afraid , but the boys were .
I just want to sleep .
I don &apos;t think that Tom has a dog .
We will leave in an hour .
I &apos;ll stay until tomorrow .
His girlfriend did it for him .
It &apos;s cold .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time .
You can &apos;t stay here .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
I &apos;m not doing this for me .
How are your parents ?
I &apos;m sleepy !
I could eat a horse .
You can wait for me here .
I think that he wants to buy a new dictionary .
No one knows where he lives .
Tom hurt me .
Tom seems to be a good guitarist .
Isn &apos;t that your car , Tom ?
What time is your train ?
Do you think anyone can see us ?
We don &apos;t need your money .
Do you think Tom likes Mary ?
You should &apos;ve known better .
I think Tom said he was from Boston .
This isn &apos;t about me or Tom .
They &apos;re quiet .
I think that would be good .
What are you planning to do ?
It &apos;ll be a big day .
Tom really pays attention to people .
You can take your time .
All of us know him well .
Do you have a car ?
Tom came here for the money .
I &apos;m happy where I am .
Why were you there ?
We have no school tomorrow .
I want you to come to Boston .
It doesn &apos;t always happen .
You might change your mind in a couple of weeks .
Is this our hotel ?
That &apos;s what we &apos;d like to do .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
Tom hasn &apos;t finished his homework yet .
Did Tom call you ?
I can &apos;t see a way out of this .
Why did Tom want to learn French ?
I &apos;m going to Boston .
I &apos;m happy about that .
I was very rich until I met her .
I love you more than anything .
It was white .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
Did you say something ?
Tom and I work together .
What &apos;s your opinion on that ?
Tom is like family .
I &apos;m about ready .
This is Japan .
I don &apos;t recall asking for your advice .
I can &apos;t say exactly what the problem is .
Tom has issues .
I can &apos;t even remember what his name was .
Tom is my older brother .
I haven &apos;t been busy since yesterday .
Who gave this to you ?
Why is this my job ?
Tom and Mary are eating lunch .
I love your car .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
I didn &apos;t go .
I started working .
I saw Tom with Mary .
I didn &apos;t go .
They aren &apos;t that good .
We can win this war .
Everybody knows .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you here .
What kind of things do you enjoy doing ?
I found you .
Can you tell me a little about yourself ?
I believe I can help with that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live here anymore .
I &apos;m not married to Tom anymore .
Tom has big hands .
I thought Tom had enough money to live on .
Have you really talked to Tom ?
Tom asked me to ask you something .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
Tom is quite busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Have you ever taken your children to the beach ?
What made you do this ?
I think Tom isn &apos;t home .
This is what I have to do .
Just please be careful .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I &apos;d like some privacy .
Do you know if Tom can speak French ?
I want you to go there with Tom .
I can &apos;t explain what I don &apos;t understand .
We love coffee .
Can you play guitar ?
The matter is of great importance to me .
Did Tom like it in Boston ?
Tom said he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
I know it isn &apos;t always easy .
Tom has more questions .
Can you buy one for me as well ?
Do you want this or don &apos;t you ?
Where is he playing ?
I don &apos;t want to do that again .
We have lots and lots of time .
I know where Tom lived .
This is a good dictionary .
That &apos;s what I want to understand .
My family is not very large .
I look forward to reading your report .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .
I don &apos;t know why he said that to me .
Tom isn &apos;t up yet .
May I dance with you ?
I can &apos;t leave my family .
Do your parents know that you &apos;re here ?
Tom is still in love with you , I think .
Tom spoke .
It wasn &apos;t supposed to be this way .
I &apos;ve already tried doing that three times .
What will happen will happen .
Tom looks furious .
This belongs to Tom .
I don &apos;t deserve this .
Please have someone else do it .
Tom wants to go with us .
What is the name of this river ?
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do it .
I can &apos;t help it .
You have my word on it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to do that .
That is just her way .
We &apos;ve got to make a choice .
Let &apos;s not study French today .
It &apos;s not what you say that counts , but how you say it .
My parents don &apos;t know where I am .
I went to the hospital to see my wife .
I was furious .
This camera is very expensive .
Tom wants to ask you why you weren &apos;t at the meeting last week .
Did you ever try ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have an office .
They were all surprised to see me there .
I don &apos;t know whether I will have time to do it .
We &apos;ve got a long night ahead of us .
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
May I ask you to help me with something ?
Tom will likely be right .
How was your summer ?
I don &apos;t like your girlfriend .
I don &apos;t know if I want to marry Tom .
What else did you expect ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m better than Tom .
They love that .
Is this what you &apos;ve been searching for all this time ?
What did Tom want us to do ?
I had no idea where I was .
I hope to hear from you soon .
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
Why are you at home ?
Tom told Mary what John wanted .
No one will believe me .
Where &apos;s my beer ?
I like milk .
There &apos;s no water .
You cannot do all these things at once .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
I know that Tom hurt you .
He is likely to come .
No one knew what to do .
Tell me what it was like .
She took a walk in the park .
I can &apos;t read your mind .
&quot; Why did Tom do that ? &quot; &quot; Do what ? &quot;
You know what this is , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m very happy here .
Nobody &apos;s going to die .
I just wanted you to know that .
You must be back by 10 o &apos;clock .
I lost face .
That wasn &apos;t your fault .
I don &apos;t do those things .
Tom ate alone .
Why didn &apos;t you come ?
I &apos;m no longer angry at you .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
Tom lives at home with his mom .
&quot; Please give me some water . &quot; &quot; All right . &quot;
They know me .
I &apos;m glad I was nearby .
Tom works at home .
She showed me her new car .
Why don &apos;t you come ?
She is out now .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
We &apos;re supposed to try to solve our problems by ourselves .
You really know your stuff , Tom .
I have a lot to do .
I can &apos;t talk now .
That &apos;d be dangerous .
I don &apos;t know when we &apos;re supposed to be there .
How &apos;s Tom going to find Mary ?
He &apos;s the man that was here last week .
I don &apos;t understand much about it .
Tom is scared , but Mary isn &apos;t .
I need to be sure that you understand this .
You know where to find me if you want to talk .
Tom spent three weeks in the hospital .
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
I continued reading .
They married when they were young .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
Where will you be ?
Tom went to the theater with Mary .
The story was true .
Come on , let &apos;s take shelter .
Tom &apos;s watching .
What school did you go to ?
That was never an issue .
I &apos;m not going to explain it to you again .
Tom can speak a little French .
Thanks for dropping by .
Don &apos;t you like your job anymore ?
Tom has been like a father to me .
As usual , Tom was late .
I do like Tom .
I &apos;d like you to do it , too .
He has too many books .
You were both drunk .
Tom stayed behind to help Mary .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
I don &apos;t want to be late today .
Tom won &apos;t know the answer to that .
He took her by the hand .
I don &apos;t find this amusing .
I may do that .
It &apos;s common knowledge that you don &apos;t like Tom .
He is sure to win .
Have you heard about the accident ?
The car is ready .
I need some time alone .
I can &apos;t swim at all .
I want to go with you , Tom .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
I can &apos;t eat .
I won &apos;t need you .
Did you say something ?
I come from America .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car .
Can I see you tonight ?
Are you sure , Tom ?
Did you eat too much ?
I can &apos;t even remember what his name was .
What do you like to eat ?
It &apos;s too difficult to explain .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
What &apos;s your decision ?
I would do it if I could .
Tom &apos;s happy not to be in your shoes .
I can &apos;t remember how to go there .
It seems that something has happened .
None of my friends know .
They can &apos;t see Tom .
The door won &apos;t close .
It is difficult for me to understand him .
That &apos;ll be nice .
I don &apos;t have any books to read .
I &apos;ve done it before .
I have enough money to buy this book .
What he did was wrong .
What does this look like ?
I have something to show you .
This makes her angry .
You should tell the truth .
The days are growing longer .
I need to get back home now .
It &apos;s difficult to understand his ideas .
Tom and Mary want us to do that .
When &apos;s your birthday ?
Somebody &apos;s at the door .
Tom will be at home tomorrow .
Tell Tom the truth .
Tom listens to me .
He had plenty of money for his trip .
It &apos;s not funny anymore .
All the students were there .
You know I have to go .
Where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
Tom made his parents happy .
I don &apos;t consider Tom a great man .
It &apos;s still true today .
Tom stayed calm .
Why do you think I &apos;m thinking about you ?
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
Tom isn &apos;t scared .
It &apos;s just one of those things .
I hate them .
Who is the man who was talking with you ?
I like your idea .
When was the last time you lost your keys ?
We all die sooner or later .
They know who you are .
It was quite funny .
She is a good English speaker .
We should do this every day .
Why are you not satisfied ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Have you ever heard her play the piano ?
Don &apos;t say that word ever again .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
He arrived in time .
I am able to read English .
What do you think about it ?
Where is my office ?
They &apos;ll find us .
May I do it right now ?
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
You didn &apos;t have to come so early .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
We know you have it .
He has no objection to our leaving .
Are you two busy right now ?
Tom and Mary are both good teachers .
I hope Tom says yes .
He went home yesterday .
What did I do wrong ?
What was that ?
My father takes a walk every day .
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
This shirt is too small for me to wear .
Would you like to study abroad ?
Tom thinks it &apos;ll be fine .
He slept an hour .
I was born there .
Tom sometimes wears a hat .
Tom is now on vacation , isn &apos;t he ?
Not everybody knows about the plan .
He lost sight of his friend in the crowd .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet .
Tom never keeps his word .
I &apos;ve received another message from Tom .
I &apos;m often here .
I would do it again .
Tom is at school now .
The man and the woman are eating outdoors .
Did Tom say who did it ?
I had a good night &apos;s sleep .
I wish today were Monday .
They are very big .
I don &apos;t need you to remind me of anything . I know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
We should &apos;ve done that earlier .
This is all on me .
Look what I made for Tom .
Everybody likes you .
What have you come here for ?
I need you to help me .
Where did you buy flowers ?
Who gave you this watch ?
The dog is sleeping .
I won &apos;t go there anymore .
That was not my question .
He abandoned his family .
Lend us a hand .
Are you my doctor ?
You haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
Mary told me that she didn &apos;t love her husband anymore .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I don &apos;t want kids .
That &apos;s serious .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t need to .
She &apos;s eight years old .
All we want is for you to be happy .
Let &apos;s meet in front of the library .
I will tell him about it when he comes next time .
He loves her , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
Tom may not be doing that .
Why does Tom think I &apos;m here ?
Help yourself to a piece of cake .
I know where she lives .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s all true .
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
When is Tom coming ?
What does Tom have on ?
I &apos;ve already read this book .
We &apos;ll do everything we can .
I think Tom isn &apos;t right .
What did you make ?
It &apos;s already too late .
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
His family did not have much money .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough time to eat lunch .
I told Mary that I loved her .
I have no intention of asking him .
Tom has been unwell .
We can &apos;t leave yet . We need to wait for Tom .
There was nobody in the garden .
He didn &apos;t have enough money to ride home on the train .
We &apos;re afraid .
What time is it now by your watch ?
You &apos;re still young .
How come he didn &apos;t show up ?
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
I &apos;m coming with you .
You never come over anymore .
Come here .
You can &apos;t tell me what to do .
Tom seemed happy .
Tom pointed to Mary .
We &apos;re busy , Tom .
I can do that if you let me .
Whatever it is , I didn &apos;t do it .
It is said that he is sick .
No one knows what has become of her .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want coffee ?
I couldn &apos;t find a cab last night .
It &apos;s a little difficult for me .
You &apos;d better go . It &apos;s getting late .
Why didn &apos;t you think of that before ?
It looks like Tom is feeling much better today .
Tom knows you &apos;re the one that started this .
I had no choice but to stay .
What was Tom &apos;s answer ?
The company cancelled the meeting .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
What are you implying ?
What &apos;ll Tom win ?
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom is helping out in the kitchen .
Tom doesn &apos;t like fish .
Tom gave Mary the money .
This letter &apos;s for me .
Tom was waiting to see what would happen .
You work too much .
Tom asked too many questions .
I just wanted to let you know I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
Tom is our friend .
I have just finished my work .
Hand it to Tom .
Please think it over .
Tom passed away last night .
She &apos;s a lot better today .
That &apos;s true as well .
That &apos;s what I told them .
I remember having done that somewhere .
I just don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s happened .
Tom has never done anything like this before .
I really hope you &apos;re kidding .
Tom said it was none of my business .
He wore old shoes .
Have you heard this story already ?
You can &apos;t change Tom .
They were abandoned by their mother .
I &apos;ll make you happy no matter what happens .
Here &apos;s what I think .
Watch what you &apos;re doing .
You &apos;ve got no right to talk to Tom that way .
We &apos;ve been together for three years .
It often rains here .
Why are they doing this ?
Tom speaks very good French .
I &apos;m doing okay .
Tom saw the bus .
This is incorrect .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
Take as much as you want .
Life is hard .
Do you want to see it again ?
The teacher was disappointed at my answer .
I think Tom is afraid of you .
I &apos;m with my family right now .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;ll do all we can .
I &apos;d like to talk with you in private .
Tom bought a dog .
Tom ran into the room .
He was sitting on a bench .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t worry .
If he makes that face it &apos;s because he &apos;s nervous .
Maybe it never happened .
I found some money .
Tom and Mary have a daughter named Alice .
What do you say we go to my house ?
Who wrote this book ?
We &apos;ll meet again .
Where did you meet your boyfriend ?
Tom wants to learn how to play guitar .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is in Boston .
I &apos;ve located Tom .
I have one .
Tom doesn &apos;t like kids .
Anybody can make a mistake .
You &apos;ve got to help me .
What are Tom &apos;s true intentions ?
I &apos;ve seen the picture before .
You &apos;re my girlfriend .
It doesn &apos;t hurt .
Watch it there , Tom .
He arrived at the station .
Tom took Mary to the hospital .
We don &apos;t study French .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ?
That may easily have been a mistake .
What does that have to do with me ?
We &apos;re finished here .
Who &apos;s talking ?
I think Tom is dangerous .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that .
I &apos;m a lot taller than Tom .
It wasn &apos;t funny .
You &apos;re scaring me .
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
We &apos;ll see you when you get home .
He often goes with her to watch movies .
This is going to be good .
I thought he was my brother .
I became angry .
Aren &apos;t you feeling well ?
If you want to talk , let &apos;s talk .
He isn &apos;t going to buy a camera .
It &apos;s been three days .
Tom said you would understand .
Tom slept on the couch .
I &apos;d like to get some sleep .
I have to do my homework .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait long .
I prefer fish to meat .
You can sit next to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t struggle like this .
There &apos;s no coffee .
What are you going to do next Sunday ?
You don &apos;t look well .
What do you expect me to do ?
I don &apos;t know where you work .
I &apos;m in love with Mary .
The nurse will tell you how to do it .
Tom left a note on the table for Mary .
He &apos;s feeling much better .
I heard that Tom is going to play tennis with us this afternoon .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
Tom enjoys playing the piano .
I &apos;ll show you what I can do .
He is not so tall .
Tom says he &apos;s not going .
You can answer it .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom thinks I &apos;m in love with Mary .
I &apos;ll stay at my sister &apos;s place .
Are you able to swim ?
Tom is good at it .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t believe me .
Nobody has ever spoken French to me .
I cannot afford to pay so much .
I don &apos;t like this hat .
It &apos;s hard to get people to change .
She pretended that she was sick .
What choice did I have ?
Let it be .
You must see a doctor .
I didn &apos;t hear you coming .
I heard the good news .
I asked Tom what was wrong .
He told me to meet him there .
I know it &apos;s in the apartment , but I can &apos;t find it .
You went to the park yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Did Tom say why he was here ?
I think I know why you &apos;re here .
They aren &apos;t my books .
I don &apos;t want to talk about my family .
I was in bed all day long yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be with us .
Mary is still living at home with her parents .
Tom and Mary are still working .
I know that this is important .
I think I know what it is .
I never had a girlfriend before .
He died yesterday .
I know I love you .
Don &apos;t smoke here .
Where &apos;s Tom from ?
Tom has already made up his mind .
I like what I do .
I want to know what you know .
He loves music .
Tom bought a new car yesterday .
Tom left .
My mom bought me this shirt .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
You must do the work even if you don &apos;t like it .
Tom used to play the guitar .
Only six people came to the party .
I have an exam tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t start to study French until he was thirty .
We worry about your future .
They had only one child .
Why are you doing this to yourself ?
Can I see that one ?
Tom almost told Mary that he loved her .
You never can tell what &apos;ll happen in the future .
When have you ever done anything for me ?
I didn &apos;t hear a word Tom said .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand .
The little boy grew very fast .
Tom , why would anybody be looking for you ?
How did you know my name ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know anyone here .
We don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
I am your friend , right ?
How do you like your new apartment ?
Tom finished the work by himself .
Tom hasn &apos;t played the piano in years .
They &apos;re afraid of Tom .
I &apos;ve got no worries .
Tom loves Mary , but she doesn &apos;t love him .
A day without you is like a summer without the sun .
We were just talking about you .
Mary was Tom &apos;s first girlfriend .
Tom told me that he won &apos;t tell Mary what happened .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
How is it going with you and Tom ?
Tom said he wanted to go swimming with us .
I know what you &apos;re after .
I don &apos;t know anything about Boston .
No one is listening to Tom .
It &apos;s been tried .
Our principal made a long speech .
What did Tom tell Mary about John ?
We &apos;re not doing that .
What time do you think Tom will be back ?
Who goes there ?
I like him .
I have no problem with this .
I wish I &apos;d kept up my French .
I hope Tom comes .
Tom says he &apos;s planning to go to Boston this winter .
We worry about your future .
Tom didn &apos;t come back .
Where were you the entire afternoon ?
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I want to stay home and read a book .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
We &apos;re in Australia now .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
Tom said that he had been busy .
I &apos;ve learned to think like Tom thinks .
That &apos;s not how we think .
That was the last time any of us ever saw Tom .
He arrived rather late .
Why does love make us so happy ?
I think I &apos;m just tired .
I don &apos;t want to stop working .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
I &apos;d like to leave early .
You can tell me the truth .
People should love one another .
Tom just might get better .
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy .
I think you know what I mean .
We &apos;ve got to stop meeting like this .
English is not easy , but it is interesting .
Tom got drunk .
I want the other one .
Tom is too young to go there by himself .
That &apos;s not what you said last night .
Tom wanted to get back to the office .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Tom said that Mary may do that .
Let &apos;s get together again !
What I need is more time .
He put the book on the desk .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
How did you like that movie ?
I &apos;d like Tom to take me home .
She said that she was ill .
It &apos;s all very new to me .
I &apos;ve found something I &apos;d like to show you .
Tom asked me to give you something .
I think I see the problem .
Tom &apos;ll succeed .
That &apos;s my dictionary .
Tom wanted it .
Let &apos;s go straight to the beach .
Tom left his keys in the car .
You don &apos;t care about me .
My father is a teacher .
Tom asked me for a glass of water .
Tom doesn &apos;t want our help .
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
Whatever I do , she says I can do better .
I hope you aren &apos;t too disappointed .
He wanted to succeed .
This is very important .
You &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
Tom wanted to know everything about me .
I felt hungry .
I have been busy today .
Where is the nearest store ?
Let me see how I feel tomorrow .
Where &apos;s the bank ?
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s wrong .
My car is on its last legs .
I don &apos;t care what Tom does .
You can &apos;t be everyone &apos;s friend all the time .
This is the best camera in the store .
Does Tom have one ?
I don &apos;t see why we need to do this .
I haven &apos;t asked anyone yet .
Is it for me ?
Tom thinks he understands women .
Tom hadn &apos;t expected that .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Don &apos;t you want to know where I was ?
Tom isn &apos;t certain about the answer .
This one is ours .
I can do this alone .
How did you know my name ?
I want to go to school in Australia .
I don &apos;t like my school .
We know why .
We know where your family lives .
I &apos;m in love with her .
Please don &apos;t bother .
It &apos;s better that way .
I &apos;ve got a little job for you .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
I can &apos;t read this .
I want this phone .
I know you &apos;re not like Tom .
We meet once a month .
You remind me of my mother .
That &apos;s not quite right .
When &apos;s Tom coming home ?
That &apos;s not going to help .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me .
Tom called again .
I have a lot of friends in Boston .
There are more women than men in the world .
This piece is impossible to play .
My father is in his room .
I think Tom is happy .
I &apos;m right .
She was able to solve the problem in ten minutes .
He can do whatever he likes with the money .
What do you guys think of Tom ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been very well recently .
The message was in French .
It will be raining at this time tomorrow .
Do what you like .
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
Tomorrow is her birthday .
Why do I have to go ?
Have you finished what you were doing ?
Everybody was tired .
I &apos;m not as old as Tom thinks I am .
You aren &apos;t likely to find that word in a dictionary that &apos;s this small .
We don &apos;t get on well with each other .
Please sit down .
I can &apos;t leave now .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tonight .
We &apos;re here for you .
They &apos;ve still got Tom .
He &apos;s done this before .
I don &apos;t often eat out with my family .
Can you stand ?
I make lunch every day .
I had no difficulty finding your house .
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
They found this .
Tom is really handsome .
I &apos;d like to help you .
We went to Boston last year for the first time .
We have nothing .
She is looked up to by her friends .
I can &apos;t go back to that house .
How did you come up with that answer ?
Don &apos;t speak unless you have something worth saying .
Do you want to go with Tom ?
I should visit Tom .
We have one for you , too .
You do understand me , don &apos;t you ?
That was Tom &apos;s fault .
Tom is at home .
They make a great team .
If only it would stop raining !
He died doing what he loved .
I cannot read without glasses .
This water is good to drink .
My brother is still sleeping .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
How are you coming ?
His story must be true .
I don &apos;t love her anymore .
It &apos;s been five years since my father died .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me you were here .
It &apos;s no use .
I &apos;m almost sure .
My uncle died a year ago .
I had no idea what to do .
I did that right away .
This is the very book that I want to read .
Who talked ?
I think that would be fine .
I need this back by tomorrow .
Tom knows something Mary doesn &apos;t .
We lost it .
I wrote this song just for you .
Tom may do that for you .
I &apos;m for that .
How far is it from your house to town ?
Tom never talks about his family .
It &apos;s a situation I would love to change .
That &apos;s what we do best .
I hate this school .
What are you guys planning ?
Tom said that he was too busy to help Mary do that .
I heard that , but I didn &apos;t know it was true .
I have a sister and a brother .
I like being with you .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a man .
You have a beautiful sister .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Tom stopped everything .
What do they look like ?
It &apos;s easy to answer your question .
I think I &apos;m going to go now .
Where did Tom see you ?
I said get up !
Tom has lots of money .
I &apos;ve been silent for a long time .
Tom gave me another chance .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
He hadn &apos;t eaten in two days .
Do you remember what you said to me ?
Did you see Tom in the park ?
Tom still can &apos;t understand French .
Tom ate dinner .
I may never walk again .
I &apos;m not to blame .
There are still a lot of things to do .
It &apos;s not true anymore .
Tom wondered how long he &apos;d have to wait for Mary .
You were supposed to be helping Tom , you know .
Tom likes it in Boston .
She pretended to know nothing about it .
You &apos;re a woman .
Tom has two cats .
Do you do this every day ?
We were all tired .
It just doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom and I are scared .
I want to go to Boston with you .
Are you angry at me ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to go with us .
I won &apos;t say anything .
Tom told me that I should &apos;ve said yes .
I &apos;m here to take you home .
I already feel better .
Everything depends on what you will do .
Tom and I want to get married .
I know her by name .
I must go now .
I &apos;m happy with what I have .
Tom is nothing but a child .
Please give me some water .
I went swimming in the river yesterday .
I have a car .
Do you still want me to give Tom your old computer ?
He didn &apos;t show up at the breakfast .
He wouldn &apos;t listen to my advice .
I &apos;m always surprised by him .
I know almost nothing about you .
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
Tom didn &apos;t really seem surprised .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
You &apos;re so beautiful !
Tom drove Mary &apos;s car to Boston .
I really like this song .
I wonder what it would be like to be rich .
I saw her home .
Are you hot ?
I can &apos;t let Tom see me like this .
I don &apos;t care what you think .
We did all we could .
Are you still busy ?
I &apos;d love to dance with you .
Give that back to me .
Tom comes to Boston once a year .
What do they want with Tom ?
We have to buy them from abroad .
I don &apos;t know if Tom works there or not .
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
He came to ask us to help him .
Tom arrived on Monday .
This door would not open .
They &apos;ll look after me .
She wants to work in a hospital .
I don &apos;t want to stay here .
I &apos;ve forgotten his name .
I don &apos;t see anything .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you really want me to tell Tom about you and Mary ?
Tom and Mary told John .
I &apos;ll be OK .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three days .
We must not forget our promise .
Don &apos;t let anyone else tell you otherwise .
You have everything .
The time will come when you will know the truth .
Tom was always different .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk .
Tom and Mary both walked .
Tom arrived half an hour early .
They &apos;re family .
A great future lies before her .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a sister .
We got to the station at six .
Do you have a minute ?
Fire is very dangerous .
I remember .
He can drive a car .
I &apos;m going to be there .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
I can do it myself .
He doesn &apos;t speak my language .
You &apos;re like me .
Why didn &apos;t Tom stop ?
She wasn &apos;t able to contact him by phone .
I kept my word .
You must really be proud of yourself .
I want one like that .
Tom wanted to do everything himself .
You &apos;re always so worried about what other people think .
I know what we need to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t find this as funny as Mary does .
The light was on .
She is going to learn how to drive .
We know what we have to do .
They &apos;re pretty loud .
Tom intended to tell Mary everything .
I had to work on Sunday .
I have simply nothing to say about it .
I &apos;m very sorry about Tom .
Now she understands what I mean .
Can you still remember when we first met ?
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
What have I missed now ?
It kept raining all day long .
Tom comes to school by car .
I &apos;m not like Tom .
I &apos;m so happy you could make it .
I hit on a good idea .
Tom will come soon .
Tom is going to do that for us .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Who did you go swimming with ?
What else did Tom want ?
She should eat breakfast .
I was alone .
Why are you going to Boston ?
What did you do this morning ?
Nobody tells me anything .
Tell Tom I &apos;d like to talk to him .
You need to stay awake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like that .
I don &apos;t want to have kids , and I don &apos;t want to get married .
We are at school together .
When and where shall we meet ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t think I want to know .
They were sick .
What &apos;s your decision ?
My parents don &apos;t like my girlfriend . They think that she &apos;s not good enough for me .
You are too young to be in love .
Tom wakes up at six-thirty every morning .
Tom isn &apos;t really sure .
You ought to have told me that before .
Tom will be staying with us for the next three weeks .
You look exactly like Tom .
He kept me waiting .
You ought to have apologized to her .
Go back to sleep .
I don &apos;t mind if it &apos;s hot .
Tom is working on it .
You can take a taxi .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
Who &apos;d believe you anyway ?
What are you eating ?
Tom assumed that Mary knew why John was in the hospital .
I don &apos;t feel like watching TV tonight .
You have to answer the question .
I &apos;m very worried about your health .
I &apos;d like to see what Tom has .
Tom said that he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
How about tomorrow night ?
He does nothing but read books all day long .
How could that happen ?
Do you know how old I am ?
Thank you for seeing me .
Give me the book .
She was ill for a long time .
They &apos;re drunk .
Give me a day .
Can your wife speak French ?
I have a lot of work to do today .
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
I &apos;ve got to speak to Tom .
He &apos;s very kind to me .
I have a few friends .
Who is there ?
It &apos;s no use asking me for money .
He is getting old .
I &apos;ve already been here two hours .
What happens now ?
You were pretending , weren &apos;t you ?
I have a lot of books .
I want that book .
That school looks just like a prison .
She &apos;s pleased with her new dress .
That one &apos;s for me , too .
Tom is not happy about this .
It &apos;s hard to say .
I &apos;ll give you five minutes to work out this problem .
My book has to be somewhere in the room .
I have to be home for dinner .
When did you get to London ?
They know where Tom is .
You aren &apos;t going to tell my parents , are you ?
I got it for next to nothing .
Tom appears OK .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why he &apos;s here .
Let him pay for it .
You are better than me .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
This is what I &apos;m good at .
I don &apos;t understand you .
She handed him a book .
He is very fond of music .
Is my answer correct ?
She cried for help , but nobody heard her .
Are you happy now ?
I &apos;d like to know where Tom lives .
Tom is going to Boston on Monday .
It &apos;s not a game .
Tom came on his own .
Tom is not happy .
We &apos;re not going to talk to Tom .
I &apos;ve eaten enough .
Please sit down .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase open .
When are you going to work ?
You &apos;re going to want to see this .
It &apos;s for me .
Tom can &apos;t afford anything .
Did Tom forget to pay ?
We went to the beach .
I don &apos;t want Tom seeing this .
I can &apos;t talk about that right now .
Do you have something that you want to say to me ?
That happens all the time .
It isn &apos;t what I thought .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to be here .
I &apos;m hungry now .
This book is hard for me to read .
That &apos;s water under the bridge .
Tom says he wants to leave the country .
Tom and I enjoy swimming together .
Tom likes wine .
Anyone can do it easily .
Who &apos;s coming ?
She got up late .
The baby can stand but can &apos;t walk .
You &apos;re not welcome here .
I don &apos;t like Tom that much .
Aren &apos;t you tired ?
Tom is quite funny .
I understand what you &apos;re saying .
Did Tom find it ?
We &apos;re losing .
I can &apos;t wait all day .
All you need to do is wait .
What do you say ?
Tom seems to be tired .
I am content with my job .
Tom has a lot of work to do .
Tom was looking quite happy .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s .
It hurts here .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that , is he ?
Tom likes that one .
Just get to work .
Do as you please .
I &apos;ve known Tom for a long time .
We can do it right now .
Most women think like that .
Is that all you want to know ?
Where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
People don &apos;t always tell the truth .
This table is just as large as ours .
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
There is one apple on the desk .
Tom can cook .
I &apos;m not sure who wrote this report .
I wouldn &apos;t want to keep Tom waiting .
Tom is not happy about it .
Tom already did that .
I take it you like Tom .
His mother was right .
Who knows what you saw ?
He left the house at eight o &apos;clock .
Tom has been abroad for three years .
Tom stood quickly .
Tom came .
He looks good for his age .
What you &apos;re saying is true .
We should go to the party together .
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party .
How long have you been in here ?
I want some money .
Tom is the one who told me who to give it to .
You have time .
Tell me everything you know .
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
He will be in time for the train .
It looks almost new .
I can &apos;t pay you . Are you still willing to help ?
I wanted Tom to do that .
We &apos;ll all die .
What do you want to do with it ?
Let me introduce you to him .
I don &apos;t want Tom here .
I received your message yesterday .
I &apos;ll take your suitcase to your room .
It &apos;s almost over .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s on Monday .
I &apos;m thirty .
Tom asked Mary why she &apos;d done that .
The students like it .
He got up early so he &apos;d be in time for the train .
I told Tom that I was busy .
It &apos;s impossible to fix .
There was much work to do .
Tom says he &apos;s disappointed .
Was Tom here today ?
There she comes .
Have you ever met Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
He has a good understanding of the problems .
She lives in the country .
She told me she knew my brother .
She met him on the beach .
Are you scared of me ?
I &apos;ve never been to that town .
Why don &apos;t I go ?
Tom understands French fairly well .
I didn &apos;t see you at Tom &apos;s party last night .
It &apos;s getting cold .
I &apos;ve seen things .
Tom went away .
What did you expect me to say ?
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary would be there .
Tom is not on good terms with his family .
I wonder if Tom has a girlfriend .
Have you told your mom ?
Are you happy where you are ?
What Tom does is his own business .
Tom still has to tell Mary what to do .
Tom took me for my brother .
Tom thinks that &apos;s not a good idea .
We want our money back .
I think Tom knows why Mary isn &apos;t here .
It is clear that we cannot live without air .
Who are these people ?
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
The food &apos;s not ready yet .
You should be proud of yourselves .
We &apos;ll drive .
Tom didn &apos;t say why he was avoiding Mary .
How is it made ?
I think you &apos;ll like this .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
He thought the matter over for three days .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
That remains to be seen .
We &apos;ve got to do that on Monday .
I wonder why Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Tom asked if I &apos;d found my key .
They &apos;ll understand that .
You should go to the doctor .
I made a mistake .
When I was your age , I had a job .
Don &apos;t be nervous .
Tom left five minutes ago .
Tom wants to go by train .
My mother took me to the park .
Please tell the others everything you &apos;ve just told me .
I &apos;m still busy .
I &apos;ll be back .
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened ?
This is wrong .
Your father won &apos;t buy it .
The match was Monday .
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
A man must work .
Why would I say anything ?
Tom seems lucky .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind what people say about Mary .
He &apos;s not a boy anymore .
Tom made a bad decision .
It is long way to the town .
Tom didn &apos;t need to wait very long .
Have you heard from Tom ?
Why are you here , Tom ?
What was Tom doing out there all by himself ?
All of us can speak French .
Do you have any plans for the weekend ?
I could write Tom a note if you want me to .
Here &apos;s the key .
Tom only did that once .
I don &apos;t know why Tom got sick .
Are you hurt ?
Your daughter is not a child anymore .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t wait any longer .
Tom decided .
Where &apos;s the boy ?
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
You have to ask Tom first .
Is Tom back yet ?
How long have you been waiting ?
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t here .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Tom will probably come .
The old man sat all alone .
America loves you .
I have a week to do my homework .
Who did Tom plan on going to Australia with ?
He will become a good doctor .
I want to do it .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of Tom recently .
What does Tom do ?
She plays the piano every day .
It would be great if you could sing .
Why don &apos;t you want to live in Boston ?
I &apos;m disappointed with you .
You may see Tom there .
What would Tom say if he were here ?
You need to learn French .
Just give me what I want .
Why didn &apos;t you inform me ?
Tom let me down .
I will go if I must .
She was young .
Why don &apos;t we try doing this again tomorrow ?
We don &apos;t want you here .
Tom goes to school five days a week .
We &apos;re pretty pleased with that .
Tom got almost everything he needed .
I can &apos;t conceive of living without him .
The news can &apos;t be true .
We &apos;ve seen them .
Tom is serious .
I wish I could do more .
Tom wanted to be rich .
I &apos;m thinking about it .
Is that your sister ?
You should know better .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to us .
The boy bought a dog .
She is a mere child .
Tom loves money .
I think Tom is afraid of your dog .
Do you have any good books for children to read ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Tom can speak French as well .
I can not afford to keep a car .
Tom &apos;s home .
He comes to see me nearly every day .
Are you really going to move to Boston ?
Nobody wants others to think they &apos;re stupid .
She intends to play tennis tomorrow afternoon .
Tom and I used to visit each other every weekend .
Open your mouth .
What is it you &apos;d like to know ?
Tom really likes music a lot .
Tom was happy to oblige .
His name is Tom , not John .
I talked about music .
Tom has already gone to sleep .
Did you tell Tom ?
I &apos;m not sure how that happened .
Leave the food on the table .
Did he come by bus or by train ?
It &apos;s what I want .
What have you ever done for us ?
I &apos;m probably not the only one here who can &apos;t do that .
Tom asked Mary if she was busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s saying .
I knew it was a bad idea .
I wouldn &apos;t mind a cup of coffee .
I think my French isn &apos;t very good .
He is eating .
I &apos;ve never heard of him before .
As was expected , he won the prize .
Have you called the boss already ?
I &apos;m getting better .
I had trouble with this question .
I knew I recognized Tom from somewhere .
Definitely !
Here is the book you are looking for .
Perhaps that &apos;s true .
Tom and Mary are getting married .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t hungry .
I saw Tom working on the report this morning .
Tom created this .
No one lives in that building .
I love everything about you .
Never be this late again .
How do you like Australia ?
Tom saw him .
Where does this book go ?
Put your hands on the car .
Tom is still asleep .
I go to school with Tom .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what had happened .
I really couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
I think that &apos;s too expensive .
Where is my brother ?
I don &apos;t know what you do .
It &apos;s your only chance .
Do you want another cup of coffee ?
Tom is still working for us .
I &apos;ve often heard Tom say that .
Never say never .
It shouldn &apos;t be too difficult to do that .
Tom and Mary are watching TV .
They &apos;re right behind you .
Tom never talks about money .
How was Tom &apos;s party ?
That didn &apos;t work .
I don &apos;t know you .
I ran .
There is nothing I can do to change that .
What do you like ?
Take my coat .
He lost a book .
Were you telling the truth ?
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s sister .
What did you guys do ?
I want to try this .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook so well , Tom .
You can hear everything .
He asked a question about it .
What time do you open ?
That boy is running .
How about you ?
Dinner is ready .
Tom may be up .
I forgot that Tom didn &apos;t speak French .
I should &apos;ve taken the money .
That &apos;s just the way he is .
Where will we meet ?
This boy is my son .
I &apos;m doing what I want to do .
He has made me what I am today .
Tom had a son .
It &apos;s still not working .
May I have your name ?
Where &apos;s my watch ?
I love cake .
I took a week off .
I find this difficult to believe .
The box is too heavy to carry .
Where is the nearest shop ?
It happens now and then .
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
In any case , I &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
What kind of a camera do you have ?
I could swim well even when I was a boy .
Have you seen that movie ?
You can &apos;t do that .
Didn &apos;t you read the book ?
Why aren &apos;t they back ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to buy a camera .
This is his answer to my letter .
You need a new hat .
I don &apos;t want to go to sleep .
How could anyone not like music ?
The two of us are students .
This happens all the time .
I can &apos;t imagine why Tom would do something like that .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to go to bed .
Your mother would have been very proud of you .
I &apos;ve got to see you .
Tom and Mary are getting married in October .
We couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
I have to go to the little boys &apos; room .
I &apos;ll write to Tom again .
Who could forget it ?
I have just three dollars left .
I already told you that .
I don &apos;t know anything about her .
Tom seldom talks about himself .
Your things are all here .
I must make an apology to her .
Tom is a very good friend .
You don &apos;t know how much I love you .
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
They &apos;ll no doubt be searching for us .
Could you please tell me how to do that ?
She gave them some apples .
Let &apos;s try something .
Who told you the story ?
I think we have enough time .
That &apos;s how we do it in Boston .
Don &apos;t ask me what it was .
I thought Tom was dead .
Tom seems to be sick .
That never should &apos;ve happened .
I &apos;m hungry , too .
I want Tom to see these .
You should learn French .
Who gave you this ?
Tom changed clothes .
I would often take a walk before breakfast .
We &apos;ve already learned a lot .
I knew that Tom was from Boston .
I hate not winning .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as carefully as I do .
What &apos;s that in your pocket ?
I saw you in the park yesterday .
He made her a new coat .
It cannot last long .
Tom gets up early .
I &apos;m very happy in Boston .
That &apos;s another matter .
We can &apos;t do this ourselves .
Where does he work ?
It has nothing to do with me .
Tom looks like his brother .
He can barely read .
I think we should go .
Those are my things .
How can I get to the airport ?
I found the key that I was looking for .
The girl is small for her age .
Would you like to have another cup of tea ?
Didn &apos;t Tom go to Mary &apos;s house ?
I don &apos;t want to leave Boston .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
Tom wanted you to think he &apos;d left town .
Where do you come from ?
I don &apos;t know where that is .
I don &apos;t want to get married until I &apos;m in my thirties .
Where &apos;s the car ?
Maybe he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
Can I have the paper when you &apos;re finished with it ?
She brought a cup of tea to me .
I didn &apos;t want that .
Tom didn &apos;t come until 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t like him either .
You &apos;ve already won .
I feel lost without you .
When you get to be my age , you &apos;ll understand what I mean .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Tom knows what to do , doesn &apos;t he ?
Have you seen him before ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like it .
Tom found it difficult to solve the problem .
This town is quite different from what it was ten years ago .
You should know that &apos;s impossible .
I told Tom the truth .
She might come .
Tom showed Mary something .
Tom looks rather nervous .
I don &apos;t believe you can do it .
I would like to see your mother .
I have a lot of land .
She played the piano beautifully .
How are we going to help Tom ?
Tom has to leave in a few minutes .
Do what you want to do .
You should phone Tom .
We arrived home late .
I only need one thing .
Go look for it .
Tom didn &apos;t come home .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
It &apos;s likely that she &apos;ll succeed .
I can &apos;t find my keys .
Maybe you can &apos;t hear me .
Were you expecting something different ?
The train left at exactly five o &apos;clock .
Tom really enjoys doing that .
That isn &apos;t to my liking .
Tom didn &apos;t want it .
Tom talks very loud .
Tom gave me a tour of his house .
I said I &apos;d go .
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
I just found it .
I need you to drive me to the station .
Tom isn &apos;t a very good man .
I don &apos;t have a garden .
Are you sure about this ?
I &apos;m not so lucky .
I &apos;m going out with Mary .
I had a tennis match with him .
I &apos;m so cold .
My sister usually walks to school .
Tom is going to apologize .
He runs as fast as you .
I fear nothing .
Tom lived in Boston for three years .
Aren &apos;t you hungry , Tom ?
I took my hat off .
There are more girls than boys in our school .
You must not eat anything for a few days .
I wrote this letter in French .
Have you read that book ?
I know all of them .
Come if you can .
I &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
It has to stop .
He cannot answer their questions .
You &apos;re quite right .
I &apos;m disappointed in you .
Tom knows what we &apos;re doing .
I want you to go to Boston with Tom .
She came to my aid .
Tom , what would you like to have for dinner ?
Tom isn &apos;t heavy .
We have one for you , too .
You need a key .
We still have a lot of time .
That looks expensive .
Were you expecting something different ?
How many times have you done this ?
What have you done with my bag ?
We have to go .
It is impossible for me to solve the problem .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like it .
Do you want to be rich ?
Can anyone hear me ?
Tom took some money out of his pocket .
What are they asking you to do ?
I love you for who you are .
The baby is able to walk .
I didn &apos;t see him .
He doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
It wasn &apos;t enough .
We &apos;re very busy just now .
All good things must come to an end .
School is over now .
I was just talking about you .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
I &apos;m happy .
I have no one to talk to .
There &apos;s nothing in this room .
I &apos;m used to eating alone .
Tom has bought a new car .
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
My father is in the garden now .
Tom has really been very busy .
You don &apos;t have to go to school on Sunday .
Please leave Tom alone .
Tom had money , a lot of it .
Do you like to be alone ?
I must organize my thoughts .
Give me that .
I can fix that for you .
You &apos;re not one of us .
The other one doesn &apos;t work .
French is one of the languages that I speak .
How would you like your eggs ?
She was about to start .
What are you after ?
Did he tell you anything ?
He listened to my opinion .
Tom went to the park by himself .
Did you come by car ?
I knew you &apos;d like that .
I do hope you &apos;ll succeed .
I thought you might like one of these .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
He didn &apos;t speak to me at all .
I am going to do it .
My parents don &apos;t like my girlfriend .
This was a lot of fun .
I don &apos;t want to dance .
Please ask whether they have this book at the library .
Don &apos;t give up like that .
I did everything all by myself .
You know it better than anyone else .
Tom wrote to his parents .
My father loves my mother .
Everyone must die .
How do you know where to go ?
Tom is older than me .
I do not understand you .
I have something else to do .
Tom won &apos;t leave if you don &apos;t want him to .
Are you saying you don &apos;t like this ?
Please don &apos;t let go of my hand .
I must catch the first train .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet whether he &apos;ll go or not .
Tom has an uncle who works in Australia .
I &apos;m not going to do that with Tom .
I &apos;m feeling a little tired .
He took his coat off and set to work .
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve .
How can you eat so much ?
Tom will do that again tomorrow .
What were you doing at the hospital ?
Do you know that I &apos;m in love with you ?
Tom and I didn &apos;t speak to each other for three years .
Why did you do what you did ?
Don &apos;t involve me in that matter .
Tom knows something I don &apos;t .
What do you think that is ?
When do you want to meet Tom ?
I wouldn &apos;t blame them .
There are few men who don &apos;t know that .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
I didn &apos;t understand your question .
I &apos;m going to be fine .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Be careful what you say .
It &apos;s a beautiful night , isn &apos;t it ?
He arrived late .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to lose Mary .
I &apos;ve never had that problem before .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
We need to get to the airport .
Tom isn &apos;t yet able to write his own name .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I &apos;m not going to say that .
Tom got a little pie .
Do it Monday .
Tom comes to see me once in a while .
Why do you think Tom said that ?
Please ask someone else .
I have just finished eating .
I want to speak to Tom .
I thought that he would come .
It just was not my day yesterday .
What has he done to you ?
Why are you pretending you don &apos;t remember ?
What do you want from Tom ?
That &apos;ll make Tom very happy .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Tom said he would buy it .
It may rain .
He is absorbed in his work .
I &apos;m good at that .
That &apos;s not what Tom says .
Who else is there with you ?
Tom is a little over thirty .
We need you .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t feel like doing that today .
I feel so happy when I &apos;m with you .
Tom is doing that .
How much did you pay for it ?
I would rather not go to school today .
Tom said Mary was good at French .
Nobody wants you to do this .
She came to like the house .
Are you awake ?
That boy looks like Tom .
Tell me everything you know about Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat .
Did you see that ?
I told you I don &apos;t want your help .
These people have lost everything .
I &apos;m out of here .
I know that was a mistake .
We have had little rain this summer .
I would like to go to sleep now .
Tom is working on it right now .
Why is it so important ?
Very little is known about them .
Why do you put up with that ?
I wrote this book .
Do you want to end up like Tom ?
This room is quiet .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
Could you please stop singing ?
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
Tom likes it there .
What they did made Tom happy .
I &apos;ve seen that face somewhere before .
I don &apos;t want this anymore .
He had barely enough money to buy bread and milk .
Tom put it in the box .
Everything is going very badly .
Tom came to visit us three days ago .
This isn &apos;t helping .
Now that I am here , you don &apos;t have to worry .
She lives alone .
Tom didn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
He gave me several books .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
How come you know English so well ?
You &apos;ll understand it later on .
That &apos;s a tall order .
I saw Tom take it .
I &apos;m Tom and this is Mary .
I want you to not go to Boston with Tom .
We won &apos;t know until October .
Tom needs to be located .
Is this your room ?
Which one do you like best ?
Is this seat empty ?
I wonder whether Tom is as old as Mary .
I &apos;ve got everything I want .
I know where that is .
Tom &apos;s well .
I don &apos;t love her .
He had an accident .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to be happy ?
We met at a party .
Tom told me to give you this .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom has already forgotten what I told him yesterday .
Tom , can you come tomorrow ?
Please feel free to ask questions .
Did Tom speak French ?
I don &apos;t really know .
Tom handed Mary the key .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
I found something .
Tom and I were both busy at that time .
Tom has a nice voice .
I got home at seven .
She is mad at me .
Why is Tom coming here ?
Have you told him yet ?
Tom has enough money .
Why are you home ?
I &apos;d be careful with that if I were you .
How was lunch ?
No one knows their name .
He remained silent .
You need to learn French .
Tom isn &apos;t OK .
I love you , too .
You can change it if you like .
I &apos;ve never heard you talk like that .
It &apos;s time to go to school .
How does this work exactly ?
This is what Tom deserves .
Why does Tom do things like that ?
Can I bring you anything else ?
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
Tom wished me success .
It is useless to talk to him .
We always take a bus .
It &apos;s more trouble than it &apos;s worth .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will leave Boston .
Has Tom eaten yet ?
I have been busy .
I prefer my own company .
Tom told me this would only take three hours .
They look good .
Tom will find you .
When do you want to meet Tom ?
Who is he talking to ?
We weren &apos;t given homework today .
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
I &apos;ve already started doing that .
I love going to the movies .
Tom introduced himself .
Tom and Mary are in love .
It was lucky that nobody died .
Tom and Mary seldom speak to each other in French .
Is he a doctor ?
Tom has no money in his pocket .
I haven &apos;t finished breakfast yet .
That &apos;s our train .
I need to speak with you right away .
Women are better at this than men .
These are my books .
Why is Tom there ?
Why did you pick Tom ?
What more do you want ?
I have just been to the airport to see my friend off .
It &apos;s likely to take much longer than you think it will .
I gave him my phone number .
I &apos;ve already seen Tom about that matter .
Tom wasn &apos;t even hurt .
Tom knows why .
I arrived late last night .
Do it now .
You need to buy him some new clothes .
I love this game .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
It &apos;s going to stop raining soon .
It is said that she is a good cook .
I know where Tom lives .
I like dogs very much .
I don &apos;t think Tom will like this place .
Tom knew that the story wasn &apos;t true .
Tom was right about that .
What did you do this week ?
Tom &apos;ll know .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
I was aching all over .
Can you hear us ?
I &apos;m still young .
I will not do it again .
I didn &apos;t ask you for your opinion .
Tom is with us .
I want to do it for Tom .
Tom no longer loves Mary .
I need to ask you some questions .
It doesn &apos;t fit .
Tom is watching .
Tom already ate .
Which is your guitar ?
Tom stayed and helped Mary .
Tom knows all about Mary .
Let &apos;s meet again in October .
We &apos;re still looking .
You need me more than I need you .
Is that too much to ask ?
Did you enjoy reading that book ?
What was the weather like ?
Can you show me how to do this ?
Your friend is tired .
It was good news .
I &apos;m going to bed early tonight .
Tom said he only needed a few more minutes .
How long do you plan to stay ?
Tom could &apos;ve said something .
This book is better than any I have ever read .
I am well acquainted with him .
Tom was late for the meeting this afternoon .
I hate Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
We had less snow this winter than we had expected .
What else can you do ?
I knew that I shouldn &apos;t do that .
You can &apos;t use that .
I would like to visit Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to .
I think that you &apos;re right .
I love Australia .
Tom is learning English .
My brother is holding a camera in his hand .
Are you really a doctor ?
I like your dogs .
My mother is angry .
Her book is very interesting .
I &apos;ll be back in less than five minutes .
We &apos;re not going to make it , are we ?
What &apos;s up ?
Tom put his glasses back on .
I never had to worry about money .
Tom isn &apos;t quite finished yet .
He can hardly walk .
Do you want this or not ?
He arrived earlier than usual .
This book is too difficult to understand .
Tom loves doing this .
That &apos;s not all Tom said .
I really don &apos;t need any help .
He started singing .
That &apos;s not my car .
No one knows where Tom is .
I have read the book .
What do you want to see ?
Tom isn &apos;t good at doing that .
They &apos;re at home .
The dog likes you .
I did it for you .
Doing this makes me happy .
I was late for the last bus .
Look at this .
Are you injured ?
You &apos;re perfectly right .
I &apos;ll ask Tom tomorrow .
Who is your friend ?
I met him on my way home from school .
What time does the train leave for Boston ?
Tom isn &apos;t my father .
I know the boy .
Tom &apos;s first wife was from Boston .
Why are you sleeping ?
Get off of Tom .
These came for you .
What &apos;s Tom doing here again ?
A lot still remains to be done .
What you are saying does not make sense .
I blame Tom .
We won &apos;t let it happen again .
Women like Tom .
I feel very sick .
Who was the girl you were talking to ?
Tom said he was going to help Mary .
I won &apos;t forget this .
I want one , too .
We &apos;re not in danger .
When will you finish your work ?
We &apos;re going to Boston to see Tom .
Tom showed Mary &apos;s letter to me .
Now is the time .
Did you let Tom drive your car ?
I go to school .
We are leaving Japan tomorrow morning .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Tom didn &apos;t want my help .
It &apos;s time to go home now .
There &apos;s someone else I want to see .
Tom went back to sleep .
We want our money .
Tom hasn &apos;t given us anything .
I can wait no longer .
That &apos;s going to happen .
Tom works slowly .
That doesn &apos;t happen often .
Maybe he will be a good teacher .
Tom wrote down what Mary said .
I &apos;d like to hear that song again .
Is there anything else I need to know ?
Where did you get it ?
Let me tell you what Tom said .
Tom must be over thirty .
I wonder how long it &apos;s going to take .
I thought you said Tom was your brother .
It didn &apos;t end well .
When do you play tennis ?
How many times have you been there ?
It &apos;s very hard getting a taxi in this city .
Tom &apos;s father died before he was born .
How are you not seeing that ?
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
Can you walk ?
I &apos;ve let everybody down .
I got up early to catch the first train .
You can &apos;t swim , can you ?
You look young for your age .
What do you know about Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t drive .
I will speak to you tomorrow .
I just can &apos;t do it .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary just said that .
I know a man who can help .
Not everyone agrees with you .
You can &apos;t count on his help .
I don &apos;t want to go jogging with you .
Tom isn &apos;t going to have to do that by himself .
Many people only speak one language .
That would be difficult .
Where are my things ?
You weren &apos;t that bad .
Tom is taller than Mary .
No one wants to talk about books anymore .
What does he want to do ?
She plays the guitar .
It &apos;s no longer available .
I phoned him .
I came looking for you .
I &apos;m against the war .
I heard something .
Tom , are you okay ?
I don &apos;t know exactly .
This dog runs fast .
Tom should &apos;ve done it the way you told him to do it .
I can &apos;t see it .
Let &apos;s study .
Tom helps us .
Take what you like .
He wants to be a doctor in the future .
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
My friend helped me .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything all day .
The box was too heavy .
What I want isn &apos;t tea , but coffee .
Tom got nervous .
Here we go .
She is not always happy .
It isn &apos;t much further .
I &apos;m not scared of anything .
I &apos;ll talk to Tom .
The beer &apos;s very cold .
We expect him tomorrow at ten o &apos;clock .
I &apos;d really like to help .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
This book is very heavy .
Tom did well in school .
Tom saw Mary working in her garden .
I can &apos;t see well .
I know what this is .
Tom said that he wanted to go to Boston .
I get on well with him .
You &apos;re too young to get married .
How did you get to know him ?
I think Tom likes me .
Give that back to me .
Is Tom alone now ?
You can do it at your leisure .
Tom is the one with the problem .
He visited his uncle yesterday .
Do you think Tom is in love with you ?
You can still help Tom , can &apos;t you ?
What are we going to do with that ?
Tom has been a teacher for thirty years .
We love it here .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
Tom drove back to Mary &apos;s house .
It can happen to anybody .
Thanks for the book .
You may do whatever you want to .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
Here &apos;s your desk .
I &apos;m not very good at cooking .
I think I &apos;ve fallen in love with you .
How did you come to school ?
That won &apos;t be hard to do .
Don &apos;t listen to her .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
I don &apos;t want to buy this kind of sofa .
What &apos;s it really worth ?
I can hardly wait .
Where &apos;s it from ?
You don &apos;t speak English , do you ?
Tom needs the money right away .
We &apos;re doing it together .
I did that already .
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think it was possible .
Tom may have read the letter .
They must be happy .
How am I going to do that ?
Tom wasn &apos;t happy about the situation .
Can I help you with that ?
This watch is my father &apos;s .
I just did that this morning .
I know you &apos;re thinking about me .
Tom is too busy to help .
They &apos;re looking for it .
Turn off the light .
I have difficulty believing that .
I don &apos;t know if it is true .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
I &apos;ll believe it when I see it .
I spoke to him yesterday .
Nobody &apos;s ever heard of him .
He caught a big fish .
The glass dropped from his hand .
When are you walking home ?
You can &apos;t pretend that it didn &apos;t happen .
Both of you be quiet .
Tom is much taller than I am .
How can this be ?
Can I have a word with you in private ?
I never meant to put you in any danger .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to Mary .
Tom thinks he knows what Mary wants .
I will go when they come back here .
How many times did you talk to Tom last week ?
Don &apos;t you know how ?
He does not like cats .
If it were up to me , I &apos;d say yes .
I think they want you to do it .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Is he dead ?
Have you read this book already ?
Please put your shoes on .
I wish somebody would help me do that .
I &apos;m managing .
Did anybody else see it ?
Tom can &apos;t sleep .
You know why we &apos;re here .
That man is Tom .
It seems to me that something &apos;s wrong .
Tom let Mary do whatever she wanted to do .
There was someone else there .
Why won &apos;t anybody help me ?
He won the prize last week .
She met him on the beach .
I hear that he &apos;s still alive .
I &apos;ve said all I have to say .
I have something for you .
Why did you become a police officer ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to look .
He bought a hat .
He bought a book and gave it to his father .
What do you have for me ?
I know what those books are like .
Tom , I want to talk to you .
Tom is at the hotel now .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
What do you like to eat ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that Tom had a daughter ?
Tom has a terrible crush on Mary .
What would you have done in Tom &apos;s place ?
Tom is at school right now .
I deserve it .
Tom has been there for three years .
There was a lot of snow .
How important are children to you ?
Where do you work ?
I &apos;m glad that you asked Tom for advice .
I &apos;ve got to get Tom home .
I might not go swimming today .
He did not know what to say .
We understand this .
I want this to be yours .
She was born lucky .
How have you been keeping ?
Tom wants Mary .
Look , I &apos;m not doing this .
He gave me all his money .
What caused the fire ?
What &apos;s Tom doing ?
What &apos;s your problem ?
I agree with both of you .
I &apos;ll be fine .
They are good people .
Tom is a newcomer .
What &apos;s Tom want ?
Give those to Tom .
It &apos;s very interesting .
I &apos;m going to the park .
It was Tom &apos;s idea .
Your friend is correct .
Why are you so disappointed ?
It makes sense .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour .
Tom may have been there . I don &apos;t know .
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
Come back in a month .
You know Tom likes Mary .
I don &apos;t want you .
He will be back in a second .
No one is going with me .
I like dogs .
You take the money .
I couldn &apos;t see Tom &apos;s face .
Tom put his suitcase down next to Mary &apos;s .
Can we do this later ?
What &apos;s mine &apos;s yours .
I need a new shirt .
Perhaps he knows this story .
This coat fits you .
We &apos;re getting fewer and fewer students .
Can I take a day off ?
You &apos;re better than Tom .
Can I wait for Tom here ?
Tom has a dog .
What do I look like ?
Everything that Tom said is true .
They don &apos;t have to go to school today .
I owe you an apology .
Tom could &apos;ve figured that out without any help .
Tom thinks that &apos;s true .
How &apos;s your boy doing ?
I guess that &apos;s impossible .
None of this was meant to happen .
It made me very rich .
I met her last winter .
How large is your family ?
You haven &apos;t paid me yet .
I think Tom is going to call you .
Thanks for doing all this .
Come here before seven o &apos;clock .
He has made me what I am .
You could &apos;ve said something .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
Why are you speaking French to Tom ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
Let me help you .
I don &apos;t know what to think .
Now we know what happened .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
She is very cross with him .
We all have a right to be happy .
When will this be returned to me ?
You &apos;ll see it again .
If anyone can fix this , it &apos;s Tom .
Why do you learn English ?
A dog was running .
This car is fast .
I don &apos;t know why I did that .
We have a lot of work to do .
Tom &apos;s glad .
Is it here that the bus stops ?
I study French after dinner every day .
I &apos;ve had enough .
I can still hear your voice .
Why did you do that ?
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
Tom was supposed to be at school today , but he wasn &apos;t .
She is walking .
Tom didn &apos;t think it was right .
What &apos;re you saying ?
I think about her often .
You may go now .
Tom is already married .
I must study .
He can &apos;t afford a new car .
She slept for a few hours .
I &apos;m already married .
What would the world be without women ?
He gets mad very easily .
I couldn &apos;t attend that party because I was sick .
This movie was very interesting .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
It &apos;s often said that women live longer than men .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
I want to be in Boston .
They don &apos;t listen .
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
I like the rain and the snow .
Tom and I will meet you there .
We &apos;re not happy .
It is really quite a good story .
I &apos;m coming home .
Can you help ?
Your family needs you .
I want to tell you about Tom .
Tom returned the shirt because it was too small .
This job pays pretty well .
They say he &apos;s very rich .
This book was new .
I need to know where you are .
What &apos;s the best way to lose weight ?
Tom is probably in the building .
It &apos;s not this one .
Tom didn &apos;t get very far .
I like studying English .
We know what you want .
We can &apos;t stay for dinner .
We all make mistakes , right ?
I had him repair my watch .
You know I love you !
Tom can &apos;t be old enough to have a daughter as old as Mary .
It &apos;s not worth the money .
I won &apos;t be back for a while .
Tom was here with Mary .
Speaking French is very difficult for me .
I &apos;ll never forget you .
Where can I catch the bus to the station ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
What &apos;s all that ?
Tom is outside waiting for Mary .
I don &apos;t like tennis much .
English is not hard to learn .
What can I get you ?
Tom went into the house .
I &apos;m still a little hungry .
He is getting better day by day .
Did you see your friends last week ?
We &apos;re a long way from home .
Where are you going for your holidays this year ?
He was the last to leave .
He did it for fun .
I only wish I &apos;d been able to do more for Tom .
He is no longer here .
I &apos;m good at this .
When are you going to come home ?
Please tell me your name .
I wish I had seen her .
People who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t have to .
That &apos;s been tried .
He speaks English .
May I go home now ?
He came home at ten .
What do you know about him ?
I hope it stops raining .
This could take a long time .
I can &apos;t talk to you here . It &apos;s too dangerous .
She is not up yet .
You could ask Tom .
Is this your dictionary ?
Tom said he was asked to help .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school here anymore .
I have to speak with you .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
The work must be completed at once .
Tom worries about everything .
They invited me to the party .
Thank you for calling me on time .
I &apos;ll phone you .
Ask him when the next plane leaves .
We took a walk in the park .
Do you want to live in Boston ?
Come with me .
Why do I need to be in Boston ?
Tom thought he would be late .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to dance .
I hear you .
Tom is unlikely to come by himself .
I have things to do .
Everything &apos;s fine .
You &apos;re a good girl .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
I won &apos;t forget it .
Where are you from ?
If you don &apos;t do that , I won &apos;t do that either .
This is a film all parents should watch .
Tom &apos;s voice was calm .
He can &apos;t read it .
How did Tom know that Mary would be here ?
We &apos;ve forgotten something .
Your father is tall .
How are you today ?
I didn &apos;t think it mattered .
The weather is bad today .
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
Won &apos;t you sit down ?
Look ! There &apos;s a cat in the kitchen .
I require your advice .
I only told you what Tom told me .
She has a few books .
I don &apos;t have time for a vacation this year .
She had the kindness to help me .
Tom &apos;s left .
I don &apos;t like this one .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had .
I eat here .
Give me a chance to make you proud of me .
Tom died a few hours later .
I found you .
You must have lost them .
Tom tried hard , but failed .
All the dogs are alive .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s decision .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
He asked me whether I was busy .
It had started to rain .
Tom is in the park .
This has been happening quite a lot lately .
I haven &apos;t seen you in a long time .
What did Tom do yesterday ?
I didn &apos;t know she was ill .
Did you go straight home after school yesterday ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come .
Tom looks sleepy .
We are moving next month .
Tom blocked Mary &apos;s way and wouldn &apos;t let her enter the room .
We found it .
How much should they get ?
Nobody &apos;s happy .
Tom said something , but I couldn &apos;t hear what he said .
Tom ran to his car .
He has been studying French for eight years .
You remind me of my daughter .
What &apos;s Tom doing out there ?
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
She spent more money than usual .
I &apos;m the only one who understands you .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom is gone .
Did Tom ask us to wait ?
I can &apos;t leave until I find out who Tom is .
Why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
That &apos;s fortunate .
The girl talking with Tom is Mary .
All the students forgot to read that book .
Tom continued talking .
Tom often talks with Mary .
You must show me how it works .
Tom said that .
Tom handed Mary something .
How many windows are there ?
Tom is studying at his desk .
Leave the food on the table .
Do you want to sit down for a few minutes ?
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
Who does Tom think is going to win ?
I can &apos;t tell you everything .
I &apos;ve been seeking an answer to your question .
I don &apos;t know for sure .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that &apos;s what Tom needs .
I &apos;m fairly confident that I can do that .
I love doing that .
When did you finish it ?
I don &apos;t know what they do .
I &apos;ll be in the library .
That is how it happened .
I was in Boston for almost the whole summer .
I know something Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Did Tom ask about me ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet decided what to do .
I think I &apos;ve seen enough .
What does your dad do ?
Tom said that I could sleep on the sofa .
I cannot tell how this is done .
Tom saw Mary dancing with John .
Tom eats very quickly .
I left my shoes at school .
I wish you had not told the story to my mother .
Let &apos;s wait till he comes back .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
You don &apos;t really care , do you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how Mary will get to school tomorrow .
Tom gives us everything we need .
You look content .
Could you tell me your name again ?
I had my camera stolen .
Where could the cat be ?
She loves coffee .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that .
Tom stayed at a hotel .
Who would be stupid enough to do that ?
We could go together .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat .
I would like to go to Japan .
How did Tom do this ?
I want to have nothing to do with you .
I &apos;m glad to see that you &apos;re happy .
I had nothing to say .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
The movie was almost three hours long .
That is her house .
That &apos;s hers .
They &apos;ll like that .
Tom was very helpful yesterday .
I have to give Tom this book .
I don &apos;t think Tom is capable of doing that .
Tom put his hat on and went outside .
I &apos;m glad of that .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
I need some help with my homework .
You &apos;ll do it .
I am like my father .
Tom says he &apos;s doing that .
I just heard that Tom and Mary are going to get married .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
I know Tom is happy .
Tom didn &apos;t even know who Mary was .
She can speak three languages .
I &apos;d love to see you .
Yesterday , I ate an apple .
It &apos;s still raining .
I will speak with you tomorrow .
You &apos;re good , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom is a few years older than me .
Tom works for Mary .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
None of us knows what is in store for us .
He was busy with his homework .
Can I give you a piece of advice ?
He seems to be wary of us .
I know you want to be rich .
I can &apos;t tell you what happened .
They &apos;ll know what to do .
How was your birthday ?
Could you come to my office when you have a moment ?
Tom wants to come home .
Tom didn &apos;t run .
This house has six rooms .
I do love you .
Thank you for this .
Where did you get this beautiful dress ?
It &apos;s very dangerous .
Tom fell asleep under the tree .
It &apos;s very dangerous .
Do you have a phone ?
He said that he would be back soon .
We know we &apos;ve got big problems .
I &apos;ve seen that .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know you .
Maybe she won &apos;t come .
Tom is living with his parents .
This is not funny .
Won &apos;t you have another piece of cake ?
This is exactly what I wanted to see .
You won &apos;t die today .
I &apos;ve been working .
What are you going to be when you grow up ?
You know who I am .
He found his key and opened the door .
It hurts .
I had my watch stolen .
I don &apos;t know what to say to Tom .
He took off his hat .
That looks good .
I can &apos;t find my key .
I don &apos;t have anything to eat .
That &apos;s what Tom keeps telling me .
We should get married .
He &apos;s somewhere in the park .
I already told my parents .
I &apos;ll be with you .
My friends don &apos;t know where I am .
What time did you arrive there ?
I can hardly understand what he says .
Tom told me he was going to go home early today .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I love him more than any of the other boys .
We have to be there Monday .
I don &apos;t know whether to tell Tom or not .
My family is very proud of me .
I think Tom blames himself .
I wasn &apos;t able to finish doing that as soon as I thought I &apos;d be able to .
Don &apos;t walk away from me .
Tom knew that Mary was hungry .
Tom went to Boston by car .
Tom looked for the key .
I was tired , but I couldn &apos;t sleep .
You &apos;ve got to stay awake .
We have one for you , too .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
What did you miss ?
Everything happens for a reason .
He doesn &apos;t want kids .
Get to the point .
Nobody knows except Tom and me .
This is my desk .
Tom has nothing else to do .
She has been sick since last week .
I &apos;ll take that matter upon myself .
What did you do last night ?
I don &apos;t think Tom will mind .
You are no longer a baby .
Children should go to school .
She &apos;s older than Tom .
Why won &apos;t Tom listen to me ?
I saw Tom tonight .
We know you have it .
I knew that today would be fun .
You don &apos;t need to come into the office tomorrow .
They won &apos;t have arrived yet .
Tom asked me to tell you something .
I bought the car .
Go to school .
He &apos;s not in .
They don &apos;t know that .
This is the house where he was born .
Tom is taller than I am .
You had better tell me now .
The dogs are in the garden .
My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English .
I &apos;d like to help , but I can &apos;t .
Here is my key .
Let me carry it .
I am sorry for you .
You ought to wait for Tom .
How did you meet Tom ?
Tom can &apos;t swim and Mary can &apos;t either .
Mary &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s name is Tom .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
That &apos;s where Tom is .
I &apos;ll take one .
You are not to leave this room .
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
How &apos;s it going at school ?
I need some time with Tom .
What language do they speak in the United States ?
Tom seemed lost .
I like Tom , too .
I can &apos;t go home .
Is that what you think ?
That &apos;s not good .
Why don &apos;t you like Tom ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is in Boston .
How long &apos;s this going to take ?
Please don &apos;t open the window .
Tom saw it , too .
Tom took my money .
Come quickly .
I have to find it .
How old is your daughter ?
We know all about you .
I went to drink a beer with friends .
Tom has small hands .
Please give me a little more time .
Who were you talking to ?
I worked all this week .
You never should &apos;ve left your husband .
They &apos;re looking for Tom .
Why do you do what you do ?
I can &apos;t believe that actually happened .
You didn &apos;t have to do this .
I accept the offer .
That &apos;s how I know .
I knew you &apos;d say that .
Tom is being very careful .
The last time I saw Tom he was headed towards the beach .
Tom goes jogging every day after work .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I didn &apos;t actually do that myself .
She was busy .
English is spoken in America .
Won &apos;t you have another glass of milk ?
Let Tom buy what he wants .
They all have come .
What don &apos;t I understand ?
What are you doing today ?
It was his decision .
I &apos;m not feeling very well .
Tom should eat .
Are they alive ?
Tom wanted to start a new life .
I feel it now .
Don &apos;t say a word .
It happens all the time .
I &apos;m one of you .
I like your hat .
I don &apos;t know what to do with it .
I have just finished eating lunch .
I want you to leave us alone .
Tom has died .
He speaks really well .
I can &apos;t think of his name .
She can &apos;t live without him .
I &apos;ve found something I &apos;d like to show you .
I &apos;m learning French .
When did you begin to learn English ?
There was nothing we could have done .
Do you want to know why I &apos;m here ?
There isn &apos;t much money in this business .
No one lives here .
Tom and Mary are getting married on Monday .
That &apos;s my affair .
Tom and Mary are the same age .
It &apos;s dangerous to swim in this river .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
It helped me a lot .
I don &apos;t really like you .
Tom has probably already forgotten about you .
He is going to stay at a friend &apos;s house .
What &apos;ll Tom do with it ?
I have enough money .
There &apos;s one thing in particular that I &apos;m interested in .
Tom lost his voice .
I must have forgotten it .
You can &apos;t have any of this cake .
That was really bad .
How many were there ?
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
Please take a seat .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way I speak .
Tom was angry .
You aren &apos;t Tom .
Tom is the one doing that .
Have you decided what you &apos;re going to do ?
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
How hot is it going to get ?
Did you read the whole book ?
I &apos;ll take Tom to Mary .
The party was just getting started .
He often helps others .
Tom isn &apos;t doing a very good job .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
He saw it , too .
I can &apos;t work with Tom .
Why do I have to learn all this stuff ?
Tom hasn &apos;t called .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom teaches French to my children .
Nobody saw it coming .
You can &apos;t pretend this didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s possible , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ll help you .
Tom looks nervous .
I wonder if Tom still likes Mary .
Give that back to me .
I &apos;m very disappointed in you .
Tom didn &apos;t know what I was trying to do .
The question is how he will get the money .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
Tell Tom I won &apos;t be there .
Tom isn &apos;t very happy , is he ?
That &apos;s his .
Would you like me to show you how to do that ?
I want to go to Australia with my family .
They &apos;re brother and sister .
Tom is not happy , either .
Do come to the party .
We &apos;re married .
Tom is going to win .
Tom is like me .
I love it !
Tom wanted to dance with Mary .
He can &apos;t do it .
When does Tom go to school ?
How are you all ?
Do we really want to walk to Tom &apos;s house ?
That made me think of you .
Tom &apos;s parents weren &apos;t home .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like this anymore .
I &apos;d like to ask you about Tom .
Tom said that he couldn &apos;t swim well .
We have to make a decision .
Tom will help us , won &apos;t he ?
I have a wife .
Can you take me home now ?
She took a walk before breakfast .
He comes round once a week .
It looks like Tom got what he wanted .
I got a lot out of that book I read .
I can &apos;t do anything .
I suppose it can &apos;t be helped .
I &apos;d very much like to go .
I accept your offer .
I &apos;m sorry for that .
I don &apos;t want anybody writing about me .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying .
I want to see my brother .
Why do you believe Tom ?
You two seem to get along well .
We aren &apos;t in danger , are we ?
The water will come to a boil in 5 minutes or so .
Speaking French is a lot of fun .
I have no money .
How do you get to school ?
Most of my friends are guys .
I thought the woman I met yesterday was Tom &apos;s mother .
Have you heard what I said ?
Tom made me say those things .
When did you buy it ?
We &apos;ll take it .
His name isn &apos;t Tom .
I hope I haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
That wouldn &apos;t be Tom , would it ?
He has another son .
You really are strong .
I stopped going there .
I &apos;m not as rich as I &apos;d like to be .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
You &apos;re nervous .
I am no longer tired .
Your friend is correct .
I had no difficulty in finding your office .
You can &apos;t pretend that it didn &apos;t happen .
You are exactly like your father .
Let &apos;s eat .
I see him in the library now and then .
I am still alone .
What else do you want to know ?
She still loves him .
I suppose you already know that &apos;s my car .
Tom is now up .
I have a gift for you .
I wish I could remember his name .
I &apos;d better be on my way .
This box is light enough to carry .
Tom will be dead in a few days .
You aren &apos;t going to walk , are you ?
Would you like to walk to the station with me ?
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I &apos;m thinking about you .
Tom said he wants to do everything by himself .
You &apos;re drunk .
Tom was about thirty when he moved to Boston .
I &apos;m very disappointed .
I &apos;m happy about that .
You have to make Tom believe you .
I didn &apos;t understand your question .
I should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
I wanted to have lunch with Tom tomorrow , but he told me he &apos;d be out of town .
I think I have an idea .
Never be afraid of making mistakes .
Can Tom ride a bicycle ?
We have lost sight of him .
Tom has a big TV .
I remember the day you were born very well .
Let &apos;s go tomorrow afternoon .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
Tom asked Mary not to drive so fast .
Tom was dangerous .
We always take a bus .
Tom was able to solve the problem .
I wonder if Tom is still outside .
You &apos;re not going to wear that , are you ?
He gave me a watch .
I don &apos;t understand why she doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
How should I know ?
Tom is with Mary .
How many people were present at the meeting ?
You &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
She had nothing to do yesterday .
May I show you something ?
You can ask Tom for help .
Why did you go there ?
Tom has started dating Mary .
I thought you &apos;d say that .
Tell me it &apos;s not true .
Tom &apos;s mother &apos;s dead .
Why are you going to Tom &apos;s again ?
He asked me what I needed .
I fear nothing .
Tom can take care of that .
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me .
We &apos;d like to know about it .
He asked her to read it for him .
There &apos;s a problem there that you don &apos;t see .
Are you busy ?
I arrived here just now .
You have beautiful eyes .
I think he is right .
I go to the park .
Tom read anything he could lay his hands on .
My work is done .
I know the man you came with .
I can sleep on the sofa .
I have something for you to do .
I have a different job now .
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has to listen to us .
I got up earlier than usual .
Everything makes sense now .
I heard her singing .
I am interested in getting a hat like this .
He &apos;s not very good at it .
Tom was really lucky .
He is thinking about the problem .
They know where we are .
I thought about Tom .
You can wait outside .
He has been playing tennis since this morning .
I need to go to the hospital .
Are you interested ?
We &apos;ll take Tom home .
Tom should work harder .
Do you want to know more ?
I don &apos;t have money .
Tom began to understand .
Tom was just trying to be funny .
I &apos;d like you to leave now .
He delivered a speech .
Is this your dog ?
He made up his mind .
I like them both .
Tom wants what Mary has .
I asked Tom if he wanted to go swimming .
This is Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom is a hard worker .
Here &apos;s Tom .
I &apos;m surprised you came at all .
My father gave me a watch , but I lost it .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
You &apos;ll have a hard time .
This morning it was very cold .
The letter returned .
Tom could help you .
I have only half as many books as he does .
I &apos;ll go if the weather &apos;s good .
We &apos;re no longer in danger .
Tom got really angry .
Why do they do that ?
Mary is wearing a new dress today .
It looks like an apple .
I &apos;d be quiet if I were you .
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework .
It &apos;s cold out there .
He called me a taxi .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
This work is anything but easy .
Tom wants to see us .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
We have a good life together .
I hope it &apos;s not too late .
It &apos;s a bad time .
You can &apos;t make everyone happy .
I know what your name is .
Tom wants to see me .
He may have been right .
I wish I had your problems .
Please listen to us .
Tom said he wanted to kill himself .
What &apos;s with Tom ?
Don &apos;t you want to stay here with us ?
We &apos;re rich .
I don &apos;t know why Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
There &apos;s no mistake .
Tom knows the answer .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to war .
It is too long ago .
This is my brother &apos;s .
Who is your friend ?
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me what I want to know .
I met her in the winter three years ago .
I don &apos;t think Tom is doing that .
Did you go to see a doctor ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Who saw what ?
It &apos;s not over yet .
You should learn how to use your dictionary .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Do you know why I gave it to you ?
Tom has decided not to move to Boston .
I want to know what you know .
I don &apos;t want to eat this .
You missed the meeting .
Everyone &apos;s different .
Tom was very disappointed .
I love you .
We &apos;re going to see Tom .
She needs it .
It &apos;s far from over .
The world is a big place .
I love my cat .
&quot; Here are some flowers for you . &quot; &quot; Thanks . They &apos;re gorgeous . &quot;
Who found them ?
What would you like to drink ?
Do you have a brother ?
Tom will be here any minute now .
He gave me back the money .
I can speak English a little .
Tom saw somebody .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you .
Do you have any questions ?
I already know that .
I can &apos;t recall her name at the moment .
I like this answer .
What have you done ?
May I sit down ?
We saw her enter the room .
How did they come here ?
The gate was open .
What a nice idea !
Don &apos;t deceive yourself .
I hate losing .
He &apos;s strong .
I had to study English .
Tom wanted more .
I cycle to work .
I don &apos;t have to answer your questions .
Tom killed Mary and then killed himself .
Tom is cold .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom lost a book .
Do you want to have some coffee ?
Do you know why I &apos;m here ?
They aren &apos;t here yet .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom to answer a few questions .
I was mildly disappointed .
Don &apos;t spend too much money .
I &apos;m thinking of you .
I lost my key .
I don &apos;t know the exact place I was born .
I wish that I could give you something .
That &apos;s life .
Tom is here .
Can I ask why not ?
I was in Boston last week .
We &apos;re just here to help .
How long have you been busy ?
Look behind you .
He must not live .
Tom can do it better than me .
He hasn &apos;t done anything .
I want a kitchen like this .
You can &apos;t stop now .
Tom will understand .
I still don &apos;t know .
Tom &apos;s speech was quite interesting .
I have done what I could .
Tom wanted to know everything about you .
You &apos;re very rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I hope you know what this is .
My wife is mad .
What are they saying ?
The only person Tom knows here is me .
The truth is that I don &apos;t really love you anymore .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
You need us .
Who do you think goes there ?
What &apos;s in the bag ?
He tried it with a friend .
Tom told Mary not to go there alone .
Tom knew that I was ready .
We have lots of other things to do .
I know what it takes .
If it were not for water , we couldn &apos;t live .
His house was small and old .
It &apos;s kind of hard to explain .
How long have you lived here ?
Tom began talking .
Tom said he would come to the party .
Tom sat on top of his desk , looking out the window .
Isn &apos;t that your dictionary ?
There is a message for you .
She asked him to open the window .
That &apos;s really a great idea .
I saw Tom a few minutes ago .
Could you please move out of my way ?
I saw nothing .
The answer is right .
Tom brought Mary a glass of water .
When did Tom buy his car ?
May I speak to you ?
No one was in the car .
The accident happened two hours ago .
This isn &apos;t a bad thing .
He did not read the book .
Tom realizes Mary doesn &apos;t like him very much .
That will pass .
That house is very small .
His uncle died five years ago .
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
I didn &apos;t mean it that way .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you have a car .
Would you like something to eat ?
Mary has not started yet .
I want to use this .
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
Take it home .
You should not talk here .
This is where I usually eat lunch .
You &apos;re like family .
Tom &apos;s French is hard to understand .
When did you see the film ?
Can you tell me the way to the bank ?
One wonders how it &apos;s possible .
I have to be in Boston by Monday .
What &apos;s going on with you , Tom ?
Are you Tom ?
Who will host the party ?
Where should we meet ?
It is entirely up to him whether he does it or not .
Let &apos;s see what &apos;s on TV .
I &apos;ll stay a few more days .
Leave out this word .
I was the only man there .
Can you imagine the world without money ?
My father is taking a walk in the park .
Why don &apos;t you come visit us ?
Are you sure that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to be done ?
Of course !
What &apos;s your horse &apos;s name ?
Tom sat down between Mary and her husband .
I &apos;m used to cooking for myself .
Tom helped us do that .
Would you explain it again ?
He came to my rescue .
Let Tom know .
I gave him what money I had .
Where did everyone else go ?
You know why I &apos;m here , don &apos;t you ?
Tom is starved .
Tom is very careful .
He speaks four languages .
She is able to speak ten languages .
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
My brother lives there .
I like your car .
I &apos;ve just lost the best friend I ever had .
I hardly ever get sick .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Tom asked why you had spent time in prison .
Tom often wears a hat .
That boy looks like you .
We were looking for Tom .
Where is my son ?
Tom has a new woman in his life .
What do you want to be when you grow up ?
Can he speak English ?
I will take care of the flowers .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
Tom ran out of water .
I have something to say to you .
We can &apos;t help you unless you help us .
I didn &apos;t really know what to do .
I wish you didn &apos;t do that .
Did you phone him ?
Can you show me the house ?
I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;ll help .
Tom was surprised by what he saw .
I think Tom knows French .
I thought Tom was in danger .
Tom writes very well .
Tom didn &apos;t have to tell Mary , but he did .
I &apos;ll read it .
This clock isn &apos;t working .
I &apos;ve loved you since the day I first saw you .
I &apos;ll tell the others .
I arrived this afternoon .
I can &apos;t imagine living like that .
Someone stole Tom &apos;s money .
My brother is two years older than I am .
Please speak slowly , so I can understand you .
What are you doing here , Tom ? Mary doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be disappointed .
That bag is mine .
I had trouble getting a taxi .
Perhaps it &apos;s time you told Tom about your accident .
How did you learn that Tom was living in Boston ?
I know this must be very difficult for you .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary are getting married .
I know Tom &apos;s in love with Mary .
Tom seems busy .
I &apos;m certain that he &apos;ll come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
Tom does that , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
I liked that book .
Tom will dance .
We have a lot of things we need to do .
Tom may not want to do that , but he should .
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy it .
We &apos;re still together .
Are we all happy ?
Tom taught me .
Can I stay a little longer ?
You should listen to him .
Tom looked very happy .
I wish I had married another man .
Where &apos;s your bag ?
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston .
I need to let Tom know .
I &apos;ll give you money .
Some kids are playing in the park .
I &apos;ll meet to you at eight .
Tom sat on the couch all alone .
I have to finish up some things before I go .
How are your parents doing ?
I begged Tom not to go .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Tom lives in a big house .
I have been here for two years .
Please say yes .
It doesn &apos;t bother me to walk in the rain .
When was the last time you were at your parents &apos; ?
My daughter wants a piano .
I don &apos;t have the time for this .
There were too many people there .
We were certain of winning the game .
I wrote to Tom .
Tom opened the door for me .
I don &apos;t understand at all .
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago .
We &apos;ve seen it before .
You never should &apos;ve done that .
I want to do this at home .
Each individual is different .
I think Tom is correct .
Tom is a good guy .
Tom left me for another woman .
I saw that one coming .
The students of this school are kind .
I &apos;m the only one who knows for sure .
Can I give you a piece of advice ?
I have a right to be happy .
Tom couldn &apos;t play the guitar .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his parents to find out that he was drunk .
I like being with Tom .
I know all I need to know .
It &apos;s very cold .
What was Tom &apos;s plan ?
&quot; Who helped you ? &quot; &quot; Tom did . &quot;
Tom has just started learning French .
Tom and I did that .
The rain changed to snow .
My family is living in Boston .
Tom is accustomed to hard work .
I &apos;m not mad . I &apos;m just disappointed .
I like this one .
I only have one question .
I can &apos;t forget her .
I &apos;m just too busy to take a vacation now .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
Be happy for me .
You &apos;ll never guess what Tom did .
I don &apos;t think I can do this without you .
They got married .
I don &apos;t want to ever speak to you again .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary what John did .
You &apos;ve done it !
Do you have any apples ?
The man is old .
Tom works very hard .
She is happy .
You must know Tom very well .
It seemed like a good idea .
Tom never was very interesting .
Tom says he &apos;s not going to do that .
Tom is the one who told me what to do .
It &apos;s a good thing .
People tell me I have a nice voice .
I know about Tom .
Mary is just as beautiful as Alice , I think .
Do you know the reason ?
You really don &apos;t know who that is , do you ?
He &apos;s my father .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
Everybody wants to be here .
Don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going on ?
We &apos;re getting it .
Tom comes from Boston .
Do you still have feelings for her ?
She &apos;s still young .
I still remember that very clearly .
They say that he is seriously ill .
He is far from rich .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom likes her .
I wonder what goes on inside Tom &apos;s head .
I &apos;m from Australia .
What are you doing now ?
What makes you happy ?
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
This is good news .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
I can &apos;t explain it any better than that . I wish I could .
It &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom always keeps his promises .
What time is it now ?
Tom asked for Mary &apos;s permission to leave early .
I &apos;ve already spoken to Tom .
When do you think you &apos;ll see Tom ?
This was not supposed to happen .
He pretended not to know me .
Tom has lots of friends to help him .
Are you really sick ?
Tom likes Mary , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
I definitely want to do that soon .
Go to sleep .
Don &apos;t mention this to Tom .
You may come if you like .
Who else is going with us ?
I can &apos;t reach it .
I thought I saw something .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
Tom speaks French better than he pretends to .
The food was very good .
Tom said he takes a walk every day .
He is as tall as my brother .
I &apos;m going to do that .
I feel safe here .
I wish I could cook as well as my mother .
It is impossible for me to help you .
You know her .
Tom is living in Boston .
You look like your father looked thirty years ago .
Thank you for helping Tom .
I believe anything is possible .
My watch is very precise .
It &apos;s only me .
We &apos;re about the same age .
It &apos;s not a secret anymore .
There won &apos;t be a choice .
Tom didn &apos;t catch any fish .
We like children .
We &apos;re doing what we want to do .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
Tom wanted to turn himself in .
That &apos;s not a proper thing to say .
I wanted to say hello to Tom .
All of us were silent .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
Why haven &apos;t you told Tom about what happened last night ?
Tom and Mary are gone .
Tom and Mary are playing tennis now .
I can &apos;t tell her now . It &apos;s not that simple anymore .
I think Tom can help .
Why did you buy another car ?
She stood by him .
I &apos;m very hungry now .
Do you have anything on for this weekend ?
You are a doctor .
Our company isn &apos;t very big .
This is a very good tea .
You can eat whatever you like .
This coffee is so hot that I can &apos;t drink it .
What did you do last night ?
I can &apos;t remember who I am .
I want to see what you have inside your house .
He no longer lives here .
I don &apos;t know what else to do .
Tom is never getting out of prison .
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
I have to study for the exam .
She understands him .
Tom seems to be eating all the time .
There &apos;s so much I want to say to you .
What time shall I come ?
You have to be careful .
There is an apple on the table .
Here you are , Tom .
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
All children do not like apples .
That &apos;s the only answer I can give .
I &apos;m almost finished .
Tom has started studying French again .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I made you coffee .
This is the man I told you about .
She walked very carefully .
Both of us want to see the movie .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bit cold .
I can &apos;t eat .
I &apos;m going to hurt you .
It seems interesting to me .
Tom knows what Mary is thinking .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with you ?
We &apos;ve done what we can .
I &apos;m not very hungry .
Why do you have this ?
I have to work .
I &apos;m sorry I have to go .
You have no right to tell me what to do .
Tom put on his glasses and began reading .
That &apos;s correct .
They know Tom .
I lost everything I had .
Tom seems sick .
We arrived at the station at five .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother ?
Where were you an hour ago ?
I said I &apos;d get it .
This is how the accident happened .
You can come .
Can &apos;t someone else do this ?
Don &apos;t you want to know where I was ?
It &apos;s more fun than studying .
I think we should do some more .
Tom is thinking about it .
It seems very interesting .
Your French is getting much better .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know that .
Tom won &apos;t do it .
I cannot afford to buy a new bicycle .
I don &apos;t care what you think of me .
She knows nothing about your family .
I don &apos;t believe anyone anymore .
Just let Tom go .
It has nothing to do with you .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows French .
Tell me what I need to know .
What do you want to hear ?
Tom pretended like it never happened .
There is no answer to your question .
He wore glasses .
You &apos;d better not go today .
Why &apos;d you do that ?
I hear from him once in a while .
I haven &apos;t read today &apos;s newspaper yet .
My father thinks that he &apos;s always right .
It &apos;s important to read a lot of books .
I like that , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I do .
Where did he learn this ?
I already know what happened .
You can lean on me .
Don &apos;t open this door .
Tom opened the book and started reading .
This is crazy .
We will talk over the matter later .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with Tom .
The boy has an apple in his pocket .
I &apos;m always hungry .
They want to know about Tom .
You don &apos;t have to go .
We raced toward the fire .
Tom is only pretending that he doesn &apos;t know .
Tom has to be here .
I think you should swim .
How &apos;s your French ?
Do you have a phone ?
Tom arrived ten minutes ago , but I haven &apos;t seen him yet .
Something &apos;s got to be done .
The tree was ready to fall down .
Which of you did it ?
You should &apos;ve been here .
No one likes war .
What will you make ?
Tom said he &apos;d be leaving soon .
Tom is able to speak French .
This could take hours .
We &apos;re all very worried about you .
We &apos;re not very good .
I asked Tom some questions .
We &apos;d better stop .
Where &apos;s the nearest train station ?
We have to go now .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along .
He can play tennis .
I want to know who &apos;s coming with us .
Tom is Mary &apos;s brother .
He &apos;s wearing a hat .
How is your family ?
She didn &apos;t say a word .
Give that back to me .
I hope we can make it to your party .
It makes my mouth water .
That &apos;s my dog .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come .
Tom did that a lot .
How &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
I would do anything for love .
I should &apos;ve apologized to Tom .
They adore Tom .
It may take a while .
You can &apos;t stay for long .
I don &apos;t understand a thing .
Ask Tom what he &apos;s done .
She spends a lot of money on shoes .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us the truth .
Tom is a good singer .
Tom could speak French .
He has a few friends .
What kind of person would do such a thing ?
Tom liked that .
This book was very interesting .
I didn &apos;t understand you .
This table is heavy .
We often hear French being spoken here .
You should get yourself a new car now .
Tom told me he had no time to read books .
Tom said he &apos;d be here .
That isn &apos;t what I meant .
Come and see me once in a while .
I saw the children walk across the street .
We were both hungry .
This question is not easy .
You &apos;ve gone too far .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
Tom is reading .
I &apos;d like you to assist Tom .
Why do I have to give this to you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like driving in the rain .
Can we sing ?
I have some food .
What are your weekend plans ?
That boy &apos;s name is Tom .
You can ask me anything you like .
He &apos;s sleeping like a baby .
I have to go now .
She herself helped him .
I like your hair .
Tom isn &apos;t helping .
I suspect he is ill .
They have lost a lot .
I asked Tom to wait for me at the train station .
I took off my shoes .
Tom never visited me in prison .
You are crazy .
I &apos;m doing this for them .
I don &apos;t know why they do it .
These flowers are for Mary , not for you .
We have to be there .
I am 30 years old now .
I don &apos;t believe in life after death .
I walked my dog .
I know I &apos;m good enough .
You should wait until Monday to do that .
Tom asked Mary if she would help him .
I hate this .
When was the last time that you did something for the first time ?
Tom and Mary continued looking at each other .
I don &apos;t want to be in your way .
You &apos;re not a doctor .
I want to be with you whenever I can .
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
You &apos;ve got to stop doing this .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
I could do nothing .
We &apos;re getting better and better .
How do I know it &apos;s you ?
I wish I hadn &apos;t gotten married so young .
I don &apos;t want to live like this .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
I had a little difficulty in getting a taxi .
Tom and Mary are together .
He sat down and read the paper .
I &apos;m so happy to finally be back home .
It sounds like you want to be alone .
I can afford it .
Tom &apos;s French has gotten better .
She wanted to help them .
Tom said he was glad he did that .
A cup of coffee , please .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
Tom is a bit older than Mary .
Where &apos;s my brother ?
Tom helps out as well .
Tom came home earlier than Mary expected .
I was at home .
Tom has a car .
You had better ask the doctor for advice .
That came in very handy , didn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ve got the money .
I know that Tom is tired .
Your French has gotten much better .
I &apos;ve just finished eating breakfast .
I don &apos;t think they would &apos;ve done anything .
That was Tom .
There &apos;s nothing I can do to change that .
I know where they &apos;re taking Tom .
I &apos;m not taking the bus .
You can &apos;t be thirty years old .
Are you really that busy ?
I &apos;ve already started to do that .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
Let &apos;s take the bus .
I &apos;d like you to meet my son .
You ought to find nice shoes here .
Tom needs you here .
Tom wasn &apos;t stupid .
What is love ?
I have to do that .
Tomorrow is her birthday .
Tom won &apos;t let me anywhere near Mary .
Were you speeding ?
I like snow .
You don &apos;t have to help .
Tom thinks he knows where to find Mary .
I &apos;ll never ever do that again .
I thought Tom had a dog .
I can play tennis .
She seems to be in love with my brother .
Tom wants a watch like yours .
They do it each week .
I don &apos;t like what he said .
We &apos;re young .
Are those new shoes ?
Why didn &apos;t you call us ?
What are you thinking ?
Tom made a mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
I wrote this letter in French .
You didn &apos;t call me .
Aren &apos;t these your books ?
We had a lot of snow last year .
I &apos;m a student .
No one here has a car .
I feel like eating out tonight .
She looks just like my sister .
I wonder why Tom has been so nice to me recently .
He has two dogs .
What are you wearing ?
You have to go to the party .
How are you holding up ?
Where &apos;s my bag ?
I &apos;ll never go out with Tom again .
I &apos;ve got good news .
I got on the train for London .
No matter how busy you are , you have to do your homework .
Where can we meet you ?
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
I can &apos;t carry this suitcase by myself .
Tom thinks what I did was wrong .
I don &apos;t want to lose Tom .
Please drop in on your way home .
Who do you think will win ?
No one seems to listen to us anymore .
We can &apos;t do it .
I can &apos;t marry Tom .
I hate this job .
She &apos;s not young , is she ?
Are you busy now ?
There &apos;s no one in the house . They &apos;re all outside .
I &apos;m supposed to see Tom .
Ask me again in October .
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It seems that I &apos;ve lost my keys .
My homework was finally finished .
I haven &apos;t had dinner .
We will be happy to help .
I had to stay in bed for a while .
I got it .
Tom didn &apos;t take his own life .
No one understands me like you do .
He was underwater for three minutes .
I &apos;m not good at singing .
I guess I &apos;d better get back to work .
I &apos;d like to be alone now .
Did you give Tom my phone number ?
How did you come to know this ?
It is time to go .
They saw Tom .
He may have been ill .
Nobody spoke with me .
I &apos;m going .
The cat sleeps next to the couch .
He never said it again .
I think I &apos;d like to do that .
Tom and Mary continued to look at each other .
I &apos;d like to hear your opinion .
Have you eaten dinner ?
Tom is waiting there for you .
I thought about my family .
Tom is going to live with us .
Did you study French yesterday ?
I forgot to ask Tom for his advice .
Tom &apos;s busy .
Get Tom to help you .
Tom didn &apos;t go alone .
Tom is probably dead .
I wish we could live here .
Tom didn &apos;t ask me to do anything .
That cannot be true .
It &apos;s close by .
When do you return home ?
Tom talked .
Where &apos;s Tom when you need him ?
I like learning ancient languages .
What I think doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom seems happy .
I &apos;m asking what you think .
She took the book back to the library .
I eat meat .
He &apos;s getting up early .
The baby appeared to be sleeping quietly .
Do you have any objection ?
Where does Tom do that ?
I don &apos;t understand French .
Can you leave it with me till this afternoon ?
She got married to him .
Tom wanted to see it .
Tom doesn &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
How kind of you !
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
We &apos;re back where we started .
What he said made us angry .
Tom told Mary the whole story .
You don &apos;t look like Tom .
I said nothing about the matter .
Tom knows about that .
I don &apos;t want to lose you again .
I &apos;ll do it myself .
I think I could help .
Do you want to do this ?
We &apos;re late for school .
Tom hardly ever eats meat anymore .
He is having lunch .
I cannot quite understand it .
Nobody ever came to see me in the hospital .
Tom spoke only French .
You &apos;re probably the only person who can help me do that .
Tom isn &apos;t in jail anymore .
Tom will answer all of your questions .
Tom is almost as tall as you are .
Tom , Mary and John are all here .
No one ever saw such a thing .
Why wait until Monday ?
Do you enjoy working from home ?
Tom made me promise not to tell Mary his phone number .
What didn &apos;t you understand ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
Did you invite Tom to dinner ?
You were drunk , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom lives near us .
Let me know what I can do to help .
I think I know what to say .
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents about us ?
Is what you told me secret ?
We already ate .
I think that &apos;s where Tom is now .
Here &apos;s what we want .
Is what you said about Tom really true ?
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow .
They &apos;ll know .
You &apos;re the one I love .
We &apos;ve already eaten .
I &apos;m just asking .
Is there anything else you want me to do ?
There &apos;s no one there .
Tom , I &apos;m doing this for you .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
She has the large house to herself .
The dictionary on the desk is mine .
All of them swim very fast .
This house is very big , isn &apos;t it ?
She requested help , but no one came .
Mary and I plan to have two children .
He &apos;s about the same age as you .
He left immediately .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Have you been married for a long time ?
This is a very busy station .
Tom isn &apos;t coming , either .
I love books .
I &apos;m not ready .
Tom is from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m proud of my children .
Is that a new car ?
I will never be your friend .
Tom knows that .
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
Perhaps Tom will do that , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that very often anymore .
You &apos;ll find this book very interesting .
I don &apos;t like it when it &apos;s very hot .
It wasn &apos;t hard to understand .
Let &apos;s go see Tom .
I can do it by myself .
I don &apos;t like to do that when it &apos;s raining .
It &apos;s really cold today .
Tom came too early .
I do think so .
He had fun with her .
They &apos;re all older than you .
What do you do when you don &apos;t have time to eat lunch ?
There was nothing for me to drink .
We get along really well .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s true that she &apos;s dead .
She has not come here yet .
Tom was really tired .
I asked Tom where he &apos;d been .
We &apos;ve got everything we need .
I &apos;ve got time .
Tom said he enjoyed the party .
This room has three windows .
These are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
I can &apos;t imagine a day without you .
Can I get your help with something ?
I have a computer .
Summer has arrived at last .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me much about it .
I can &apos;t make a decision on my own .
He can come .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
Have you ever played with Tom &apos;s dog ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any children .
I don &apos;t know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Are you sure you can afford this ?
Kids like to play .
Could you carry this box for me , please ?
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle .
It was so cold that I couldn &apos;t sleep .
Shut the door .
You should keep your promise .
Don &apos;t be late for school .
Don &apos;t be a fool .
I like dogs very much .
I don &apos;t care what you think .
Take good care of yourself .
Tom has a very nice voice .
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours .
We may be too late .
Tom &apos;s very nice .
Without air and water , we would not be able to live .
I &apos;ll stand by you no matter what others may say .
I have a dog and a cat .
What makes you think that ?
I hope you win .
It all makes sense .
Tom knows about this , doesn &apos;t he ?
You must not open the door .
Tom is just pretending .
I &apos;m not certain what to do .
He tried it with a friend .
I told you Tom wouldn &apos;t want to go .
You can only use it once .
Where did you and Tom first meet ?
Let &apos;s talk outside .
Nobody is doing anything .
Can I count on you to do that ?
You should wait until Monday to do that .
I don &apos;t want to play tennis this afternoon .
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
The room is full of flowers .
I want to know more about you , Tom .
Nothing &apos;s going on .
They are happy .
He can speak 10 languages .
You have to believe me .
Are you ready to talk about it ?
Do you know what he has done ?
The story cannot be true .
Tom will take care of that for us .
Tom and Mary have a second home .
Shall I come to your office ?
It &apos;s almost impossible .
I couldn &apos;t stand .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
They &apos;re friends .
You don &apos;t have to come .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
My mother is in the hospital now .
The weather is bad , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom is currently living in Australia .
I forget your telephone number .
It wasn &apos;t clear what she meant .
He &apos;s old and crazy .
You must be crazy .
I took it .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have liked that .
The piano is expensive .
Why does everybody love cats ?
Tom gave me that book .
I enjoyed it a lot .
They aren &apos;t happy .
What is it you really want to tell me ?
I &apos;d rather do something else .
Tom would &apos;ve helped us .
I can &apos;t imagine life without you .
Tom was invited .
The word is not in my dictionary .
That is all right .
Tom told Mary that she was right .
I don &apos;t think that I &apos;ll be able to solve this problem by myself .
They should know it .
Would you like to have another beer ?
Tom is going home .
How could Tom possibly know that ?
Get me some , too .
Maybe we should wait until Tom gets here .
There is no time to lose .
It &apos;s only three o &apos;clock .
I need to buy one .
You can &apos;t imagine how busy I was .
This thing isn &apos;t over yet .
I &apos;m not angry at all of you .
We have a job to do .
I &apos;d like to be alone if you don &apos;t mind .
I &apos;m getting good at this .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t have children .
Is this your money ?
To make a long story short , we married .
I think I &apos;ll like being here .
He appeared young .
I received her letter last week .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
We need each other .
I &apos;m going to take this .
I am fine .
I don &apos;t want to say anything .
I &apos;m taking it with me .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
I see that .
I &apos;m looking forward to getting your letter .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
I told her to sit down and to drink a glass of water .
What do you think of my new hat ?
When did you buy that ?
How long did you work for Tom ?
All the boys are the same age .
Is Tom the one who told you that ?
Tom appears nervous .
I haven &apos;t done very much this year .
I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
I bought this for my girlfriend .
Most people think I &apos;m crazy .
I &apos;m here looking for Tom .
We &apos;ll start .
Where have you been all evening ?
Let us know if you &apos;re coming .
I &apos;ll show you around the town .
See you next week !
The car is not available today .
What are the two of you doing ?
Can you explain that to me ?
We &apos;re not watching .
We all like him .
Tom ate one apple and Mary ate the other .
I can &apos;t believe you did all this without any help .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a telephone .
That was to be expected .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
He makes fun of everybody .
The meeting has already begun .
We &apos;re reading .
I love you more than her .
He stayed at the hotel for two days .
I don &apos;t believe I caught your name .
I don &apos;t like kids .
He laid aside a few dollars each week .
I learned a lot this weekend .
He sat on the bed .
Did Tom ask about us ?
Why is Tom not helping Mary ?
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
I &apos;ll be back in a couple minutes .
I can &apos;t stay here anymore .
When are you coming to Boston ?
I plan to speak with Tom about that .
We tried really hard .
Tom might still be living in Australia .
Women don &apos;t like Tom .
I can &apos;t do it that fast .
I &apos;m glad to hear of your success .
I will never see him .
We &apos;re already old .
I have one in the car .
You have no idea what happened , do you ?
Do you have a TV ?
What does he see ?
It &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
Have you been in Boston long ?
Tom was at home .
There &apos;s nothing going on between Tom and Mary .
Tom had no time to waste .
I know your brother very well .
He &apos;ll be here soon .
Tom will find somebody .
I won &apos;t say anything to anyone .
The problem was too much for me .
I couldn &apos;t help myself .
I forgot Tom spoke French .
I will help as much as I can .
What do you like about it ?
I know people .
They saw me .
Tom was really mad .
This is your big chance .
Tom seemed nice .
What in the world got into you ?
He easily gets angry .
I hope it &apos;s not Tom .
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition .
Tom didn &apos;t have any other choice .
Tom has enough time .
I had to go there alone .
I &apos;ll be happy to go .
Tom said he &apos;d come tomorrow .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
That &apos;s really weird .
The coffee is very hot .
Tom is afraid of Mary .
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
I walked to school .
Tom has been working all day long .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
Can &apos;t anything be done ?
I never thought I would get married .
I want Tom to know that .
Tom wants to go , too .
Is this wine ?
I &apos;m not saying that .
I don &apos;t want to sleep .
I love you a lot .
A cab is waiting .
I hope Tom never gets out of prison .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to dance .
I met him just now .
I asked Tom not to tell Mary .
Tom is liked by everyone .
I know that Tom was at your house today .
I want to see it for myself .
She was listening to music .
You have one hour to get this done .
What is the matter with you ?
You should go .
I &apos;ll stay here as long as I can .
That man is Tom .
Tom wants to see you in his office .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like this .
I have a lot of things to tell you .
Tom looked old .
I just can &apos;t wait to get home .
What Tom really wanted was a new guitar .
Tom knows that he has a choice to make .
He was to have called her up , but he forgot .
We just want to have a few questions answered .
He bought a car .
I &apos;ll always remember the first time I saw Tom .
This story cannot be true .
What &apos;s wrong with you , Tom ?
Are you still married to Tom ?
He rode his bicycle there .
When &apos;ll we know how Tom is ?
I see a book .
I &apos;d like to apologize for this morning .
I gave Tom a book .
If you &apos;d just asked me , I would &apos;ve done it .
We have one for you , too .
I can afford one , but not both .
When should we come to Boston ?
When will dinner be ready ?
It was her that told me .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
I didn &apos;t think you were going to make it .
You could &apos;ve answered that question .
Tom sat down next to his brother .
Not all of us can speak English .
You know I &apos;m married .
You can stay here as long as you want .
He must be Tom &apos;s brother .
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
Right now I &apos;m at the airport .
Tom said he &apos;d had nothing to do with what had happened .
I &apos;ve worked three hours already .
I don &apos;t know what they think .
She accepted his gift .
What &apos;s up with Tom ?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow .
You should probably go .
Dinner is ready to eat .
Is it all paid for ?
What are you going to do about this ?
They know Tom .
Are you alone right now ?
Tom takes a walk every morning .
Did you find your book ?
How come you know French so well ?
We &apos;re going to do it again .
I have to visit Tom .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
We &apos;ve found it .
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
I &apos;m not asking Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is happy or not .
I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
Why is that ?
They accept students like Tom .
I just can ’ t stop .
Tom is working .
I don &apos;t think Tom tried hard enough .
You have to answer the question .
Tom , there &apos;s something you should know about me .
Tom ran away with the money .
It &apos;s time you went to bed .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s watch .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Isn &apos;t that what really matters ?
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
I knew that was Tom .
No one knows his name .
Everything is now ready for you .
Tom asked for Mary &apos;s help .
I can read without glasses .
Were you playing tennis yesterday morning ?
Please don &apos;t let go of my hand .
Tom admitted that he had stolen money from Mary .
I &apos;ll let you know when it has been decided .
Has Tom ever asked you to help him ?
That book &apos;s mine .
I &apos;m much older than you think I am .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
I have never seen anyone like him .
I wish I were rich .
I found these .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
They &apos;ve taken Tom .
It happened again , didn &apos;t it ?
I worry about him .
You drive .
Tom says he always told Mary the truth .
I &apos;m very cold .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom can do that .
He was sitting and reading a book .
Tom lost his wife seven years ago .
&quot; Where is my phone ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on my desk . &quot;
What did you eat for breakfast ?
How &apos;s the water ?
Here comes Tom .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
Tom wants to make Mary happy .
I want to see you in my office .
You need to help me find Tom .
Don &apos;t you want me there ?
We are expecting a baby .
I &apos;m not hurt .
He was injured in the accident .
Tom is too good for you .
Tom should &apos;ve done that weeks ago .
Tom speaks very slowly .
I &apos;ve been told that often enough .
Can we believe that ?
What do you want me to do for you ?
Business is business .
You look like your dad .
I must be out of my mind .
How did you get Tom to do that for you ?
Everyone felt sorry for Tom .
He was home alone at the time .
I want to talk to the doctor .
Tom is better today than yesterday .
Speaking English is difficult .
The boy caught a large fish .
You can never tell how long these meetings will last .
Tom is Mary &apos;s father .
Tom wasn &apos;t like that .
You &apos;ve got my phone .
You can wait here .
I think that that book is not so interesting .
I want you to stop singing .
I admit that he is right .
Return this book as soon as you can .
Tom is my mother &apos;s brother .
Your name is Tom , correct ?
You &apos;ll lose everything .
Can you please tell me how I can get to the beach ?
I couldn &apos;t remember anything .
It &apos;s not always like that .
Let me see that .
Tom went downtown .
This is how you do it .
If Tom can &apos;t tell me , then no one can .
The others are playing outside .
We don &apos;t have to read that .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t going to be the one driving .
We didn &apos;t do anything .
Tom is seldom home .
Mary is not my type .
Let me ask you something .
These two things are completely unrelated .
He is able to play the guitar .
I will speak to you tomorrow .
I should have done this weeks ago .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how tall Mary is .
Tom isn &apos;t one of us .
He is not angry anymore .
What will you wear ?
That has nothing to do with you .
Can you show me ?
Tom and Mary are students .
Is this your picture ?
You guys need new shoes .
I have to call Tom .
I need to buy one .
Is Tom at home now ?
You didn &apos;t eat much lunch , did you ?
I &apos;m a teacher .
Why did you do that ?
I wasn &apos;t even there .
Tell Tom I &apos;m not hungry .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand .
Don &apos;t you want me to be happy ?
Tom is walking towards Mary .
Do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
There &apos;s so much I want to show you .
I &apos;ve got as much money as he has .
We need to be very careful .
Don &apos;t go , Tom .
Tom can also speak a little French .
What &apos;re we looking for ?
I always have time for you .
Is someone here ?
He doesn &apos;t take vacations .
Let &apos;s begin on page 30 .
I don &apos;t want to be in your way .
I hope Tom knows .
I &apos;m not telling you .
Hasn &apos;t this happened before ?
I went by bus as far as London .
Tom got to work later than usual this morning . I wonder why .
You know that .
They won &apos;t find you .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
Tom knows how to do this .
I should &apos;ve listened to my mother .
Tom knows the way .
You need a vacation .
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
I should be making lunch .
No one will believe us .
Tom is happy here .
Tom asked everyone questions .
My mother speaks slowly .
Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
Tom was looking quite happy .
You should leave at once .
You could do that .
How old do you think Tom is ?
I think Tom was supposed to be here .
Tom goes to school with my daughter .
I invited him over to my place .
Tom intends to become a teacher .
I &apos;ll be coming back tonight .
Tom died at a relatively young age .
Tom has been here three years .
It &apos;s said that he knows the secret .
It was very cold yesterday morning .
Tom has to make a decision .
The big question is why .
Tom has located Mary .
Tom has no right to say that .
Tom told me a long story .
Tom despised Mary .
I thought you told me you couldn &apos;t speak French .
I paid .
I don &apos;t know if he would have done it for me .
Tom didn &apos;t need it .
Tom believed me .
Tom is only pretending to be sick .
I &apos;m seeing them tonight .
Where did Tom eat ?
I hardly ever walk to work .
I thought you said Tom was dangerous .
Don &apos;t look at us .
I would like to move to Australia .
I can do this .
Can we believe them ?
Have you finished reading the book ?
The children are already tired .
It wasn &apos;t that funny .
Tom has been gone for a few days .
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
I &apos;d like to see them both .
Have you found something ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I didn &apos;t know you were that kind of a person .
Did you do it by yourself ?
If you are hungry , why don &apos;t you eat ?
You cannot live by love alone .
Take a bus .
I &apos;m not eating this .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
I saw it , too .
I figured you should know .
I saw her again .
Tom took my car .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
Were they here ?
You did that really well .
She invited her friends to dinner .
Is this what you want me to do ?
How stupid of me !
Tom ought to win .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home .
This is Tom &apos;s school .
If I &apos;d taken that plane , I wouldn &apos;t be alive now .
Tom lives there .
How did you make it ?
I was out for a walk .
Tom enjoyed himself a lot at the party .
Tom copies everything I do .
What do you want me to do ?
Your daughter isn &apos;t a girl anymore .
Tom made me go there .
He is one of my best friends .
You both love each other , don &apos;t you ?
You had better go at once .
He intends to buy a new bicycle .
Tom didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
I &apos;ll wait till four o &apos;clock .
Are these Tom &apos;s shoes ?
You need to wake up .
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
You &apos;re wounded .
Tom and I became good friends .
We came to see you .
Tom left after me .
Tom knows what to do .
It &apos;s ten o &apos;clock sharp .
No one really knows .
Tom was surprised when Mary caught a fish .
My uncle comes back from America next Monday .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
Tom will remain at home .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without your help .
I saw one .
I know that Tom was right .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to go ?
How do you know what I &apos;m thinking ?
I will go swimming tomorrow .
Let me speak to Tom first .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go to Boston .
You &apos;d better go home .
The ball &apos;s in your court .
I haven &apos;t told anyone , not even Tom .
I didn &apos;t know what else to say to Tom .
We study French at school every day .
They aren &apos;t all bad .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
I don &apos;t think Tom can be left alone .
You have to tell me the truth .
She gave him some food .
I may be able to help you .
About how much money do you have ?
Tom has lost his keys .
She does not do things like that .
Will you let me try once more ?
Let me win for once .
Remove your hat .
Nobody did anything .
I don &apos;t like doing this .
Look into my eyes .
We can &apos;t help that .
I have no money today .
Tom is paid to do that .
Do you want anything to eat ?
Tom wanted to wear his new shoes .
I &apos;m really looking forward to meeting Tom .
I have to speak with Tom .
May I help you ?
I have no idea what Tom said .
I &apos;m used to waiting .
My name isn &apos;t Tom . It &apos;s John .
We sometimes meet them .
You should go to bed early .
You look just like your father .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
Have you found anything ?
Let Tom sleep .
Tom made it for me .
We just got here .
Don &apos;t leave them alone .
How long has he lived in London ?
It can be used as a knife .
Are you busy these days ?
Tom is after me .
We &apos;re friends .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
Tom tried to get Mary to help John .
I can &apos;t imagine that &apos;s true .
Look at your hands .
There are two cats sleeping on the bed .
His brother passed away last month .
Tom isn &apos;t the one who needs help .
You wouldn &apos;t want that to happen , would you ?
Did you ask Tom why he wasn &apos;t at the meeting ?
We have two children .
I &apos;m very pleased to have met you .
What happened ?
I &apos;m tired already .
Tom might walk to school tomorrow .
I had to stay in bed all day .
Do you want to talk ?
I know that &apos;s not true .
I &apos;ll never understand men .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re right .
This is what I have to do .
I &apos;d like to show you something .
I am happy .
I hate the winter .
When will it begin ?
How did you get into the house ?
Would you like to go to Boston with me next summer ?
That happens all the time .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
I like going to Boston .
They &apos;ve gone .
Do you expect me to believe that ?
You &apos;ve tried .
Where is your friend from ?
I must see it .
I will explain it to her .
Tom &apos;s girlfriend saw him with another girl .
I don &apos;t think Tom is capable of doing that .
Tom seems to be waiting for someone .
I &apos;m sorry about what I said .
The bus left five minutes ahead of time .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I wonder whether Tom will help us .
She is old .
I didn &apos;t write anything .
The boy talks as if he were a man .
I actually did that yesterday .
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday .
I thought Mary loved me .
Can you make it on time ?
Can I open the window ?
We won &apos;t tell anyone .
There is nothing to apologize for .
How much did you pay for the dress ?
Do you have a TV ?
What were you doing there ?
I have one brother .
Are you through with your homework ?
Would you like me to explain it to you ?
Today isn &apos;t my birthday .
How was it ?
Take mine .
Where did you learn to speak French ?
Do you want to go somewhere else ?
Tom is going to be happy here .
He deserves to know the truth .
I went to school there .
Is it new ?
Who could forget it ?
I couldn &apos;t believe what I was seeing .
How long &apos;s that going to take ?
I can &apos;t afford a camera as good as yours .
Tom has too many books .
He appeared on TV last night .
Is this book yours ?
She must be angry .
What should I do now ?
Tom made three errors .
Everybody &apos;s talking .
Who &apos;s after you ?
This is my kitchen .
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out .
Did Tom say that ?
When do you usually go to bed ?
We need to find someone who can take care of this problem .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I might be a few minutes late .
You must not stay here .
She shouldn &apos;t go by herself .
He &apos;s not home .
Tom looks young .
We &apos;re not going home .
Why are you reading this ?
Aren &apos;t you hungry ?
Did you understand what he said ?
I don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
What does it look like ?
We found it here .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about this .
What do you expect me to do ?
Tom has to be home by 2 : 30 .
That doesn &apos;t cut the mustard .
I &apos;m feeling good this morning .
You know the way , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m at the restaurant .
Is that what I think it is ?
Tom is a good friend .
I &apos;m nervous , too .
This car is as big as that car .
It &apos;s been ages since we last met .
Are you at Tom &apos;s place ?
My mother has been sick for two days .
Why didn &apos;t you come by bus ?
Tom studies after dinner .
Tom does want to do that .
I am tired of the work .
Tom blames us .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
He wished he had more time .
He &apos;s good .
You should &apos;ve heard Tom sing . He was really good .
That won &apos;t be possible .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
We need to get out of here .
Is there a woman in your life ?
I don &apos;t want to spend any more time in Boston .
I usually get home just before 2 : 30 .
That &apos;s quite possible .
I had a hard time finding his house .
I can &apos;t even do that .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I never said anything like that .
I don &apos;t like studying .
Tom listened to music in his room until late at night .
I &apos;m very good at it .
There is much more to be done .
This book is interesting to read .
I was invited .
What did you expect ?
Tom understands French .
Just let Tom go .
How many times have I told you ?
Who found Tom ?
I &apos;m not your husband anymore .
I have lost my key .
She lost her money , her family and her friends .
We &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t have time to finish his report .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like you .
Have you made your decision yet ?
You need friends .
Did somebody get hurt ?
You must be from Australia .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
Finding work wasn &apos;t easy .
I think I can do it .
This is Tom &apos;s book .
Let &apos;s eat out tonight .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait .
I &apos;ll come here again tomorrow .
I almost dropped my sandwich .
Let &apos;s skip lunch .
You can &apos;t sit with me .
This morning the weather was so bad that I had to take a taxi .
It &apos;s not my fault .
I didn &apos;t know Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom doesn &apos;t gamble .
Everyone is happy .
Tom has been pretending to be me .
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
What kind of teacher do you want to be ?
You &apos;ll never change .
Tom put on his glasses .
Why aren &apos;t you sitting down ?
That would be fine .
I can &apos;t say I &apos;m surprised .
I &apos;m not sure actually .
What more can be said ?
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom .
You never told me you had a sister .
I liked this movie .
You will be able to see him tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
Tom let Mary do whatever she wanted to do .
Everything here is mine .
You can go home if you like .
That &apos;s what you said the last time .
Tom is in love with you .
I think you should do it .
Tom was contented .
I &apos;ll work on that .
I am at home every evening .
What good does that do us ?
I &apos;ve never heard of that city .
I can &apos;t leave .
We always have to pay more .
He took me by the hand .
We go to school because we want to learn .
What did he do yesterday ?
Did Tom call you last night ?
I don &apos;t know what this is .
What does this have to do with me ?
Tom thought about Mary a lot .
That &apos;s a really big apple .
They &apos;ll like it .
Tom thought you said yes .
Are you injured ?
I think Tom is sleeping .
Why are we still here ?
I think I &apos;ve forgotten something .
Let me explain it once more , so you understand what I mean .
What &apos;s your cat &apos;s name ?
I think Tom is out .
Hand me that bag .
Tom looked into Mary &apos;s eyes .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
If I were in your place , I would lend him a hand .
I &apos;m able to speak French .
I want to ask you some questions .
You &apos;ll never guess what Tom did .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what Mary did .
I know how difficult it is for you to believe me .
It &apos;s for you .
I &apos;ve got to speak to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t belong here .
My apartment is in that building .
Don &apos;t brag .
I want to study French .
I don &apos;t understand this question at all .
It &apos;s not worth it .
Tom told me that he wanted to study French .
It &apos;s not your problem , anyway .
We &apos;re not as young as Tom .
Tom came with me .
We &apos;ve been through this before .
It &apos;s been three years since I &apos;ve been to Boston .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
Go look for it .
Tom is leaving .
Tom said that , too .
I won &apos;t be home for a week .
He looks tired this evening .
Nobody believes what I say .
I have friends .
I need to ask you to leave .
We don &apos;t need to go to school tomorrow .
I can &apos;t make out what she said .
You &apos;re really tall , aren &apos;t you ?
You can say that again .
I know what Tom does here .
He has not been able to attend school for a week .
I &apos;m wounded .
I have no other choice .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that today .
What time is dinner ?
He will not go .
I have a lot of friends here .
Are you the one who wrote this ?
Aren &apos;t you new here ?
I can &apos;t recall all their names .
I saw your light was on and knew you were still awake .
That pretty girl is my sister .
Where &apos;s Tom going to be ?
I like the dog .
The baby was quiet all night .
Did you read them ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
You know Tom doesn &apos;t like that .
Everybody knows we don &apos;t like each other .
He plays tennis every day .
Tom looks young for his age .
What &apos;s it like in Boston ?
He seems to be very fond of the boy .
I don &apos;t know why Tom needs that much money .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
Go away .
I &apos;ve never had to do anything like this before .
Playing in the street is dangerous .
Tom realized that Mary was right .
I got my son to repair the door .
If that guitar were not so expensive , I could buy it .
I &apos;ll take care of the dog while you are out .
Come back in an hour .
Who invited you to the party ?
We know what needs to be done .
I don &apos;t want to work here anymore .
Have you eaten supper yet ?
You &apos;d better stay here .
Tom had only three dollars with him .
They all look the same to me .
I &apos;m very glad I wasn &apos;t there .
I wonder whether Tom is nervous or not .
Tom is pretty good at everything .
What do you want me to do about Tom ?
It &apos;s your decision .
She says she will call you later .
There are a lot of people here .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with Tom ?
Your French is getting much better .
Tom is too tired to study .
That could be dangerous .
He &apos;s afraid that he might be late .
Tom can swim , but Mary can &apos;t .
I &apos;ve invited all my friends .
I &apos;m not your brother .
They look alike to me .
Tom wants you to do it .
Tom and Mary are looking for John .
Why did you go to Boston ?
Why do you think Tom doesn &apos;t like it ?
What actually happened ?
I want to know all about you .
What &apos;s your feeling about the idea ?
The work was very difficult .
You &apos;d like it .
I just want to know what happened .
Let &apos;s just have some fun .
I need French for my job .
Please don &apos;t open this window .
We eat so that we can live .
My uncle has made me what I am today .
You better go .
Tom said Mary was his daughter .
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
I &apos;m afraid Tom won &apos;t be able to come .
It should be possible to change that .
Why did you listen to them ?
It was too late .
This work must be finished by tomorrow .
I &apos;d like to be alone if you don &apos;t mind .
Where have you been this week ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like working in the garden .
Tom came by himself .
Don &apos;t kid yourself .
That &apos;s the one we want .
Do you know where Tom works ?
You already paid .
He has been in Japan for three years .
Tell me what you want me to do .
I &apos;m just looking .
I can &apos;t say that .
It &apos;ll be very , very hot .
I just want to go to sleep .
I know your son .
We &apos;ll stop here for today .
Is it time ?
What shall we do today ?
Has Tom called yet ?
We studied English .
Ask Tom what he &apos;s done .
Women are all the same .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary &apos;s help .
I love my friends .
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea ?
Men rarely talk about their problems .
I am a student , but he isn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t see Tom &apos;s car .
I didn &apos;t need Tom &apos;s money .
He won &apos;t be in time for the meeting .
You &apos;ll like this .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
He watches TV every day .
Tom didn &apos;t tell the truth .
He was absent from school for a week .
How are you now ?
Thank you for your advice .
Tom sat down on the bed next to Mary .
I lost my camera .
Tom has a new girlfriend .
She was absorbed in her work .
Would you join me for a walk ?
Are you new ?
Tom won &apos;t ever forget what happened today .
Your life is in danger .
We can &apos;t help you .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who did that .
You may go if you choose .
Tom should take better care of his children .
Did Tom say where Mary might be ?
I don &apos;t even know if Tom is still alive .
I want a friend .
Tom is a good student , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom was really crazy .
They pay Tom well .
Turn it off .
I don &apos;t understand a word of what you &apos;re saying .
How come you ask ?
I only know him by name .
What else did you see ?
He thinks only about himself .
You are rich .
I was asked to fix the bicycle .
Everyone made fun of me .
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t speak to you .
What can you give me ?
I thought you said Tom was dead .
We &apos;re asking you not to do that .
Tom will speak .
Tom knows that Mary likes him .
I want to have a job that I love .
Tom needed food .
She is beautiful .
I think Tom knew .
I &apos;ve forgotten where I put my passport .
I think Tom likes his job .
Tom looked at Mary , but said nothing .
Tom cannot drive .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
Tom told me not to talk to you .
We have to look after our parents .
I need to know by tomorrow .
I think the train will come soon .
Tom can run fast .
The man that I see is very tall .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
I think it would be a mistake to do that .
What &apos;s so funny ?
Tom and Mary were hungry .
I want to talk to him .
I don &apos;t think that Tom is asleep now .
Tom was out of town last week .
Could you bring me something to eat ?
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I can tell you that it didn &apos;t happen .
It &apos;s time for you to go to bed .
Close the door .
What &apos;s the point of not eating ?
Thanks for inviting me .
Are you angry with me ?
I want to know where Tom is .
Maybe you should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
You look happy today .
Tom was listening .
Who was the book written by ?
Tom is just like us .
Tom sat down .
Have you met Tom &apos;s new girlfriend ?
I turned to him for advice .
Tom stayed there for three years .
I &apos;m very surprised .
Tom went to his room and sat down on his bed .
Aren &apos;t you hungry ?
We can do much better .
Tom is in a good mood .
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
It gets quite cold in the winter .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know the answer .
The teacher gave us homework .
She needs him more than he needs her .
Have him come .
Have you ever been there ?
How did Tom and Mary meet ?
What do you call this fish in English ?
If I were rich , I would do so . As it is , I can do nothing .
It was cold .
Tom made this for me .
She was approaching thirty when I first met her .
I &apos;m going to take tomorrow off .
Is this mine ?
You can use my desk if you want .
How much does Tom spend a month ?
Give that back to me .
You should go home now .
Tom is invited .
Tom knows exactly what kind of person Mary is .
What did you find ?
What are you going to do this evening ?
Can you please tell me what time the train leaves ?
Tom is like my brother .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
I can solve this problem .
You give up too easily .
Give me your keys .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always been .
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem .
Tom has a right to know the truth .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
I need to speak with you right away .
She speaks quickly .
You must know yourself .
Tom never wears a hat .
I am no longer a child .
English is difficult to learn .
I don &apos;t understand women .
Tom needs new clothes .
I &apos;d rather not go home .
I wish you had let Tom go with us .
He came about two .
I have no idea what that is .
I go to work by bus .
Tom took one last look around the room before he left .
Tom &apos;s finished .
You &apos;ll do fine , Tom .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
Tom knows his way around Boston .
What do you want to know ?
They are all college students .
Tom asked Mary to leave the room .
I never do that .
He cannot afford a holiday .
Tom asked Mary to help me .
Why did you do that ?
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
How bad do you want this job ?
You know where Tom is .
He has no house in which to live .
He pretended to be my friend .
You won &apos;t remember a thing .
We can &apos;t pretend it never happened .
I &apos;d love to see you .
Tom never stops .
Why don &apos;t you go out ?
Lunch is on .
I want to become a doctor .
My father is home .
I am not hungry .
When did you come to Japan ?
Tom and I enjoy singing together .
Tom is in need of help .
No one &apos;s home .
Tom asked for my number .
It can &apos;t be true .
You know your stuff .
I wonder why he is so angry .
I &apos;m so sorry for what I did .
I had no idea you were here .
Tom must &apos;ve seen Mary there .
Put that fire out .
What do you love ? What don &apos;t you love ?
He can &apos;t cook very well .
Don &apos;t take everything so seriously .
I have nothing to do with the matter .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
Tom has a job .
I can &apos;t find my shoes .
It &apos;s a problem .
Tom wants to be a doctor .
It happens .
Why do you think they like it ?
I simply don &apos;t believe you .
Everyone likes them .
I want to see what you have inside your house .
Tom left , leaving Mary alone with John .
We &apos;re not crazy .
Why do you walk when you have a car ?
I asked Tom a question .
I &apos;ll explain the matter to you later on .
I can read them all .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
Let me know once you &apos;ve decided when you &apos;ll come .
What are you trying to say ?
We &apos;ll soon find out .
Are they your friends ?
When do you return home ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to do that ?
You have a good camera .
When will we reach the airport ?
No one wanted to be seen with Tom .
Tom was injured .
He has more books than I do .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him .
Tom and I &apos;ve decided to get married .
I want a book to read .
Tom accepted my present .
Would you like to have some coffee ?
Tom showed Mary around the city .
Tom runs very fast .
Tom would &apos;ve helped you .
Tom knows where I am .
I &apos;ve been doing it for years .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t even know why I don &apos;t like him .
I don &apos;t know how I did that .
Thanks for doing that .
Do you know what that means ?
Why does everything happen to me ?
It would be better for you to stay away from such a man .
I &apos;m going to try .
May I use this telephone ?
Someone took my stuff .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
I have no friends to help me .
I know what I &apos;m saying .
Tom will be at home until noon .
Is this your phone ?
Tom gave an apple to the teacher .
This happens all the time .
They are disappointed in their son .
What &apos;s it worth to you ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for days .
It &apos;s quite simple .
The decision is yours .
Why did that matter ?
Did you find anything in the room ?
None of your business .
What are you going to do with that ?
We have a big dog .
Tom introduced Mary to his family .
Don &apos;t look at Tom . Look at me .
She came home very late .
My sister was a beautiful woman .
What are we looking for ?
Tom didn &apos;t look at the picture again .
Are these your own books ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom said .
I &apos;m sure Tom loves you .
We can &apos;t change what has happened .
I have a new plan .
Please don &apos;t tell anyone about this .
Tom left his keys with me .
She really likes cats a lot .
I told Tom .
I don &apos;t believe everything Tom says .
Tom made a good speech .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how strong you are .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
How do you like your new car ?
Did you learn that from Tom ?
This problem is not so difficult that you can &apos;t solve it .
Where &apos;s my room ?
There are still people who are illiterate .
I think Tom did this .
I saw the match on television .
Why are you doing that , Tom ?
Do you have any idea who would do this ?
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
Tom has been sick for a very long time .
We &apos;re not getting anywhere .
I will buy a car .
Tom looked Mary in the eyes .
Let me show you the way .
They &apos;re playing our song .
Tom gets along well with Mary .
You three seem to want something .
I don &apos;t know what that guy &apos;s name is .
Tom can &apos;t work this evening .
Tom is quite crazy .
Tom gave me a hard time .
Tom doesn &apos;t come here anymore .
Don &apos;t be crazy .
It &apos;s not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help .
Tom is good at doing that .
What do you think of the book ?
What are you really here for anyway ?
How are you feeling now ?
You can rely on me .
That &apos;s not what we do .
You can talk here .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
You ought to know that .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing .
Do you know what Tom is doing now ?
I sure wish I could speak French better .
I &apos;m older than you . You have to listen to me .
Tom said it was too cold .
You know what it is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom bought Mary a dog .
Who was the girl you were talking to ?
He looks like a good boy .
Tom seems like a good person .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
I can &apos;t believe we finally made it .
It won &apos;t make any difference .
Do you want money ?
Why don &apos;t we get going ?
It &apos;s raining , but she &apos;s not wearing a coat .
How does Tom come to school ?
Why don &apos;t you go to your room , Tom ?
Do you know where you &apos;re going ?
I wonder what Tom needs to do .
My watch loses three minutes a week .
Tom put his shoes on .
I &apos;m feeling pretty good .
He will be a good teacher .
Who would be stupid enough to do that ?
Tom is about three years older than Mary .
Tom used to play guitar .
It &apos;s white .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
I have no idea who she is .
How many times have I told you ?
Do you have any money ?
I know that he knows .
You &apos;re late again .
How long has it been since we last met ?
You look just like your older brother .
If what Tom told me is true , then we have nothing to worry about .
Why can &apos;t I sing like they can ?
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else to eat ?
Give me that money .
This book is easy to read .
Tom will let Mary decide .
We &apos;ve spoken to each other before .
Could you please tell Tom to be quiet ?
I asked where Tom was .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
I want to know your name .
We have no money .
That makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
What did the doctor tell you ?
Have you heard from him ?
I just wanted to make you proud .
Can &apos;t we talk about this later ?
They often make fun of the boss .
I have one .
A boy came running toward me .
Tom is better at doing that than me .
I don &apos;t know what you want and I don &apos;t care .
I &apos;ll ask Tom to help me .
Have you ever driven a car to Boston ?
Tom says you can fix anything .
Would you like me to show you how to do that ?
I want to tell you about Tom .
Tom can &apos;t play the guitar .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
Judging from what you say , he may succeed .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
What would you do if you were in my place ?
They &apos;re doing fine .
Tom never wrote to me .
I need to buy food , but I don &apos;t have enough money .
She is out now .
Is it a good play ?
I &apos;d like you to go with me .
He is not there .
Do you know where it is ?
Tom sat watching TV .
We should study .
We &apos;re perfectly safe here .
I told you it was too soon .
Can his story be true ?
How many people did you invite ?
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
He &apos;s too old .
She seems to be happy .
Tom called a cab for me .
We lost a lot of time .
I don &apos;t know .
We don &apos;t have a choice . We have to do this .
There was no way of reaching Tom .
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
I heard that Tom and Mary will get married in October .
Here are your keys .
I assume you &apos;re angry .
It could have been me .
We need to do a better job .
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
The taxi has arrived .
You can read this book .
Tom ate the apple .
Why do people do this ?
She testified that she saw the man .
You never should &apos;ve let Tom go to Boston with Mary .
What &apos;s Tom doing here ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem very sure of himself .
Have you watched it ?
Come alone .
When will we meet ?
I have done everything I could do .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
I don &apos;t like it .
What do you think I should &apos;ve done ?
I am not acquainted with him .
The girl I went to the movies with is a friend of mine .
What happened on the bus ?
Tom looked like he was finished .
He made for home .
You were absent from school yesterday .
Tom knew that Mary was John and Alice &apos;s daughter .
I &apos;ll carry you .
Tom said Mary was happy .
I want to know who you are .
Tom seems to have left the country .
Why are you doing this for us ?
I don &apos;t feel well .
I &apos;ll stand by you no matter what happens .
I can &apos;t find anybody to ask .
Tom is a very good teacher .
There was nothing that we could do for them .
I often visited his house .
Tom has three children .
Do you have many friends ?
He wanted to meet me .
He dislikes me .
It will not last more than three minutes .
Tom isn &apos;t in prison anymore .
She didn &apos;t read the book .
Tom knew what to say .
Will you be doing that tomorrow ?
Tom has requested our help .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
I want to tell you one thing more .
You were in love with Tom , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom heard Mary talking .
That &apos;s what I do .
I don &apos;t know how Tom knows .
I go right home after work .
You &apos;re going to be proud of me .
Tom said he &apos;s always been interested in music .
Come on , Tom .
It &apos;s no use worrying about it . There &apos;s nothing you can do .
I &apos;ll go to Boston with Tom .
Are you sure you &apos;re not hurt ?
Here is your book .
Children learn languages very quickly .
Tom can &apos;t forget Mary .
Have you finished yet ?
Tom saw you .
How long will you have to wait ?
He goes to school by bicycle .
She seems to have been happy .
Tom was here .
She had a little money .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
He was in America at that time .
Can you come ?
Did you notice any errors ?
She comes to visit us every now and then .
How are you and Tom getting along ?
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
Tom looks jittery .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
He began to sing .
You scared Tom .
I &apos;m home .
I bought a lot of things .
Tom lives with his family .
You did it again .
Tom is a very good man .
I have no idea who that is either .
I think Tom knows why .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
Have you already read this book ?
Tom was always there for me .
I want to know your opinion .
I &apos;ll see to it immediately .
Money can &apos;t buy life .
We &apos;ll be happy to help .
I didn &apos;t see who was driving .
What do you think it is ?
That &apos;s not good for your health .
Can I catch a taxi here ?
I know you know this .
&quot; Who is it ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s your mother . &quot;
What would you change ?
I &apos;m not coming home .
I &apos;m not able to fix the computer .
I &apos;d rather not speak French .
Tom found that .
It was just a matter of time .
Are they dead ?
What do you want from us ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary .
What &apos;s up , Tom ?
I &apos;m the only person Tom knows in this town .
Why did you decide to study English ?
Tom was just trying to be friendly .
Tom has never driven a car before .
They saw us yesterday .
I &apos;ve nothing to give .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything to eat ?
Do you have any more of these ?
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom has a lot of time .
Tom will go to Boston next month .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
Let me show you the way .
Could we please go home now ?
Who looks after the children ?
They won &apos;t tell us anything .
You must not talk to him .
Tom was right after all .
Give that to me , please .
We &apos;re interested .
Some of you already know me .
Tom &apos;s happy .
Tom stays with us .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be rich .
Tom appears to be looking for someone .
Take this .
I don &apos;t know if I can do this without you .
Tom is not coming .
He always looked happy , but never was .
I want to know what &apos;s going on .
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
This coat does not fit me any more .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t forget Tom .
It wouldn &apos;t have mattered .
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
Tom is easy to get along with .
Why weren &apos;t you here yesterday ?
Time will tell .
You may take the book .
What &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Tom knew .
We &apos;ll be home all day tomorrow .
I learned it from him .
What would I do without you ?
You can &apos;t say I didn &apos;t try .
She helped an old man cross the road .
I think Tom could do that .
Can you sing this song ?
We &apos;ll go home .
I didn &apos;t think it would be that easy .
You are big .
There &apos;s one other thing we need to buy .
I &apos;m very tired from work .
My name &apos;s not Tom . It &apos;s John .
Tom is here already .
That &apos;s how Tom did it .
What &apos;s on TV ?
I don &apos;t have a brother .
He would give you the shirt off his back .
Tom called Mary from the hotel phone .
Everyone was satisfied .
Do you think I &apos;m to blame ?
I went to see a movie with Tom after work .
Tom went to the hospital because he was sick .
Tom became afraid .
Tom was in his office all morning .
Tom knew that what he did was wrong .
We &apos;re not expecting your help .
Tom would &apos;ve been thirty years old today if he hadn &apos;t passed away last year .
I am listening to a song .
Tom could easily have done that .
He &apos;s in the hospital .
This doesn &apos;t happen very often .
He may change his mind later .
I &apos;m coming home , Tom .
Is this the train for London ?
You really should &apos;ve gone by yourself .
When did you get this ?
I still have about three minutes .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a horse .
Do you enjoy losing ?
I am taking a couple of days off .
We should probably go home .
The sun is shining in the sky .
Can you do this ?
My brother is now in Australia .
Please keep quiet .
You should leave at once .
They all went to the restaurant .
Where are you hurt ?
You have to come home .
He is at the office .
I hope you &apos;re not mad at me .
I could hardly understand him .
Tom can &apos;t hear a word you &apos;re saying .
I don &apos;t need any help with my homework .
Tom is probably in Australia .
Turn it on .
Tom is at the airport .
We don &apos;t need to do that now .
I knew that already .
I want some of those .
Tom hasn &apos;t written to me in a long time .
I eat bread .
Why do you think that ?
I married off my daughter .
I really thought Tom was happy .
Do you know that ?
They &apos;re students .
I can &apos;t give Tom everything he wants .
Tom waited , but nobody came .
That doesn &apos;t happen .
I think I &apos;m ready .
This is my bag .
This isn &apos;t just for me .
I thought you might ask that .
We &apos;ve won !
I think I &apos;m beginning to understand .
I don &apos;t think he is right .
It &apos;s not going to be that easy .
Tom stayed up all night .
Tom likes it in Boston .
I &apos;m not doing this with you again .
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him .
He did nothing but watch TV all day .
Tom wrote down everything Mary said .
I can &apos;t believe Tom bought that house .
Tom is going .
We had no choice .
She gave him the money .
I &apos;m not going to do this .
I don &apos;t want to see that .
Tom might be able to do that .
Did you learn that from Tom ?
What exactly did you do ?
That child has a very large head .
Tom knows a girl who can speak French quite well .
Children can &apos;t drink wine .
I wonder what Tom is reading now .
I wish I were young again .
What exactly do you want to know ?
He does not live there any more .
His hair has turned white .
She came into the room .
Are you still busy ?
We &apos;d like to help .
Let me help .
Tom got a present from Mary .
I don &apos;t understand this country .
Tom ought to stop doing that .
You gave Tom the money he asked for , didn &apos;t you ?
He often helps others .
Such a thing can &apos;t happen in Japan .
That &apos;s enough for today .
Who saw you ?
I &apos;m glad to see you .
It ain &apos;t over till it &apos;s over .
You know that I &apos;m right .
Tom took it .
It &apos;s said that he knows the secret .
Do you know how to speak French ?
I was told to wait for a while .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t invited to John &apos;s party .
What do you want to buy ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait that long .
I can &apos;t make head nor tail of it .
Be careful , Tom .
Mary looks hot .
I wasn &apos;t sure if I was going to make it .
I don &apos;t like his type .
I know you want to go home .
Tom knows what Mary wants to do .
Tom is still sleeping .
It turned out that their office had a lot of women .
They &apos;ll do it .
If it rains , I won &apos;t go .
It &apos;s not cold .
Tom has decided to give Mary another chance .
You need us .
How many books do you have ?
Have you been married for a long time ?
I like your thinking .
I remember writing to her .
If I remember correctly , that &apos;s what you said .
We &apos;ve seen her .
Tom didn &apos;t expect to lose .
Why didn &apos;t you just ask someone for directions ?
We &apos;d better go home now .
Tom says he &apos;s willing to do just about anything for me .
It &apos;s here .
I was busy .
Nobody had an answer .
Let &apos;s discuss the problem .
These are our books .
Let me go with you .
Why do you want that anyway ?
That question is easy to answer .
Did anybody else see it ?
Have you ever heard her play the piano ?
Tom said Mary would come .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is happy .
Tom has to go to work .
I &apos;m sorry .
Tom tried to make Mary happy , but he couldn &apos;t .
I want to cook for you .
Tom asked Mary to sit down .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Who gave you that ?
Tom thought the car Mary was driving wasn &apos;t safe .
Has anyone found Tom yet ?
Was I seen leaving ?
It has nothing to do with you .
French is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
We have a few questions for you .
She asked me a question .
Tom couldn &apos;t find anyone to dance with .
You don &apos;t work here .
I wish I had time for a girlfriend .
Tom is in Mary &apos;s office .
Have you really talked to Tom ?
Have you told Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing it that way ?
I already called him .
How was your weekend ?
What are you writing ?
I &apos;m not sure yet .
I can &apos;t believe Tom is gone .
I don &apos;t have to go .
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
Is that what he wants ?
This dictionary doesn &apos;t belong to me .
I don &apos;t want to play tennis this afternoon .
Coffee keeps me awake .
If you were in my place , what would you do ?
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
You must take care of Tom .
They may leave tomorrow .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
Be quiet and listen .
I believe that it can be done .
I knew we &apos;d win .
Nobody speaks to me .
I &apos;ll call you sometime .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t like children .
Is it hard to learn French ?
He went to school only for a few years .
Tom is waiting for my report .
I wonder whether Tom is nervous .
Let &apos;s go to my place .
They &apos;re more than friends .
They &apos;re in the car .
This car is Tom &apos;s .
How far along are you ?
How do you want me to do that ?
I didn &apos;t realize it was so late .
It &apos;s not going to be easy to finish this job on time .
Tom said he would do it again .
She should help her mother .
She is only a child .
What do you want ?
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
They &apos;re as tired as we are .
I didn &apos;t know anything about his plan .
Tom thinks what I did was wrong .
Why do you always talk about Tom ?
He is my uncle .
They &apos;re different .
You can &apos;t help me .
I met a friend of Mary &apos;s .
We need that report by tomorrow .
They aren &apos;t like us .
Is Mary Tom &apos;s mother ?
She was very surprised when she heard the news .
I tried everything .
He must be crazy to say such a thing .
I heard that you &apos;re not going home either .
How did you two meet ?
That is my school .
Do you want the job ?
Tom looked at the clock .
Does money bring happiness ?
Tom can &apos;t do it .
Is it for here ?
It was obvious it would be this way .
Tom felt tired .
I know Tom better than he knows himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand you .
Were you expecting someone ?
What do you have in your hand ?
I wonder whose car this is .
I really thought Tom was happy .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary .
Hey , you can &apos;t leave now .
Tom pretended not to know the answer .
I have no idea who you &apos;re talking about .
Tom never knew his parents .
Is it really you ?
I need to ask you some more questions .
Tom may be hot .
He &apos;s just arrived .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Tom had to leave the movie theater before the movie was over .
Can you see them ?
Tom was thirty .
I &apos;ll stop by later .
Tom and Mary rarely go out .
She wanted a piece of cake , but there was none left .
Tom has to speak French at work .
Tom was asleep when I left .
I still have friends in Boston .
Thank you for inviting me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to do .
It &apos;s very big .
Did Tom enjoy it ?
The boy playing the guitar is Tom .
Tom likes to play tennis , too .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice are all from Boston .
I didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom loves his work .
Why did he come here ?
I don &apos;t eat meat .
Why didn &apos;t Tom say anything ?
They &apos;re both expecting babies .
Did you really expect him to tell you the truth ?
I met my teacher on the way to the railway station .
What were you doing when I called this morning ?
It wouldn &apos;t take long for us to do that .
Tom told me that I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary is .
Tom should &apos;ve waited for us .
Tom killed Mary .
Tom looked good .
I was outdoors .
The child will be six .
He does nothing but read books all day long .
You can go or stay , as you wish .
I should &apos;ve done that yesterday .
Tom passed away yesterday afternoon .
Can you see anything out there ?
I must go now .
Tom knew that Mary was tired .
Tom and Mary took a stroll together .
I want to live at home with my family .
Were you expecting someone ?
That is your book .
I like her . She &apos;s so beautiful !
What more is there ?
What &apos;ll Tom show Mary ?
Tom turned the light back on .
I hear you .
At what hour was she born ?
What does that have to do with it ?
These are Tom &apos;s cats .
Tom isn &apos;t hungry .
I &apos;d like a beer .
I came yesterday .
I didn &apos;t know that she was ill .
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room .
Who listens to Tom ?
Tom works too much .
It isn &apos;t going to be easy .
What time does the ship leave ?
We only use French at home .
Tom seems to be very sick .
I asked Tom to open the door .
Tom has finally finished doing his homework .
There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
You had better go to bed now .
Tom died young .
I like wine .
It will rain tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know Tom as well as I know you .
Would you mind not doing that ?
What kind of help do you need ?
You can &apos;t leave this room .
Is Tom awake yet ?
Tom went for a doctor .
I wasn &apos;t the only one who was there .
I haven &apos;t got it yet .
Did you go to school yesterday ?
Did you tell Tom when to come ?
Why don &apos;t you want to go ?
That &apos;s a good idea .
I &apos;m okay .
It &apos;s well worth the trouble .
Tom seems to like Boston .
Tom will be disappointed if you don &apos;t go to his party .
Tom was home alone at the time .
Tom is arriving soon . You should get ready .
I do like you .
Tom speaks French as well as you do .
Where &apos;s your school ?
Tom invited me to a party at his house .
I don &apos;t want to do this .
Has Tom really come back ?
I &apos;m not busy .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
Why do you want that anyway ?
I had more questions , but Tom seemed to be tired of my questions , so I didn &apos;t ask them .
Why are you doing it ?
It &apos;s not as bad as it seems .
It &apos;s going really well .
He told me to meet him at his apartment .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
The story is good except that it is a little too long .
I &apos;m going to take good care of you .
It is stupid of you to make such a mistake .
I gave that to Tom .
Come back here .
Tom likes to do things by himself .
I couldn &apos;t answer all the questions .
Tom likes taking walks .
I don &apos;t like cats very much .
Tom was supposed to meet me here .
You need to go .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
I hate when that happens .
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
Who is the boss here ?
Have you made a decision yet ?
Let &apos;s try to find a way to help Tom .
You may go at once .
I &apos;m not going back .
We &apos;re out of time .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know what Mary is supposed to do .
Tom won &apos;t believe I did that .
I don &apos;t think that he will come .
He lost everything .
Tom isn &apos;t a good father .
Are you ready to talk about it ?
May I go out for a walk ?
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
Speaking French is easy for me .
Take anything you like .
Why don &apos;t I take this one ?
Do you really want to help ?
I &apos;m good at problem solving .
I don &apos;t know why I said that .
Are you a doctor ?
They may go .
She sat next to him .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t find a job .
Life &apos;s short .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell Mary how old he was .
My father bought this house for us when we got married .
You &apos;re not rich .
He comes here every three days .
Tom always gets up early .
I think you have made a mistake .
I &apos;m not going to work with you today .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
It &apos;s not too hot .
I could never be like you .
It &apos;s impossible for me to explain it to you .
Can you make us some breakfast ?
Tom arrived at the party after Mary did .
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Tom went home .
I almost won .
Tom will do that tomorrow , too .
Tom isn &apos;t looking too good .
I &apos;m not a good person .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
They &apos;re in love .
Why don &apos;t you believe Tom when he says he &apos;s busy ?
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was there .
I &apos;ve had enough of Tom and Mary .
I &apos;m planning to stay at the hotel .
He gets up at 7 .
You can use my car if you like .
Why do you think Tom would do that ?
He &apos;s unable to do that .
What goes on in this room ?
I met your parents yesterday .
Can you open it ?
That &apos;s the question we have to solve .
What did I just do ?
Tom heard Mary play the piano .
All Tom does is sleep .
You don &apos;t know a thing about me .
What was it like living in Australia ?
Would you like to sit ?
It serves you right .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
We have a long way to go .
The last piece of cake was eaten by Tom .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s office .
I &apos;ll telephone you every night .
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to help .
Tom is three years older than Mary is .
You didn &apos;t tell me everything .
What are they up to ?
I hope no one saw you .
Tom is going to love being here .
Vote for Tom .
Tom sat waiting .
I know why we &apos;re doing this .
There is a little money in the bag .
The bus stopped , but no one got out .
It is time you told her the truth .
I can &apos;t leave Tom .
Live and let live .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
I am at home .
What are you planning to do ?
Tom spoke very well .
I know when Tom &apos;s birthday is .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll show you around .
The box is heavy .
Tom says he wants to study French .
I &apos;m too tired to do anything .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
Anyone can make mistakes .
What are you doing out so late ?
I &apos;ll give it to you .
She has three children .
He and I are teachers .
Tom &apos;s story had a happy ending .
They don &apos;t like my friends .
Tom said Mary is very drunk .
I met Tom yesterday .
I want to be sure Tom is happy .
Say it in English .
He doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
I &apos;m going to give you one more chance .
She is not afraid to die .
This is your only chance .
I &apos;ve paid you already .
I &apos;m listening to music .
I think you &apos;d like it .
I can speak French better than Tom can .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t do that .
Tom and Mary are the best friends I &apos;ve ever had .
How old is your dog ?
How &apos;s my wife doing ?
Why don &apos;t we go dancing ?
Tom is responsible for this accident .
That was enough .
I didn &apos;t understand the question .
There &apos;s been no one here .
He wrote one letter .
Tom couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
What do you say ?
I want to tell you something .
I just went home without saying anything .
We want to help you .
Don &apos;t you know what it is ?
Where did it happen ?
I know what you said .
It &apos;s not yours .
Tom ought to stop smoking .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
They &apos;re gone .
I just want to find out what happened .
Is Tom Mary &apos;s son ?
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re right .
Tom has never stolen money his whole life .
You don &apos;t want to know .
Tom fell off his horse .
I don &apos;t want to lose Mary .
I &apos;ve always wanted a child .
That &apos;s none of your business .
My wife &apos;s trying to sleep .
He was sick , but he went to school .
I told Tom to help Mary .
Tom is already sleeping .
She &apos;s my sister .
I &apos;d like to see it .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind walking in the rain .
I told her what to do .
What do you really want to do ?
There is a lot of work to do .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know .
What are you doing today ?
I &apos;ve lived in Boston a little over three years .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
You can &apos;t leave this room .
We &apos;re not always right .
It &apos;ll be our secret .
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you .
There is no school today .
Do you want to see the house ?
Who did you go to the beach with ?
Can you see the picture ?
You &apos;ve done so much already .
We couldn &apos;t understand what the baby was trying to say .
My car is not running .
It grew larger and larger .
Tom asked Mary if she had a dog .
Tom wrote that book .
What &apos;s wrong with these people ?
Aren &apos;t you from Boston ?
I will give her the book tomorrow .
I can &apos;t help loving Tom .
Where is the pain ?
Tom is prepared to help us .
My mother always gets up early in the morning .
Are you injured ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about it further .
How did you meet your husband ?
No one &apos;s going to see me .
They forgot my birthday .
I wonder what time it is .
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Now isn &apos;t a very good time .
Things are going well now .
Do you want me to go with Tom ?
Do you know where it is ?
I want to know your opinion .
Tom knew how to do that .
It &apos;s about time I was going home .
When did you get to London ?
What &apos;s going on in here ?
I was born in October .
Tom wasn &apos;t right .
Tom is not home right now .
I was very careful on the phone .
Why are you still here ?
He &apos;s writing a book now .
Have you finished yet ?
Tom spoke calmly .
I love you , too .
What did you eat for lunch today ?
Tom looked at Mary and so did John .
It &apos;s hard to speak French well .
Who &apos;s going ?
How am I supposed to eat ?
Where did you buy that ?
It is not worth the trouble .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
How would you like your coffee ?
He &apos;ll be in London about this time tomorrow .
Did you see Tom today ?
Tom thinks that he &apos;s better than other people .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I &apos;m starving .
I think Tom stole my bicycle .
He bought a car .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
Tom eats too fast .
I don &apos;t mean you .
Tom didn &apos;t know how old Mary was .
Tom is very good at it .
We worry about your future .
I want to see it .
I can &apos;t find the restaurant .
Have you eaten lunch yet ?
Tom should &apos;ve called .
It was not always this way .
Did you go and see Tom ?
&quot; What would you like to buy ? &quot; &quot; I would like to buy a dog . &quot;
She is a most beautiful lady .
You &apos;re making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
Stop that !
Tom isn &apos;t there , is he ?
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning .
Tom always tries to help others .
Tom did a lot of things right .
Where would you like to go next Monday ?
You should have learned how to swim when you were young .
I have to get Tom home .
I ran outside .
Grab my hand .
I &apos;d ask Tom to do that .
Listen carefully to me .
You must not come into the kitchen .
Tom is rich .
Tom died a few days ago .
I hear music .
It expires tomorrow .
I &apos;ll need some help .
It &apos;s a bit further way .
I do not love him any longer .
Tom said that he loves me and wants to marry me .
I hope we win .
That &apos;s what my mom keeps telling me .
He is her friend .
He can &apos;t buy a car .
I don &apos;t think about that .
He tried solving the problem .
I assume you only hire people who speak more than one language .
They don &apos;t want us to know .
You &apos;re safe now .
Where &apos;s my desk ?
I have the dictionary .
I &apos;m on my way to visit a friend in the hospital .
Everyone knew what to do .
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
She was born in America .
I wonder why Tom is alone .
You &apos;re a problem .
I can explain it all .
This story doesn &apos;t have a happy ending .
Maybe you ought to let Tom do what he wants to do .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll show you around .
Did Tom fall ?
When is your birthday ?
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
I &apos;m taking this one .
I realize it &apos;s probably too late .
When do I get to go home ?
What &apos;s going on ?
Why can &apos;t I go ?
Tom is busy .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me earlier ?
When did you begin studying French ?
What if Tom doesn &apos;t do that ?
You haven &apos;t even tried .
Let &apos;s not discuss this now .
Are you still interested ?
It doesn &apos;t matter when you come .
I don &apos;t see that there &apos;s a choice .
Tom came along much later .
We should do this every day .
It gets better .
I &apos;ll get in touch with you next week .
It &apos;s what I like .
When can I call you ?
There is the train at 10 o &apos;clock .
I wanted to show it to you .
My family lives here .
Is this your first trip abroad ?
Tom is now studying in the library .
I hope that Tom will come .
What &apos;s Tom writing ?
When did you go there ?
Tom can &apos;t find a job .
Dad is a hard worker .
Can we just go home ?
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom yet .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
I &apos;m never too busy for you .
Could you bring me something to eat ?
Just go back home .
What &apos;s the best way for me to get a passport ?
Are you still up ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary , but he &apos;d like to meet her .
Tom wants to talk to you again .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
Where are all the others ?
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
I feel very good .
Could you come to my office when you have a moment ?
There is nothing here .
Tom speaks French about as well as Mary does .
I know that Tom is out .
What &apos;s the name of your dog ?
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
What did you do with Tom ?
Tom has done that for three years .
The kid got hurt .
My father drives very well .
I just don &apos;t know why .
I &apos;m not feeling so good .
They say she &apos;s good at cooking .
We played tennis yesterday .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
I didn &apos;t see it coming .
Tom knows what you did .
Tom arrives today .
Tom went to the city by bus .
After lunch , I returned to the office .
Don &apos;t you know ?
Tom was definitely busy .
Tom stayed at home all day .
Have you told me everything ?
Tom is one of the three guys who couldn &apos;t do that .
You can &apos;t win all the time .
Where &apos;s Tom sleeping ?
Give me your money !
It is only too true .
I would like to marry somebody like her .
Did you find anything else ?
That book is old .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do .
Go to work , Tom .
What would you like to do tomorrow ?
I &apos;d just like to talk .
Is Tom out there ?
You &apos;ll like this .
I have a wife and kids .
I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
Thanks for doing this .
I thought doing this would be easy .
Thanks for all your help .
You &apos;ve already done that .
We &apos;re ready , I think .
Where is the closest train station ?
I know a little French .
He likes animals more than people .
How often does it rain here ?
I know that Tom likes Mary .
We want it .
I can &apos;t remember why I was there .
We don &apos;t have much snow here even in the winter .
The sky has become clear .
I know what we can do .
I find that pretty interesting .
How long have you been in this country ?
It &apos;s hard to love somebody when you don &apos;t know whether they love you as much as you love them .
Tom should apologize .
The movie wasn &apos;t as funny as the book .
I don &apos;t know how to do that .
You shall not marry my daughter !
I don &apos;t like driving in Boston .
Do you want to dance ?
Tom could be dead .
Tom came to Japan as a child .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late .
We &apos;re still in Boston .
Give me another beer .
I can &apos;t speak English as well as he can .
He is about thirty .
I find it hard to believe .
It &apos;s your problem , not mine .
You &apos;ve found it .
What do you expect me to do ?
No one will believe them .
Tom made mistakes .
We need to fix this problem now .
You have to live here .
Where &apos;re the shoes ?
It &apos;s a lot of fun to listen to music .
I &apos;ll give Tom another chance .
He has to stay in bed .
He has to fix the clock .
You &apos;ve found a good man .
It &apos;s that time again already .
Tom seems to enjoy speaking French .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
I hate that .
Nobody wants to do that .
I go straight home after work .
Are you sure you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were , but that &apos;s not going to happen .
She almost always arrives late .
Are you with us ?
We have to do that before Monday .
I &apos;ll take Tom .
It &apos;s a big world .
Most people don &apos;t know this .
What a small world !
I plan to be in Boston until October .
I don &apos;t care for him .
That &apos;s not what Tom said .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s seat .
Tom has one , too .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t .
It &apos;s what Tom believed .
I don &apos;t like this song .
Tom rarely ever walks anywhere .
I waited for Tom for three hours , but he never came .
I intended to go with her , but I was too busy .
It &apos;s that important .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
Tom won &apos;t be expecting us .
I &apos;ve already read today &apos;s paper .
I wanted to talk about it .
Tom &apos;s car is gone .
I guess I &apos;ll find out soon enough .
Sometimes that happens .
I hope so .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
I canceled .
Tom made up his mind to be a doctor .
I think you &apos;re hot .
Tom and Mary look very tired .
I &apos;m game .
Tom is in the building .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
The car hit a tree .
She has a lot of friends here .
Did you find anything else ?
Tom didn &apos;t steal anything from me .
I don &apos;t want to see anybody today .
There &apos;s something I need to show you .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking you to do .
Tom helped Mary fix her bicycle .
Why did Tom give you that ?
Can you come ?
Tom started to sing .
What type of person are you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a cat .
I know you have a girlfriend .
Tom seemed to know the truth .
Tom is old enough to drive .
I &apos;ll tell you my story .
I met him in the crowd .
She is always scared .
I am very dangerous .
I cannot find time to read the book .
Why should I learn French ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I have a sister .
I don &apos;t understand what he wants .
You should &apos;ve let me sing .
I was the only man .
I think Tom wouldn &apos;t mind .
I went to school on foot in those days .
I &apos;m not over it .
I still have some work to do .
I would buy this watch , except it &apos;s too expensive .
You weren &apos;t even there .
We paid Tom thirty dollars to do that .
I know your mother .
Everyone knows everyone else .
Why are you speaking so loudly ?
It began to rain .
The cup is full .
It is not so difficult as you think .
I &apos;ll let you know later .
We didn &apos;t get much done today .
Tom lives near us .
Do you feel like talking about it ?
Why don &apos;t you go home ?
Tom is going to be a teacher .
I want to see your house .
We weren &apos;t able to help Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
I &apos;m a good cook .
Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight .
I saw this coming .
I thought you of all people would understand my decision .
Why didn &apos;t I think of that before ?
I love you more than anyone else .
I must tell you something .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I hope Tom comes soon .
Tom certainly knows where Mary is .
What &apos;re you doing with that ?
How do you think it &apos;ll go ?
They &apos;re tired .
We have enough time .
Tom didn &apos;t know when he &apos;d be back .
If I have time , I &apos;ll do it .
Is somebody out there ?
It &apos;s time for our children to go to bed .
I don &apos;t think I can wait that long .
You have one hour .
We &apos;re ready when you are .
We don &apos;t have to do that .
Tom is three years older than Mary .
What languages are spoken in America ?
Tom wants to talk to all of us .
I &apos;d like to introduce some friends of mine .
Tom will do that .
Tom did that well .
I won &apos;t ask you for help anymore .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
It &apos;ll be fun to visit Boston .
They have nothing against it .
Please tell me what that is .
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
Tom didn &apos;t say anything .
You have work to do .
He found a nice apartment for Mary .
Tom is against smoking .
I don &apos;t like cold weather .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll succeed .
How did Tom like the gift you gave him ?
You ought to ask him for advice .
It made me very happy .
It &apos;s nearly three o &apos;clock .
You don &apos;t scare me .
Tom was unafraid .
May I go ?
That &apos;s not their fault .
Did you speak with Tom ?
Tom came at me with a knife in his hand .
He told me about it .
Are you guys still dating each other ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look too good .
The other one doesn &apos;t work .
It is difficult to talk to him .
Whose is this book ?
We ended up going home early .
What would you say if you were in my place ?
Who is this woman ?
Tom asked Mary to stay where she was .
No one asked your opinion .
I often speak French with my friends .
I &apos;d like to drink some tea or coffee .
You should come .
I &apos;ll be around back .
I hear you &apos;ve got a new girlfriend .
Tom is looking at you .
You can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
Tom can do what he likes .
Tom helped again .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
Why don &apos;t you explain that ?
You need a holiday .
You are expected to pass the exam .
He wants to be different .
Can you play the piano ?
I want you to do what you have to do .
You have such beautiful eyes .
I don &apos;t want to take your money .
I &apos;ve never heard my mother sing .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not half as glad as I am .
I was wondering if you knew where Tom was .
You and I are men .
I want to drink a cup of tea .
I am a teacher .
Cats like playing in the sun .
I don &apos;t understand this .
Tom found it difficult to solve the problem .
Tom must &apos;ve had a good reason for what he did .
I &apos;m so happy .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
A lot has happened while you &apos;ve been gone .
Tom showed up at about 2 : 30 .
We &apos;re good at it .
I need a new car .
She seldom , if ever , goes to movies by herself .
I can &apos;t just not do anything . I have to do something .
I don &apos;t know what to do with this .
It &apos;ll work for sure .
You should read many books when you are young .
Can I talk to you a moment ?
Would you mind telling me what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
Which one do you like best ?
I &apos;d rather take the bus .
Tom really did that well .
It happened .
You can &apos;t still be mad at me .
Tom can &apos;t have gone far .
Did it help ?
Tom likes reading books .
We &apos;re home .
Tom is in his room listening to music .
You &apos;re not going , are you ?
I had to go to America .
You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
Where do you want to eat ?
My mother is a good woman .
I thought I had enough money .
I &apos;d like to be able to tell Tom that he has nothing to worry about .
I wasn &apos;t the one who wrote this letter .
It was not at all funny .
He asked me to do it .
I &apos;ll go on Sunday .
Is Tom from Boston ?
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
You &apos;re doing fine .
Where &apos;s your hat ?
Who gave that to you ?
I forgot Tom knew how to read French .
You didn &apos;t need to take a taxi .
Let &apos;s talk about it after school .
We &apos;re dancing .
That book is a new book .
Look how happy you made Tom .
He loves his daughter , but his wife doesn &apos;t .
I visited him in the hospital .
What was your mother doing when you got home ?
He is always on the go .
We &apos;d like to know about it .
Where are you going to be ?
Can you drive me home ?
Tom hasn &apos;t made up his mind yet .
I was tired , so I didn &apos;t do that .
Tom has worked for me for three years .
All the meat was bad .
I never liked going to school .
You can &apos;t just quit .
Tom has been here for three hours .
That &apos;s a lot !
That would be funny .
I know you aren &apos;t that stupid .
Tom died yesterday .
How is the weather outside ?
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
He opened his mouth as if to speak , but didn &apos;t say anything .
What does Tom think he &apos;s doing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do this .
I can hear Tom &apos;s voice .
The sun is coming up .
Mary thought she could change Tom .
Are you still hungry ?
I often go to the beach .
We have to find it before Tom does .
I don &apos;t care much for coffee .
I heard you last night , Tom .
Why did Tom ask Mary to do that ?
Who gave you that ?
We know each other .
I have never thought about becoming a teacher .
I don &apos;t think Tom is coming .
I wanted Tom to do that .
Tom is the one with a car .
I didn &apos;t think it could happen to me .
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at home .
Tom has a lot of money , but he &apos;s not happy .
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom .
That &apos;s really interesting .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I know what to say .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing Tom .
This is always the way it has been .
I am interested in this book .
English is a language spoken all over the world .
Do you have a question ?
What did they say ?
I &apos;ll tell you right now that Tom won &apos;t know the answer .
Tom and Mary are looking for you .
I &apos;m going to make you happy .
I stayed in Boston last weekend .
Tom didn &apos;t feel like waiting .
Take us with you .
No one tells me what to do .
Is Tom with Mary ?
You swim very quickly .
Why don &apos;t you like Tom ?
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
I think Tom is afraid of you .
We want to speak with Tom .
Tom forgot his wife &apos;s birthday .
Where is Tom working now ?
I think he is a doctor .
Why was Tom chosen ?
Tom won &apos;t be doing that anymore .
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you .
Tom knows what &apos;s wrong .
The two women know each other .
I know none of the three men .
Tom may have been sick .
I &apos;m always busy with my homework .
I thought Tom was meeting us here .
You &apos;ll have to learn to cook .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary , John and Alice .
Have you seen my watch ?
Everyone &apos;s talking about what Tom did .
Where do we have to do that ?
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
I have to go back to work .
We can begin .
I haven &apos;t found Tom yet .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
Let me explain why .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s ready .
Tom could &apos;ve and should &apos;ve helped Mary .
I &apos;d rather not discuss it right now .
Tom had three of them .
I was disappointed that she was not at home .
Might I ask you a question ?
We know where you live .
How long have you been learning French ?
Tom asked Mary a question .
This wasn &apos;t my mistake .
When is good for you ?
She felt a bit tired .
Your hat is somewhere around here .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary does .
Are you finished with the paper ?
It took him two hours to finish his homework .
I wish that I could do more .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t see it .
I hope Tom writes soon .
Did Tom tell you that ?
Tom might &apos;ve died .
I know where they &apos;re going .
We can &apos;t let Tom out of our sight .
Tom died at his home in Boston .
He wrote a letter yesterday .
She died five years ago .
Things are about to change .
Tom came into the building .
Tom gave us a present .
I know a good place for dinner .
Tom is already awake .
I loved that .
I &apos;m beautiful .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what he had intended to say .
I &apos;m going to take this home .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I can &apos;t work for you .
Tom is sorry .
Let &apos;s go back to Australia .
See you tomorrow in the library .
I don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going .
How would I know where Tom is ?
I &apos;m just kidding .
Didn &apos;t you write him a letter ?
He did not say a word to us .
I knew Tom was going to do that .
I think you should think about the future .
Learning languages is interesting .
I don &apos;t think of it like that .
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
Nothing like this has ever happened before .
I might be able to answer that question .
What did Tom really mean ?
What &apos;s the name of this river ?
You know how serious things are , don &apos;t you ?
What are we going to do about it ?
I &apos;ll help as much as I can .
You &apos;d better get going .
The boy I helped is Tom .
Why is Tom in the hospital ?
Let me die .
I think her name is Mary .
Just tell the truth .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
You have three cats .
That &apos;s how I got to know her .
She must be angry with me .
I wonder if you are truly happy .
Tom seems to be busier than Mary .
Those are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
That &apos;s what Tom said this morning .
You still have to pay for it .
I have many friends .
This is your only chance .
You &apos;re welcome to stay as long as you want .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
Tom goes to school , doesn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his birthday .
I want you .
I don &apos;t know anything .
&quot; Let &apos;s dance together . &quot; &quot; I thought you &apos;d never ask . &quot;
Tom isn &apos;t busy today .
Is that the best you can do ?
I don &apos;t want to play .
If you have a problem with that , talk to the boss .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure if he was going to make it .
Tom &apos;s shoes are too small for him .
Tom is like a brother to me .
I hope you aren &apos;t too disappointed .
I should &apos;ve known it was you .
That is your book .
I know it &apos;s not easy .
We &apos;re going dancing today .
Someone gave Tom a car .
You can take a taxi .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
You have to see it .
Our money ran out .
How do you come to school ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know any French .
You got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom thought only of Mary .
Tom has told us everything we need to know .
I know you have it .
Can you answer this question ?
You &apos;re nuts !
All of them are good teachers .
Why didn &apos;t you call me sooner ?
Now &apos;s not a good time .
I usually go to bed at ten .
I had to go there alone .
You are sure to succeed , whatever you do .
It &apos;s possible .
I can &apos;t keep you here any longer .
He took his time .
Tom and I both want you to be happy .
Tom can &apos;t help me anymore .
Who lives here ?
What type of music do you like ?
I do not know when she will come back .
I &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
Are you drunk ?
You should read this .
Tom asked Mary to tell him where she &apos;d been .
I wish I were as young as you .
She has the big room entirely to herself .
No one knows that .
Tom writes badly .
She is expecting a child .
What is his name ?
I eat only when I &apos;m hungry .
I can fix that for you .
There &apos;s your friend .
Have you finished dinner ?
How long do you think we &apos;ll have to wait ?
I don &apos;t know any more than you do .
You saw what Tom did , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom has made a lot of mistakes .
Tom wasn &apos;t home .
Tom wanted to live in Boston .
When is a good time for you ?
How far is it from the airport to the hotel ?
Tom is a hard person to please .
He can scarcely write his name .
Tom ran out of money .
Tom is holding it .
I want a new bike .
Tom took Mary to the train station .
I don &apos;t remember inviting you here .
I haven &apos;t spoken to Tom yet .
What else can I do to help ?
I &apos;ll be whatever you want me to be .
Have you decided to go to Australia ?
She always walks to school .
Tom needs glasses .
Where did you see Tom ?
I thought that you might &apos;ve left town .
Tom sat looking out of the window .
What &apos;s wrong with yours ?
Don &apos;t blame Tom for what Mary did .
Tom said that Mary was very tired .
I &apos;d like some shoes .
Nobody &apos;s happy .
She made him rich .
You would have failed without his help .
Tom will walk .
She did it carefully .
You may ask me any question you want .
He may have said so .
Tom &apos;s parents were both teachers .
What I have to tell you is very important .
I think I can .
Would you like something to drink ?
I don &apos;t feel like waiting any longer .
Don &apos;t let them win .
I &apos;d just like to ask Tom one question .
This really happened .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go .
I thought Tom was ready .
I will do as you say .
I plan to stay in the city .
It &apos;s going fine .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
Tom has a nice camera .
It was Tom &apos;s idea , not mine . Don &apos;t blame me .
The boy has a newspaper .
What &apos;s your mother &apos;s name ?
I &apos;d prefer to speak French .
I don &apos;t want to eat anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he has to do .
You should go .
Why do you think I came ?
He &apos;s got enough money to buy a house .
What are you wearing tonight ?
Tom asked Mary to be quiet .
Someone stole my watch .
What was your name ?
I know Tom helped you .
This is what I like about you .
I go swimming once a week .
Tom bought Mary a nice camera .
Tom died of hunger .
Tom is just a little nervous .
I wasn &apos;t mad at Tom .
Tom does that , too .
I should not have done that . It was wrong .
I don &apos;t know where to start .
I could barely sleep .
What &apos;re we going to do ?
What does Tom think about that ?
Thank you for the present .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
Tom knows everybody .
They &apos;ll remember .
Tom said he would write to us .
I like listening to him .
I know the whole of the story .
I want Tom to understand .
Don &apos;t blame me .
No one takes us seriously .
I make a good living .
How long have you been in town ?
Have you actually ever tried it ?
Tom was surprised by what Mary said .
Tom will probably get charged .
I &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re in danger .
Let &apos;s buy this one .
You can &apos;t afford not to believe me .
What does your son do ?
My cat is white .
Winter is coming .
The car is very fast .
This is nothing .
He had no friend to talk to .
I can only speak for myself .
Is he afraid of death ?
Tom is just a kid .
Tom isn &apos;t at the hotel .
I think he has done it .
I was trying to help .
I knew Tom couldn &apos;t win .
When are you coming back home ?
Tom has a big family .
Tom looks much better now .
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
I &apos;d like to play tennis .
He was not at all satisfied .
Who are you ? What &apos;re you doing here ?
No one is going to harm you .
I &apos;ll give Tom a chance .
He is wearing glasses .
Why weren &apos;t you at school today ?
We had lunch .
I can &apos;t believe I won .
A week has seven days .
You need a plan .
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends .
My mother died when I was a child .
She stood by him whenever he was in trouble .
That &apos;s probably true .
He made me do it .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have any money .
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m going .
He didn &apos;t show up at the party last night .
I like listening to Tom .
You can &apos;t fix it . You should buy a new one .
I had to help Tom do that .
They didn &apos;t do anything .
When do you run ?
Is he your teacher ?
I am very pleased to hear the news .
What do you have ?
The man couldn &apos;t so much as write his own name .
Tom and I are the ones who stole your money .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
He is playing outdoors .
You don &apos;t scare me anymore .
He loves coffee .
The cake is in the kitchen .
You must be crazy .
Tom is the person to ask .
This car is my father &apos;s .
I &apos;m still your boss .
It &apos;s not like I want you here .
You &apos;re not safe here .
He looks happy .
Tom is as tall as you .
That was the moment of truth .
How do you make money ?
Tom saw nothing .
Tom talked about school .
He is reading .
I met Tom in the park .
How do you like it here ?
I can &apos;t change that .
You &apos;re not ready for this .
Would you like anything else ?
Your question is very hard to answer .
I &apos;ll work alone .
She went off with her friends .
I &apos;ll show you how to do it .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
How can I change your mind ?
Tom is very interested in learning French .
What did Tom want ?
Tom and Mary got married young .
I know his name .
I know almost nothing about Boston .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the reason .
Can you swim ?
These things aren &apos;t mine !
I can fix that for you .
I don &apos;t know whether I should believe Tom or not .
I know that Tom can &apos;t understand French .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
I can hardly believe it .
Should I wait for you here ?
He has no friends to fall back on .
I don &apos;t know a thing about her .
You can find somebody else to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want kids .
You can &apos;t be hungry . You &apos;ve just had dinner .
It &apos;s not going to be hard to do this .
Leave us alone , please .
He is married with two children .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
I made him open the door .
What are they ?
What are you going to see ?
I love that movie .
Where are we right now ?
I do not know when she can come .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
They &apos;re very happy .
That was the trouble .
That was the answer I wanted .
You must go to bed now .
I have a few books .
You can learn as much in the library as in school .
I came looking for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want my help .
Are you almost ready ?
Tom won &apos;t win .
Never in my life have I heard or seen such a thing .
I &apos;m all right .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to ask Tom to help ?
Tom is going to do it .
I want to know why you did that .
I hate Boston .
I &apos;m no longer angry at you .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
He had no friend to help him .
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Are you with me ?
I &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t invited .
I can &apos;t believe it either .
That &apos;s not an option .
She was only pretending to be asleep .
How are we going to pay for that ?
I &apos;ll phone you every night .
Tom had a lot to do .
Tom flinched .
When does Tom get here ?
I &apos;ll join you later .
I know the whole story .
You &apos;ve got my keys .
I &apos;ll have a cup of coffee .
It looks like he might win first prize .
We do want that , don &apos;t we ?
Be careful .
I couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
My friends won &apos;t talk to me anymore .
It &apos;s great to see you &apos;re having so much fun .
We &apos;re experienced .
There was no need for you to do that .
We can go anywhere we want .
We have six lessons a day .
How did you get acquainted with her ?
Tom is going to stay in Australia until the end of October .
She was in America last month .
Tom is probably going to be tired when he gets home .
Thank you for your help .
There &apos;s something I have to tell you .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
Tom is the best father I know .
Do you want to sleep on the couch ?
Tom can &apos;t do that very well .
Let &apos;s begin our work at once .
I usually go to school by bus .
I hate my brother .
Tom knew a lot .
This isn &apos;t yours .
Tom stands by me whenever I am in trouble .
What are you and Tom up to ?
Tom can &apos;t sing as well as Mary .
That &apos;s not interesting .
Please continue with your story .
What did he do to you ?
They &apos;re not going to stop .
I could have done it without your help .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week now .
Tom did it for money .
I &apos;m your brother .
How old is Tom ?
Tom was alone in the room .
That helped .
Tom knows all about it already .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary will come .
What were Tom and Mary doing here ?
Did you steal it ?
Tom wants to learn .
Tom needs to answer the question .
Tom frequently does that before lunch .
I knew you &apos;d come .
Tom and Mary are in the car waiting for us .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to go to school today .
I am no longer tired .
I don &apos;t want to see anybody get hurt .
You can study here .
I have a lot of friends living in Boston .
That must be my book .
Tom wanted to say more .
Tom is good at French , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m no busier than usual .
Tom loves Mary . I know he does .
Tom isn &apos;t very different from anybody else .
I surprised Tom .
It &apos;s time to sleep .
Tom knows how to swim .
That &apos;s not so important .
Tom asked for some money .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Did you see the knife ?
I will do everything in my power .
Don &apos;t be so sure .
I need some help with my work .
Have you been stealing from me ?
We just need money to do it .
He seemed to be ill .
I &apos;m very hot .
What do you want to study at college ?
Do you want to go home ?
The bus was two minutes early .
This is the house where my uncle lives .
He talks too fast .
I &apos;ll be very careful .
Could you show me the way to the train station ?
I have to stay home .
How &apos;s the family ?
I thought you said you were going to be working today .
I &apos;ll see what Tom thinks .
He stood behind me .
Why are you still here ?
I wonder what &apos;s inside the box .
There &apos;s a letter for you .
I like walking alone .
Here are the keys .
Come whenever you like .
I still have things left to do .
Don &apos;t come out here .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
Where were you when I needed your help ?
He is too drunk to drive home .
Be careful , Tom !
I &apos;d like to see Tom .
Give them to him .
I found out how to solve the problem .
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
Tom would just like to talk .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see this .
He ought to have arrived home by now .
We had a plan .
Not everyone was satisfied .
You &apos;ll have to go .
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom ?
Tom often goes there .
I am better than you .
Has it arrived ?
I don &apos;t know exactly where .
I can &apos;t remember when I first met Tom .
Tom has been asking to see you .
Please stop talking .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
I wish I had learned this in school .
Tom ought to have told Mary the truth .
I thought Tom loved Mary .
Tom is thirty years old .
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
Where is my dog ?
This question is difficult to answer .
Tom took a taxi both ways .
Let us know whether you can come .
What else do they need ?
He finished reading the book .
Let &apos;s give it to Tom .
Tom , I &apos;m here .
Tom didn &apos;t say where or when to meet him .
My big brother finished his homework very quickly .
I &apos;m not sure why .
Are you guys hungry ?
Tom invited Mary to supper .
We had a really fun time .
My mother is always busy .
If you eat so much , you &apos;ll get sick .
When are you coming home ?
Tom has a brother in Boston .
I met them .
Just don &apos;t say anything .
I want to tell you about Tom .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll think of something .
This used to be my room .
That &apos;s no reason to apologize .
Can someone help me ?
The school looks like a prison .
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary .
What language do they speak in the United States ?
What &apos;re you going to do with that ?
I have nothing else .
Tom likes his new job .
Why didn &apos;t you tell anyone ?
The library has many books .
Don &apos;t give this to anybody .
He didn &apos;t know that .
He has gone mad .
They &apos;re with me .
I don &apos;t have a house in Boston .
Tom is in Boston .
Tom talks too fast .
I &apos;d like to know what happened to Tom .
I did what you told me to do .
My film has run out .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel like talking to Mary .
She thinks that she &apos;s always right .
I &apos;ll be with you right away .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
Do you want to know his name ?
Please shut the door .
It doesn &apos;t matter so much .
I fell .
Is this the train for London ?
&quot; I can &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; Me neither . &quot;
You &apos;re not going .
I don &apos;t want to listen to you .
I wrote this song just for you .
What will you do with your money ?
I received your message yesterday .
I don &apos;t really want to stop .
I have a lot of problems at the moment .
Come back in a week .
No one knew the answer .
Could you carry this box for me , please ?
We talk about it every day .
I &apos;ve still got things to do .
We &apos;ve been here for a while .
I wanted to meet you .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all live in Boston .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
He is not rich , but he is happy .
What did you make ?
Can you read French ?
Do you have a girlfriend ?
I think we can handle the situation .
We &apos;re out of wine .
I want some food .
It &apos;s every man for himself .
I &apos;ll never be as good as Tom .
Are you still angry with Tom ?
I don &apos;t get this .
I don &apos;t like you either .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a cat . However , Tom does have a dog , doesn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
I want very much for you to understand .
My mother is out .
We lost sight of each other .
Tom can &apos;t buy himself a car .
Do you think Tom &apos;s telling the truth ?
Tom would be hurt if you said that .
Come here .
Tom will find you .
Can someone tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
No one was more surprised than me .
Tom speaks French better than me .
It will be over in a moment .
How are we feeling today ?
I know you .
Can I use your dictionary ?
Do you know how long they have been married ?
Tom has told me a lot about you .
We can &apos;t turn back now .
You know how it is .
Did Tom talk to you about that ?
He likes to go to the beach now and then .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
Is Boston very far away ?
He could speak French .
I was angry .
She talked as if she were my mother .
When did you get out of jail ?
I must tell you something .
Life is beautiful .
I &apos;ve already had my supper .
What are you so nervous about ?
I have nothing to do with the matter .
How do I get to the airport ?
I sat down .
What you did made Tom happy .
My wife just had a baby .
Tom &apos;ll remember .
I don &apos;t have a car .
Where are you now ?
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
This one &apos;s from me .
My parents are old .
So what are you implying ?
How are you doing for money ?
That &apos;s how you do it .
This is very interesting .
This makes me very angry .
Tom is eating something .
Start the car .
I haven &apos;t read the report .
Everyone &apos;s watching .
Can Tom walk ?
Do they have money ?
Tom seemed to be expecting something .
My camera is much better than his .
We can &apos;t have you working for us .
You don &apos;t have to be afraid .
I think I should probably go .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
I &apos;m the last one who saw Tom .
He made a speech in English at the meeting .
I &apos;m just being careful .
Tom didn &apos;t seem willing to help .
It &apos;s there .
I need your help .
You certainly have a lot of questions .
When will you call ?
I really should know the answer .
Do you have many friends ?
Tom is still standing .
Why are you going there ?
Is that what you want me to say ?
What do you think she is going to do ?
Tom can &apos;t remember anything .
Tom knew that he couldn &apos;t win .
When did you see the film ?
It is very hot in this room , isn &apos;t it ?
I wonder why you would say something like that to me .
Where &apos;s everybody else ?
I think that it was his mistake .
Something like this can happen to anyone .
Tom has no idea what to do .
They will be safe with me .
Why don &apos;t we try doing this again tomorrow ?
He will come back in a few days .
I see a house .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
Stop listening to Tom .
Tom finished .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all can speak French .
I didn &apos;t want you to miss your bus .
I love money .
When were you born ?
He appealed to our emotions .
They &apos;re just students .
She does not do things like that .
Tom is home again .
Tom felt completely at home .
What does this have to do with school ?
He thought that it would be interesting and fun .
Tom had no money .
Children should be allowed to be children .
You deserve to know the truth .
This is from Tom .
I &apos;m really mad at Tom right now .
Tom is Mary &apos;s friend .
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary .
You think I don &apos;t know who you are , don &apos;t you ?
He works every day except Sunday .
Tom is too good for you .
Tom wondered how tall Mary was .
Tom is doing well .
That should please everyone .
It &apos;s a matter of life and death .
She needs assistance .
It &apos;s their job .
Tom is waiting there for you .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to ask Tom to help ?
You should &apos;ve called me .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
You don &apos;t really mean it , do you ?
It is impossible .
Can I speak with Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t in this picture .
She gets up early .
Where are you ?
He called us at the top of his lungs .
You &apos;ve come too early .
Tom looks sick .
Tom is dying to see you .
That happens every day .
You should know it .
I heard that Tom used to live in Boston .
I want to live in Australia .
How did you get those ?
My wife isn &apos;t beautiful . Yours is .
I know your name .
Stop pretending that everything &apos;s okay . It &apos;s not .
I think Tom will win .
How much did you pay ?
He asked me two questions .
This book belongs to Tom .
Tom was like a father to Mary .
They did not have time to search for it .
He always wants to have the last word .
I think Tom understands that if he wants my help , all he needs to do is ask for it .
Please feel free to ask questions .
Did you help Tom ?
I will come to see you next Sunday .
Tom had nothing to do with that .
It &apos;s under the table .
What do you want to ask me ?
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
I haven &apos;t met him .
I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
You must not open the door .
You don &apos;t have to go , do you ?
What are you going to make ?
I can &apos;t just pretend nothing happened .
Tom knows Mary and John are no longer together .
I &apos;ll give this to Tom .
That &apos;s no good .
I don &apos;t have any money and I don &apos;t have any friends either .
I suppose I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom blames you for the death of his wife .
Which cat is yours ?
What was that ?
No problem .
He can be counted on .
I think I &apos;d be a good father .
Please wait for me at the station .
Do you want milk in your coffee ?
I don &apos;t have to work on Monday .
It was impossible to find an answer .
Why is Tom going ?
Tom wants to buy a new car .
Tom may be on the next train .
I &apos;m quite content with my life .
We &apos;re out of milk .
Tom wanted to stay .
You could have told me .
I am truly sorry .
How many minutes does it actually take to do that ?
You &apos;re sure taking your time .
Tom sat on the bench .
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
Tom got really upset .
Are you Tom &apos;s daughter ?
How many of your students are here ?
He did not come back before ten o &apos;clock .
I want to live in a big city .
Where are you going to study ?
Tom looked drunk .
They know everything .
I &apos;ve had no problems with my boss .
I should read the book .
Tom lives in an apartment .
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
I wonder if I hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
Why are you home ?
I can &apos;t remember anything .
What are they after ?
I &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
I have a pain in my foot .
We &apos;ve been here almost three hours .
You know what needs to be done .
I need the truth .
He speaks English fairly well .
She has been watching television for three hours .
Tom and Mary left together .
I need to know who you are .
Yesterday , they went to the movies .
Tom never wears a hat .
Tom said he &apos;s not doing it .
Tom can &apos;t make it to the meeting .
Tom said you &apos;re old friends .
I &apos;m very sorry I came home so late .
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital .
You talk fast .
I think it won &apos;t be a problem .
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom .
This is the boy I met there yesterday .
Tom and Mary are very old friends .
You have one hour .
When did you begin studying French ?
I can &apos;t swim as well as Tom .
Tom needs a taxi .
I don &apos;t care where you &apos;re eating dinner .
The cat is under the bed .
I like your family .
I won &apos;t see him anymore .
You have to leave Boston .
How do I do it ?
All you can do is to wait .
When I was your age , I had a girlfriend .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
Tom is never late for school .
Give me what you have in your hand .
I want more milk .
How did you and your wife meet ?
I read a book last night .
Let me know if you need my help .
Tom voted for Mary .
Tom remained calm .
It would be fun .
I don &apos;t think Tom is able to do that anymore .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn &apos;t as busy as everybody else .
I gotta do what I &apos;ve gotta do .
I think I &apos;ve been here before .
I don &apos;t know where to go .
We &apos;ll stop here for today .
He is often late for school .
Tom meant that .
This message doesn &apos;t make sense .
We &apos;re alone .
Let me have a look .
You must stick to your promise .
Tom called Mary up yesterday .
I have a gift for you .
Tom has a wife and three children .
Even if everyone else does that , I won &apos;t .
We &apos;re not going there .
I want you home in time for dinner .
I asked Tom where he had gone for lunch .
Tom is doing that for the money .
I want you to come with me to see Tom .
What are your weekend plans ?
The child is going on seven .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that , could he ?
He &apos;s dating my sister .
Tom doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
I want Tom to like you .
Tom seldom speaks to me anymore .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
What are you and Tom doing ?
Tom always does that for me .
Let &apos;s all go to Boston together .
Give it up , Tom .
Whether you like it or not doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary did all her homework by herself .
I only just met Tom .
Tom and Mary are right behind John .
Why are you doing this to me ?
I want to buy something to eat .
Tom will go .
Tom seemed to be sure .
We know you &apos;re there .
Can I say this one last time ?
I &apos;m not very good at singing .
You &apos;ve got to work really hard .
Do you know where she was born ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
Tom said he wanted to go .
It &apos;s ready .
Tom said that he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom is going to have to do that .
Tom is married to Mary .
He doesn &apos;t know how to play the guitar .
You don &apos;t need to go .
I went to bed very late .
You &apos;re not going to like it .
How many people did you see in the park ?
I &apos;d like to dance with you .
He called for help .
Where did you find the keys ?
I think that Tom is tall .
Tom gave me a key .
Dinner is almost ready .
Tom had three of them .
I have everything I want .
I &apos;ll visit my uncle in Boston next month .
I won &apos;t help you .
He was ill , but today he &apos;s all right .
Would you like to say anything ?
This is news to me .
I &apos;ll give that to Tom .
I &apos;d like that .
Let &apos;s hit the sack .
This has got to stop .
I made a bad decision .
That could take weeks .
What you did was wrong .
What Tom did was very dangerous .
We need this .
I &apos;m not proud of this .
I saw him .
They have no more wine .
Let me help you choose .
I &apos;m still not sure what you mean by that .
You will always be welcome .
They will understand .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go .
I &apos;m catching on .
He brought his dog to school .
Tom and Mary want you there , too .
I want to go , too .
Tom has three dogs .
Give Tom what he needs .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
I want to show you something .
Tom gave Mary a piece of his mind .
I &apos;m not done with you yet .
You don &apos;t have to stay to the end .
Will you be home for dinner ?
He is always happy .
Maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
He can &apos;t be under thirty .
She did not say anything .
The boy reading a book is Tom .
Don &apos;t show your face around here again .
There &apos;s nothing left for me here .
No one can help you .
Tom does that quite often .
The old man got off the bus .
It doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
Tom took his daughter to school .
I &apos;m sure Tom won &apos;t help us .
Didn &apos;t you use to work at a hospital ?
You &apos;ve got each other .
I &apos;ll try again .
I am completely against it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do it .
I am in the house .
She had no other choice but to marry the old man .
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s none of my business .
It won &apos;t last more than three minutes .
Do you want Tom there ?
This is what I like about you .
Tom is wearing glasses .
Tom felt strong .
I &apos;m really worried about my child .
I &apos;m glad Tom is gone .
I saw him in the park .
This happened for a reason .
Don &apos;t let Tom near my kids .
He went to the hospital yesterday .
My brother works in a bank .
I can only stay a few minutes .
I think you know I like you .
Many teachers have a problem with Tom .
How is your dad ?
Tom was kind enough to show me the way to the station .
This watch is not mine but yours .
Everything is working .
You don &apos;t really know , do you ?
I need his help .
Tom &apos;s sick .
He lives with his mom .
Tom was a good man .
Tom seems fine .
Tom has written three books .
Watch me .
You should &apos;ve told me the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to do that .
Our teacher seemed surprised .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
Tom put on some clothes .
I hope that I can do it .
I think that you &apos;re right .
You &apos;ve got to see her home .
Tom came to visit Mary .
I think Tom didn &apos;t understand you .
Tom can &apos;t handle it .
You could &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
That would &apos;ve been simple .
I spent the whole day thinking about Tom .
We &apos;ve never been to Boston .
I wouldn &apos;t mind helping Tom .
What did you eat for breakfast ?
Tom might &apos;ve already won .
I don &apos;t ever want to do this again .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom yourself ?
I &apos;ll make you breakfast .
Tom isn &apos;t sick .
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
He was after the first prize .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
Tom arrived very late .
My son is taller than me .
No one knows the future .
I &apos;d like to give you a piece of advice .
That doesn &apos;t matter .
I am very tall .
Why don &apos;t we ask for his advice ?
You can &apos;t help them .
I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s going to rain today .
Tom says that he was born in Boston .
I &apos;m far from happy about this situation .
Where &apos;s the boss ?
I want to know what this is called .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever speak French anymore .
I &apos;ve got some studying to do .
How are you two doing ?
I wish I was with you .
It &apos;s my money .
We &apos;ll take this .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
It was a different time .
Can you take me to the airport , please ?
That big one is also mine .
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before .
What do they do here ?
Tom plays the guitar very well .
I can &apos;t afford it .
I don &apos;t want to lose you .
That &apos;s not Tom .
Do as I say , not as I do .
Did you write this book ?
Tom failed to keep his promise .
I &apos;m glad I watched the game .
You &apos;re pretty good at that .
I don &apos;t think everyone is here yet .
Yesterday was my birthday .
I knew it was too late .
Whatever you do , don &apos;t open that door .
I asked why Tom was late .
The meeting might not be so bad .
When did you work in Boston ?
I will give her the book tomorrow .
We aren &apos;t afraid of death .
Who else was there ?
It &apos;s not from me .
Did Tom talk to you ?
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
I hardly ever see Tom anymore .
It was here that I saw her .
I &apos;m going to be a teacher .
No one cares about me .
We became good friends .
Don &apos;t say too much .
We need that money .
I want to talk to her .
I know that he is not going to pay me .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
Tom asked me to give you this .
I think this is too expensive .
I like your hat .
I will be busy next week .
Sorry , I don &apos;t think I can do it .
Since there was nothing left to do , we left .
We want to talk to you .
Do you have any plans for the weekend ?
He &apos;s fast .
I didn &apos;t actually do that myself .
You &apos;re not young anymore .
I can &apos;t recall who said that .
I read a few books last week .
Tomorrow , I &apos;m going to study at the library .
I don &apos;t know who the man is .
Everything he says is correct .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
I knew who he was .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
That can wait until later .
The baby takes after his mother .
Tom told Mary .
My brother is good at playing tennis .
We &apos;ve got a lot to do .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
Do you know something I don &apos;t know ?
I want you to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have shoes on .
Are you sure we can &apos;t repair this camera ?
I am looking forward to hearing from him .
I &apos;ll do whatever I have to do .
I thought something like this might happen .
Why in the world did you do that ?
Don &apos;t ask me to do that .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
This is the best book that I &apos;ve ever read .
What did Tom tell Mary to do ?
It just didn &apos;t work .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
What does this have to do with Tom ?
The dog likes you .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
I don &apos;t want to work .
That &apos;s not the case .
We can begin tonight .
You look surprised .
What time do you want me to be here ?
Please look after my cats while I &apos;m away .
Why are you avoiding me ?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison .
What is it you &apos;d like me to do ?
We aren &apos;t very hungry yet .
Tom said that I could spend the night at his place .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
I &apos;m not old .
You still have much to learn .
Can you tell me the way to the station ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you could speak French ?
He has this large room to himself .
It turned out all for the best .
Tom didn &apos;t speak .
Tom is eating cake now .
What &apos;s there to say ?
Do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
Doesn &apos;t that just make you angry ?
I hope it was worth it .
Tom can speak French and English .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
Tom , we have a problem .
There is no reason why I should help him .
I &apos;m very happy for Tom .
Do it now , Tom .
We &apos;re at war .
I &apos;m sorry I got you in trouble .
Don &apos;t drink the water .
I need to get back to work .
Close your eyes .
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to be there .
I don &apos;t want to go with you .
A cat is lying in the sun .
Tom needed time .
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
If anyone comes to see me , say that I went out .
I &apos;m not giving this up .
Haven &apos;t you ever visited Boston ?
I want more .
Tom and Mary spend a lot of time together .
He goes to school on foot .
What was Tom up to ?
How old is your little sister ?
You need to learn French .
Take care .
You won &apos;t remember a thing .
This gift is for you .
It makes me nervous .
Having finished the work , Tom went home .
What is it that you want , Tom ?
We can do it right now .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
There &apos;s not much happening here .
I have to buy a car this weekend .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
Tom needs a coat .
Tom wants to go out for a walk .
How young do you think Tom is ?
Do you know where he lives ?
We know him .
I don &apos;t hate you anymore .
Sorry , I can &apos;t help .
Tom told us a long story .
We all have things we don &apos;t want to tell others about .
Tom asked Mary where her mother was .
This is the last train .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t remember seeing Mary at the party .
It &apos;s a book on animals .
Didn &apos;t your parents give you anything ?
It doesn &apos;t matter whether your answer is right or wrong .
Give me back the book after you have read it .
Tom has many friends to help him .
He doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
Tom is taller than his brother .
It wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
I sympathize .
I &apos;m a father .
I didn &apos;t get an invitation .
Is there anything else I need to know ?
Is there any place you want to go ?
Who &apos;s your mom ?
Things don &apos;t just happen .
You &apos;re not worried about the test , are you ?
Speaking French is easy for me .
Where &apos;s everyone else ?
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
We can &apos;t even be sure Tom is in Boston .
We &apos;ve got a problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand that .
They know about it .
He can do it well , and you can do it even better .
Tom said you would come .
We &apos;re not surprised .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s you .
Tom and I are afraid .
It &apos;s going to rain this evening .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can do that or not .
Nobody came to work this morning .
You know I don &apos;t have a car .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
It can &apos;t be Tom .
She takes a walk with her dog every day .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
Tom just wants to be left alone .
I &apos;ve got good news for you , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t give it to me .
Tom is out , but Mary is here .
Tom went to the theater with Mary .
I don &apos;t want to be with you .
It can &apos;t be !
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t understand that .
Where &apos;s your dog ?
I &apos;m the one who should apologize .
This is a dog .
I can &apos;t stay much longer .
I want to see your house .
I think it would be fun .
I found it on the street .
I should &apos;ve gone to Boston with Tom .
I &apos;ve already heard this story .
Now I feel bad .
I &apos;m glad you got home safely .
None of us was able to answer the question .
I don &apos;t remember him saying that .
I don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
We have no choice but to go .
Tom and Mary are no longer together .
You need to answer the question .
My father is at home .
I thought you were off today .
Tom did that for Mary .
I &apos;m as old as you .
This is my room .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
My French has gotten a lot better .
He wouldn &apos;t believe us .
Tom has come to see you .
The sun is rising now .
I saw that movie three years ago .
I &apos;ve asked everybody .
Don &apos;t look at it .
She drives very fast .
She knows how to play the guitar .
Let &apos;s play something .
Tom doesn &apos;t need money to have a good time .
We &apos;re not finished .
These are mine .
The baby is still sleeping .
She put the money in the bank .
Why don &apos;t people like me ?
I said I &apos;d wait for Tom .
I saw the movie .
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn &apos;t answer .
Have you begun studying French ?
I &apos;ll give you one last chance .
I told Tom to help Mary .
I made him carry the suitcase .
That wouldn &apos;t be good .
Do you know where Tom is going ?
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
All I ate yesterday was one apple .
Does anyone still do that ?
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
My eyes hurt .
How do you know all these things ?
I just want to be happy .
I eat a lot .
Tom would never do that .
We had only one chance .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
Tom asked us what we wanted to do .
I wish I could join you .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all the questions .
I &apos;m good .
Is that you , Tom ?
Are your parents home ?
I love going to Boston .
She died yesterday .
This is true .
He arrived earlier than usual .
What time do you want to meet tomorrow ?
This is all that I know .
I thought Tom would give Mary John &apos;s phone number .
I haven &apos;t decided yet whether I will attend the party .
One cup of coffee , please .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
Tom wants to see it .
Tom likes to watch TV .
I don &apos;t want the money .
It is easy to read this book .
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
Tom wants to know who Mary &apos;s boyfriend is .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
Go somewhere else .
Nothing &apos;s going on .
I was wondering if you &apos;d let me stay with you for a few days .
She lost a book .
Tom might never speak to me again .
He has a sister and she goes to school , too .
I like you .
Tom got up and went away .
I understood that .
I didn &apos;t want Tom at my party .
Why did you not go to Boston ?
He told him right to his face .
I &apos;ve said what I had to say .
Aren &apos;t you scared , Tom ?
What do you think about the book ?
Did it work ?
Do your parents know that you &apos;re here ?
Tom had no options left .
I see your cat in the garden .
I &apos;m not going to get it .
Tom thinks that &apos;s not a good idea .
I love talking to you .
He &apos;s very fond of walking .
Tom doesn &apos;t like living in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to Australia last year .
Don &apos;t let anyone else tell you otherwise .
Can we come , too ?
They didn &apos;t pay me .
Tom asked me if he could use my computer .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
I love you and I want to marry you .
I &apos;m about to turn thirty .
I only have a few books .
Tom told me that he was sick .
No one knew who he was .
How &apos;s it going , Tom ?
I hardly see you anymore .
Tom comes home every day for lunch .
Tom may do whatever he likes with what I gave him .
You don &apos;t have to be alone anymore .
I want to be a good father .
It is no use talking to him . He never listens .
Tom can hardly walk .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
This airport is easily accessible by bus .
All we can do is wait .
Tom wanted to speak with Mary .
Tom has no idea where he left his keys .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
What do you have in mind ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you do that .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary .
I can &apos;t imagine what life would be like without you .
Tom knew Mary was hungry .
I can &apos;t afford to live here anymore .
He owns this land .
We can help you .
You can change it if you like .
I don &apos;t remember you .
No one &apos;s stopping you .
My father often falls asleep while watching TV .
I &apos;m tired .
Tom listened to my opinion .
That &apos;s very good news .
I can hardly hear you .
Are you sure you didn &apos;t do anything ?
Let &apos;s try once again .
You &apos;re back .
You &apos;re supposed to be home with your parents .
I don &apos;t like doing that .
Tom seemed to be interested .
He doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
Everybody loves her .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to buy anything for Mary &apos;s birthday .
You &apos;re welcome to come with us if you want to .
Where &apos;s Tom anyway ?
We &apos;re both very tired .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom .
Do you want to tell me what this is ?
It now looks as good as new .
Do you want my opinion ?
I understand everything .
You should go to the doctor .
Do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to dance .
Tom is proud of his daughter .
I have a dog that can run fast .
I &apos;m so happy for you two .
Can you come to the office by train ?
How old is your cat ?
Tom was assertive .
Nobody wants you to do that .
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself .
She introduced me to her sister .
He will play tennis with his friends .
Tom said he was going to Australia .
What do you want to watch ?
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
Tom and Mary are expecting you .
She did not say anything .
I get what you &apos;re saying .
All three of you need to do that .
Tom isn &apos;t leaving .
Tom had all day to get that done .
I don &apos;t have enough money .
It &apos;s not unheard of .
Where did you get the idea ?
I can &apos;t leave Tom there .
I &apos;ve been looking for you .
I have to change .
I have a wife and family .
How are you guys doing ?
I love him , but he loves someone else .
I &apos;ll know tomorrow .
This book is new .
Tom will be in his office all afternoon .
Don &apos;t take things too seriously .
Nobody saw Tom do it .
Here are your keys .
A man came to see him .
Who told you that ?
We &apos;re almost done .
When did they leave ?
I know Tom was right .
My family is not that large .
We aren &apos;t going to stay at that hotel again .
Why don &apos;t you go alone ?
It appears to me that you are right .
We have to wait for him .
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
I chose to wait .
You &apos;re very different from us .
This is very good soil .
What are you going to do there ?
We got a good price for that .
The meeting is ten days away .
Tom could do that .
How can you still be hungry ?
I am disappointed at the news .
His house is by a river .
Tom isn &apos;t that type of guy .
Would you like for me to do that for you ?
French isn &apos;t spoken here .
Tom is trying really hard .
I &apos;m easygoing .
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
Tom went to Boston by bus .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
Is it certain that he will help us ?
The weather is beautiful today .
I &apos;m going to take Tom home .
Tom never told me where he lived .
What is two times two ?
I &apos;m so tired !
You must believe me .
Shut up and listen .
You &apos;re very busy .
There was no answer to my question .
I have to explain this to Tom .
My watch is ten minutes slow .
I hope Tom &apos;s right .
What happened next ?
They know something we don &apos;t .
Do they know ?
I do want to go with you .
Tom knows exactly what to do .
Yesterday was Sunday .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
Tom was like a father to me .
It could &apos;ve happened to anyone .
I can &apos;t explain any of it .
We &apos;re reading .
Tom can &apos;t read yet .
Today &apos;s your birthday .
It seems to be serious .
I wasn &apos;t hired .
May I play the piano ?
Tom has gone for the day .
I &apos;ll take you with me .
I have to get my watch repaired .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
When will he come ?
How many hours did you work this week ?
You need to stop saying that .
Why didn &apos;t you ask me ?
I just don &apos;t get it .
I &apos;m slightly hungry .
Tom will go with us tomorrow .
Did you see her face ?
Maybe it will be exactly the same for him .
We &apos;ll help you out .
I need to get to this meeting now .
I think I found something .
You don &apos;t want to make Tom mad , do you ?
I plan to go to Boston next month .
Are you sure about that ?
Did you see her face ?
My head does hurt a little .
He has something to do with the case .
Were you looking for Tom ?
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
Don &apos;t show off .
He was persuaded to change his mind .
I &apos;m about to take Tom home .
I wish that you hadn &apos;t told me that .
How long have they been here ?
I thought of that .
I wasn &apos;t hungry .
You should have told him .
Don &apos;t talk !
We cannot do the work in a day .
We have to start .
I told Tom not to worry .
What do you want to say to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there .
His speech was too short .
Where is my beer ?
That wouldn &apos;t have happened here .
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
I have no horse .
When did you begin learning English ?
Don &apos;t worry about such a thing .
He wanted to meet you .
She came out of the room .
A lot has happened .
Why can &apos;t Tom just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
How often do I have to tell you ?
He raised his hand .
What happened to the ship ?
You must try harder .
He gets up at seven .
I wish I didn &apos;t have to work .
The food is cold .
I &apos;m proud of myself .
Please do it quickly .
Tom has a lot of books .
I think your answer is correct .
The dog went away .
I can carry that for you .
You managed it after all .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d remember me .
There is a big park near my school .
You know , don &apos;t you ?
You said you &apos;d go to Boston with me .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really here .
Tom made a big mistake .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t coming .
I think Tom might be in Boston right now .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Is it time ?
Tom looked very tired when I saw him yesterday .
We all want Tom to be happy .
I have to get to school .
Would you like to hear about what I did last summer ?
Her idea is better than yours .
I think I can help with that .
Please be quiet , everybody .
I think it &apos;s going to be fun .
Are you short ?
This book &apos;s new .
He told his brother the story .
We have to do this right away .
You &apos;re lucky Tom didn &apos;t come .
If only he would marry me !
I spoke to Tom just a few minutes ago .
Tom walked alone .
We &apos;re from Boston .
Is there anything I should know ?
Something may have happened to him .
I still have a few minutes .
You may go home .
I would like some fish .
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that that has happened .
One can always find time .
Nobody could believe it .
Tom won .
I have to study for the test .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
Tom himself tried it .
Tom , I &apos;m hungry .
Let Tom come .
Tom is mad at us .
We used to work together .
I love my dad .
You don &apos;t like it , do you ?
He doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
She is a bit like her mother .
This word is new to me .
Tom ate my lunch .
I hung up and called her back again .
She was wearing a new hat .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary anything about that .
I &apos;m supposed to talk to Tom .
Tom talked about his feelings .
I know Tom &apos;s secret .
Tom is likely to win .
She pretended that she knew nothing about it .
What are you going to do to me ?
It is the in thing to do .
We want to help .
It &apos;s important , so I &apos;ll do it .
She was there in the morning .
I wish I could speak English .
The airplane is ready .
I know what to do .
He had to work even on Sunday .
Tom won &apos;t go away if you don &apos;t want him to .
This isn &apos;t about you , Tom .
Tom is a friend of ours .
Tom sounds nervous .
Tom needs your love .
He is unable to do it .
Do you want to do that ?
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
The train has not arrived yet .
Do you know where you are ?
Tom wants to move to Boston .
They &apos;re very , very good .
She is far from beautiful .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
They called .
How do you make a box ?
I &apos;ve never spoken with Tom in French .
I don &apos;t hear that often enough .
Does he have a dog ?
I won &apos;t work with him .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom looks dead .
He didn &apos;t see anything .
Tom rewrote his report .
My sister has a piano .
Tom bought a camera from Mary .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
Tom isn &apos;t hurt .
Tom can &apos;t stay long .
Tom helps Mary .
You &apos;re not dead .
Tom wished he had something to do .
My father gets along with his friends .
I don &apos;t know where Tom used to live .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
I &apos;m tall .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
You don &apos;t look like your dad .
Tom kept walking .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that tomorrow .
What &apos;s his name ?
Can you explain your answer ?
Do you think English is difficult ?
I must tell you something .
I like doing stuff like that .
I knew too much .
My children are at school .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to him .
The door is still open .
I think I &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
Did you see Tom in the park ?
You don &apos;t want to go , do you ?
I saw something I wished I hadn &apos;t seen .
Tom asked a lot of questions .
Everyone likes her .
Tom is permitted to do that , but Mary isn &apos;t .
That wasn &apos;t our fault .
I am not accustomed to speaking in public .
Things might get a little rough .
Tom often walks to school .
Tom didn &apos;t come .
Tom does nothing but play all day .
Tom won &apos;t likely sleep very well tonight .
Who found her ?
Both Tom and I work .
Snap out of it !
I &apos;m doing a lot more now than I used to .
Tom was frightened and didn &apos;t want to be left alone .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do this .
I listened .
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
I &apos;ve heard it said that you should never marry your first love .
Tom and Mary are doing that with John .
That &apos;s not the way it happened at all .
I &apos;m not going to make it there on time .
How was the French class ?
Tom isn &apos;t always late .
Why didn &apos;t you guys tell me ?
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
Have you seen Tom &apos;s new apartment ?
She &apos;s better at it than I am .
It &apos;s you who doesn &apos;t understand .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t mind .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
I &apos;ve got it .
What &apos;re you eating ?
I could swim well even when I was a child .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom right now .
How do you plan to help ?
Tom can &apos;t go home until after 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t want to study today .
This is the end of my story .
Tom and Mary became good friends .
You should leave at once .
We can &apos;t tell Tom .
This might be something we can use .
I want to buy a new camera .
Are you certain ?
You &apos;re old enough now .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell Mary the truth ?
Why did you go there ?
I &apos;ll go .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
I think you &apos;re going to make it .
You should not have done that . It was wrong .
I know some of these girls .
You &apos;re still a student , aren &apos;t you ?
It was rather funny .
When did you go there ?
The teacher didn &apos;t let the students ask any questions .
I have to get ready for work .
He is a very good speaker of English .
He took the trouble to show me the way to the station .
Tom seems to be rich now .
Everybody &apos;s talking about it .
Did Tom go to Boston ?
I prefer to do it on my own .
You are seriously ill .
Tom is looking at it .
I have a question for Tom .
They are eating just now .
I don &apos;t intend to have anything more to do with Tom .
I didn &apos;t want anything .
I think Tom moved to Boston .
How would you say it ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I don &apos;t remember that at all .
Is it too big ?
Tom said you &apos;d be able to help me .
I didn &apos;t see what happened .
I want you to tell me everything .
Tom wanted to eat the whole cake .
Tom didn &apos;t think so at all .
Tom was stupid .
I am tall .
Both of us are from Australia .
You may go now .
It can &apos;t be !
All of my children live in Boston .
I wish I could stay longer .
Tom and I are going to be there .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I think that you ought to apologize to her .
Tom needs this .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom is married to .
What are you doing next Monday ?
How many languages do you speak ?
Tom got into his car and drove off .
I don &apos;t hear anything .
Tom never asked .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d be able to do that .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
I left home at seven .
When did you get home ?
Tom is making his bed .
Tom &apos;ll come .
Tom didn &apos;t want to move to Boston .
I saw him enter the house .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I really need to talk to you .
Children like playing outside .
I don &apos;t like cats .
You were in danger .
Tom works there .
I feel like I know you .
Things are not like they used to be .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t need to .
I wish I was young again .
I speak English .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you so soon .
We know everything you know .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t sorry .
I &apos;ve got more .
I &apos;m only going to say it one more time .
His mother and sister were sick .
These are good .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
I don &apos;t yet have a present for Tom .
Are you afraid of getting hurt ?
I think that Tom knows Mary .
Tom couldn &apos;t say anything else .
Can you please say that again ?
I can &apos;t give it to you .
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom ?
Do you think it &apos;ll be that easy ?
I want to hear you say it .
Tom was able to buy what he needed .
There &apos;s no need to get so angry .
Have any of you read that book ?
I &apos;m glad you like my apartment .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
If you wish , you can go .
You can &apos;t bring your cat to school .
You almost missed me .
He asked my mother .
I &apos;ll come , too .
What can you tell me about this ?
He is one of my old friends .
It &apos;ll take you too long .
I &apos;m going to cook for you .
Let &apos;s meet at 2 : 30 .
How much did you win ?
You may stay here as long as you like .
There is no clock in my room .
I know Tom loves me .
Tom likes to be here .
We know you .
Tom and Mary are in the office waiting .
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
I want you to come with me to see Tom .
What time is it over there ?
Tom is playing piano .
Just go away .
My uncle gave him a present .
Is this good French ?
Meat , please .
Do they know about us ?
What do you see ?
Tom often goes there .
Where can I find the milk ?
I think you &apos;re going to like this movie .
Can somebody please help me ?
May I use your car today ?
I &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t do that .
I wrote a letter .
Why were you eating by yourself ?
I think Tom knows Mary .
They may not know anything about this .
You have to call Tom .
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
I should not have said that .
Tom was the last one to say he &apos;d help .
Tom wanted to know why it would take three hours .
I don &apos;t think your name &apos;s Tom .
He doesn &apos;t have a hat on .
&quot; Where is my wife ? &quot; &quot; She is in jail . &quot;
Be quiet while I am speaking .
Tom is still on the job .
If I had enough money , I could buy this book .
He seldom comes to see me .
You &apos;ve got my vote .
I think they &apos;re students .
If you want to succeed in life , work hard .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting here like this .
Which country are you from ?
Tom wants to help .
Tom rarely goes out .
That &apos;s not how the world works .
They &apos;re just doing their job .
That is all that he said .
What about your wife ?
You may take the book .
Do you think Tom did this ?
Tom was interested .
Tom talks fast .
I &apos;ve still got work to do .
Tom knows where we live .
It is impossible to know what will happen in the future .
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s going on .
Can we not talk about this just now ?
Tom is kind to Mary .
Do we have enough time to finish this before Tom gets here ?
Tom usually doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
He is his friend .
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
We have seen no one .
Tom kept still .
Tom called me back .
Why does Tom want us to do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like being told he &apos;s not old enough yet .
He likes me and I like him too .
&quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a key . &quot;
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
My mother was up late last night .
Tom began working .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
Tom told me that he spoke French .
That hat looks good on you .
What does Tom have to do with this ?
Tom asked me to talk with you .
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
I can afford good food now .
Mary doesn &apos;t have a husband .
You can &apos;t just not do your job .
I wasn &apos;t the one who wrote this .
I &apos;ve often been there .
Do you know Tom &apos;s phone number ?
It &apos;s already too late .
That &apos;s up to you .
He left his wife .
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve done .
I &apos;d be crazy to expect such a thing .
Don &apos;t let anyone else tell you otherwise .
He wrote the report .
It still doesn &apos;t work .
You must be tired .
Why would I tell you ?
I think I &apos;ll take this one .
Would you like to play with us ?
How is it going with Tom ?
You have to go whether you like it or not .
Have you finished ?
Tom should &apos;ve called me .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t understand .
Tom said that it probably wouldn &apos;t take too much time .
I think Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
I don &apos;t know if Tom is dead or alive .
I know why you &apos;re here .
Why are people here ?
Tom wanted to see you .
She says she likes flowers .
Tom is a bit slow in the head .
I &apos;ll be back at six .
Could we talk in private ?
I should have studied more .
It &apos;s more than enough .
Do you mind if I ask why ?
He read the book yesterday .
What &apos;re we doing in here ?
I know that Tom hurt you .
Tom &apos;s passport has been stolen .
Did you tell Tom about this ?
I tried to help her .
I can get it from Tom .
This report is badly written and is full of mistakes .
We &apos;ve been looking for you .
I have three dogs .
Tom &apos;s family is in Boston .
This is my final offer .
All are present .
I invited them to the party .
Tom likes apples .
This book is really interesting .
Tom opened his mouth to say something .
Give them to me .
Tom didn &apos;t deserve that .
They tried everything .
Why were you late ?
Father let me drive his car .
I started studying French three years ago .
We have no school today .
We get paid better than a lot of people do .
Why didn &apos;t you buy any coffee ?
Is that seat available ?
I &apos;m surprised .
He doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
We &apos;re a little early .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do it again .
Tom said he didn &apos;t see anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go .
That house is very small .
We never talk .
We &apos;ll definitely ask Tom to do that .
His opinion was unimportant .
They are older than Tom .
Who wrote to Tom ?
Where did you learn all this ?
That news got around .
I want to do this .
How many books are in your library ?
This is the very book that I wanted to read .
Did you already do your homework ?
I can &apos;t remember why I did that .
I &apos;m busy right now .
I thought Tom died last year in Boston .
I just hope Tom stays awake until Mary gets home .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
Tom went back to bed .
Tom likes to show off .
I got home and took my shoes off .
I got a letter from her .
I was only gone an hour .
How come you know French so well ?
Tom was at home alone .
Tom said Mary is a good mom .
Tom fell off his horse .
Tom asked Mary why she was late .
Tom brought this .
I &apos;m not sure what Tom meant by that .
Tom went to school with Mary .
When exactly did you get here ?
Tom is actually eating right now .
I suppose it &apos;s going to rain this evening .
This is not about money .
Tom seems serious .
We need to do this .
The sky has brightened .
Tom ate .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
He &apos;s old enough to be your father .
Why is Tom still awake ?
When &apos;s that going to happen ?
I felt isolated .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I wrote that book .
I feel a lot better today .
Can you come with me now ?
Dad will return in a few days .
Tom is loving .
Tom seems quiet .
He helps us .
I have no time to write to her .
Are these yours , Tom ?
He lives in his car .
Tom called Mary to tell her he &apos;d be late .
I don &apos;t know what time it is .
My father became old .
Tom is likely to win this game .
This will be difficult to do .
Tom knows that Mary can &apos;t speak French .
I forget his name .
What would you have done in Tom &apos;s place ?
She &apos;s made up her mind to quit the company .
He lives in Boston .
I don &apos;t want to tell my girlfriend that .
Where did you meet my father ?
Tom and Mary are my friends .
We want to get out of here .
Tom never should &apos;ve told Mary that he loved her .
You must certainly be very hungry now .
I &apos;m very happy to see you .
She still loves him .
Don &apos;t you know how ?
I had no idea that Tom knew how to speak French .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about what happened .
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend ?
Tom said Mary is at home .
I don &apos;t have much time left .
It &apos;s very kind of you to help me .
I consulted him about the matter .
I will give him the book tomorrow .
Tom is the one with a car .
Do you want to talk about it ?
It &apos;s raining .
I waited for you .
My sister is pretty .
I remember hearing the story once .
I know what Tom is doing here .
She became very ill .
It &apos;s ten minutes to two .
I don &apos;t have the time to do that right now .
I &apos;d like to call my family .
Do you know about this ?
We know you like Tom .
I want to meet Tom .
He may be the very man that I need .
That &apos;s more than enough .
You could help me .
Where are Tom &apos;s things ?
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom looked cold .
Is that a new dress ?
This is your key .
I asked him if he would help me .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
I was in bed all day long yesterday .
Is that all you want ?
Tom accepted our offer .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
Tom is at school , isn &apos;t he ?
Why should I apologize to you ?
Is there anything you want to tell me ?
Return at once .
He bought her a dog .
Can you come back later ?
What is it you need ?
Not everyone who lives here is rich .
I &apos;m surprised that you won the prize .
How good a swimmer is Tom ?
You &apos;re not as young as Tom .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll have enough time .
Tom and I always tell each other everything .
I &apos;ll ask Tom what he thinks .
Your hands are cold .
Don &apos;t go .
You &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
Tom is taller than me .
Tom is not who you think he is .
Tom knows I want to leave as soon as possible .
Who else was at Tom &apos;s party ?
Is that what you said ?
Let me sleep for ten more minutes .
She bought him a dog .
Please give me a cup of milk .
You need a holiday .
Tom and Mary became teachers .
Tom is in the back yard .
I hope you feel better tomorrow .
Don &apos;t worry too much about that .
Tom invited me over to watch a movie .
I still need your help .
I was very hungry .
Tom said that wasn &apos;t the case .
Did you see my father ?
This is the office in which he works .
Did you read the whole book ?
I can &apos;t understand this word .
Tom made a speech .
What am I doing here ?
Would you like bread ?
I almost never speak French .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
Is this your bicycle ?
Tom asked Mary who her father was .
I lost track of the time .
Do you want to go ?
Where do you come from ?
Tom hadn &apos;t eaten anything the whole day and was hungry .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
Why do I have to do that ?
Are you finished here ?
I have a new car .
They &apos;ll be back soon .
I would like a word with you .
Mary made the kids breakfast .
Tom is lucky to be alive .
Have you ever heard someone speaking French ?
Tom loves making things .
He had a book in his hand .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
He seldom gets angry .
I know where she lives .
Tom asked Mary where John was .
I &apos;d like to see you .
I know Tom is your friend .
She &apos;s at the hotel now .
Tom says he hopes Mary will be able to do that tomorrow .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
Maybe we should help Tom .
The fire went out .
Tom helps Mary with her homework sometimes .
Tom has been married a long time .
You should &apos;ve seen the movie .
He was busy when I called him up .
I &apos;ll return at 6 : 30 .
You must do as I tell you .
Are you here ?
She made fun of her husband .
I hope it won &apos;t rain this afternoon .
I think I know why Tom didn &apos;t do that .
We haven &apos;t got much time .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom is doing .
I &apos;m speaking .
Where did you see them ?
Tom and Mary plan to get married soon .
Tom no longer lives with his parents .
Tom knows something that he &apos;s not telling us .
We may as well start at once .
I &apos;ll come tomorrow .
Tom is always getting people to do things for him .
I &apos;ll be back right away .
Tom isn &apos;t going to sing .
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .
Why are you so tired today ?
Tom thinks he knows the answer .
It &apos;s OK with me .
If you don &apos;t go , you &apos;ll have to apologize .
Tom became serious .
I think we need those .
In October , I was in Boston .
I &apos;m not certain .
Perhaps we could do that tomorrow .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
I &apos;m not afraid of Tom anymore .
I &apos;ve got that .
What goes on in here ?
What was he up to ?
Tom tackled the problem immediately .
Where does Tom have to do that ?
Tom says he &apos;s busy .
She came alone .
I need to explain a few things .
Tom hasn &apos;t returned yet .
I invited all my friends .
You are only young once .
What &apos;s happened , has happened . It &apos;s history .
Do you have a key to Tom &apos;s apartment ?
Say Tom , what &apos;s wrong ?
It doesn &apos;t look as if it &apos;s going to happen .
He made a mistake .
I helped .
I &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t do anything .
This is not good .
They aren &apos;t coming today .
Why do you have two cars ?
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
I have some money .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else to eat ?
I &apos;ll give you another chance if you want it .
I hope that this isn &apos;t a mistake .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s wife like ?
What has become of your sister ?
I &apos;ll call you up tomorrow morning .
I am tired .
Tom said he may do that .
We can &apos;t leave Tom alone .
This is a picture .
This is good for me .
He does not have to do this .
Tom will like this place .
I stopped working for Tom three years ago .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
I don &apos;t want to go , and besides it &apos;s too late .
Tom is out .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
Come back in a day .
I can &apos;t get in touch with Tom .
I was away .
Tom isn &apos;t eating .
The boss made them work day and night .
He cannot play guitar .
I would rather die than marry him .
Tom and I are very busy .
Tom got to school just in time .
We have made friends with Tom .
A great deal has happened while you &apos;ve been away .
Tom seemed mad .
I wish I &apos;d met her .
Tom tried to contact Mary .
I think she &apos;ll help me .
I don &apos;t mind if it &apos;s a little cold .
Tom thought Mary was right .
Do you have something to say ?
I have a right to know what &apos;s going on here .
I have something else to show you .
Tom isn &apos;t as young as most people think he is .
I bought the book .
She has a cat and two dogs .
It &apos;s all in the room .
You should leave at once .
Look at that one there .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
Tom plans to go visit Mary in Boston one of these days .
It &apos;s not very durable .
Tell me what you know .
Is it far away ?
We have enough food .
Tom wants to talk .
Can you call him ?
I don &apos;t know why you want me to do that .
What does he say ?
Tom speaks French much better than English .
I have a brother in Boston .
I take pride in what I do .
Here are your keys .
Don &apos;t be too long .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
Maybe we should ask Tom if he wants this old piano .
I shouldn &apos;t worry .
Tom had a lot of things to do .
It is difficult for me .
I want to start now .
Tom shouldn &apos;t leave early again .
It is a good cake .
How &apos;s the world treating you ?
He will be here all evening .
Even when I was a child , I was able to swim well .
He &apos;s two years older than Mary is .
I &apos;m an old woman .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
What &apos;s going on with Tom ?
Tom is the one who wants to wait .
What are Tom and I supposed to do with that ?
You &apos;re rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I gave her just what she needed .
I &apos;m not saying Tom is right .
If you want to , we &apos;ll go .
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
When do you think Tom is going to do that ?
Anything is possible .
He went to America .
This is my sister , Mary .
I &apos;m the one who told Tom about your party .
It &apos;s still alive .
Which side won ?
Tom looks busy .
What is the matter with you ?
What does Tom have ?
Where is my clock ?
I wonder what happened to Tom .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
What do you want to say to Tom ?
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a long time .
Let &apos;s talk .
What have you taken ?
What &apos;s the weather like in Boston ?
Shut the door tight .
I don &apos;t remember anything .
I don &apos;t think children should drink beer .
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river .
I couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
The car is ready .
It &apos;s just money .
I know exactly who it is .
What kind of food do you like to eat ?
Does Tom have long hair ?
I said there &apos;s no one here .
There are a lot of questions that need answering .
Who else is going to be at the party ?
We know who you are .
He deserved it .
It &apos;s part of the job .
Tom came by .
Tom has no choice but to remain .
Tom is worried about me .
I don &apos;t have a son named Tom .
I hope that &apos;s true .
Are you with Tom ?
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
He got up early this morning .
Don &apos;t come .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
I have nothing to say .
Tom ran into the house .
I fell in love .
Tom just wanted to ask Mary a few questions .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
I feel well today .
Why are you really here ?
Tom was angry with his son .
Tom said he was too busy to help Mary do that .
They &apos;re running without shoes .
I don &apos;t know what to do anymore .
We &apos;re always right .
They made me go there .
Can you swim underwater ?
I think you know what I mean .
I have nothing to do now .
I know you better than your wife does .
Tom is going to need my help .
It happened in Boston .
An error was made .
Tom loves doing this .
Tom is correct .
I think I &apos;d like to be your friend .
She &apos;s not as tall as him .
Why weren &apos;t you here yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go to a movie .
I &apos;m terrible at speaking French .
Were you going to the railway station when I saw you ?
Tom isn &apos;t the one who did this .
I have time tomorrow morning .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
Aren &apos;t we friends ?
I still have a lot to learn .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia yet .
It &apos;s impossible to fix it .
Tom needed work .
We &apos;re just looking around .
How much money did you win ?
I think I love you .
What happened to you last night ?
Can I use this bike ?
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t do that .
You never do anything right , do you ?
They &apos;ll be looking for Tom .
I am poor at swimming .
Tom and I have to leave .
I won &apos;t forget you , Tom .
I &apos;ll drink to that .
What needs to be done ?
This is my father .
Did Tom speak French to you ?
Why are you pretending you don &apos;t know me ?
It is almost three .
Tom is coming to see me .
I &apos;ll give it to you tomorrow .
The cat is sleeping on the table .
I can &apos;t show you .
I &apos;m in trouble . I need your help .
Who is that woman ?
Where did you get all this from ?
Tom can hardly see without his glasses .
Do you have any more questions ?
Can you help ?
They were really cold .
Tom might know something .
It won &apos;t happen to me .
Who are they ?
I can &apos;t think of his name just now .
I &apos;d never marry someone like that .
Tom is going to school in Boston .
Who do you have to do that with ?
Turn it off .
Tom said that he was very hungry .
Why is Tom &apos;s car still here ?
This bed is too hard to sleep on .
This is going to be easy .
She makes a good living .
Do you want me to help you do that ?
Do you think Tom stole that ?
He came just as I was leaving .
I heard someone opening the door .
I just want a little more space .
His mother sat up all night waiting for her son .
Tom never raises his voice .
What &apos;re you doing with my car ?
She thought for a few minutes .
We still have time .
We shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom is coming to Boston .
You &apos;re not like me .
How old are your kids ?
How can it be ?
He has no wife , no children and no friends .
I have a book .
You &apos;re only deceiving yourself .
Did Tom ever talk about his father ?
Let &apos;s study English .
He was alone there .
He bought it for five dollars .
I was too small .
I met him yesterday .
I want to know why I &apos;m here .
I was very busy this week .
It &apos;s not a good idea .
It might rain .
Tom never visited Mary .
Why are you so nice to everyone ?
Every boy here has a girlfriend .
Both Tom and I are teachers .
I &apos;ve got a knife .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
Tom is lucky he has so many friends .
Tom likes music .
I am afraid .
Please repeat after me .
Tom took Mary to the park .
People don &apos;t do that .
He doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
He would give an arm and a leg for that .
Come on home .
That &apos;s not how it is .
My watch is ten minutes fast .
Has Tom come ?
Tom &apos;s not happy with that .
What happened here ?
Our company has a long , long history .
Where &apos;s Tom going with Mary ?
I never said that .
When did you finish writing the letter ?
The restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t so expensive .
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
Do you have enough time to do that ?
Tom was asking for it .
You are telling it second hand , aren &apos;t you ?
Why don &apos;t you just forget it ?
Can &apos;t you speak English ?
Tom is a good French speaker .
We see each other once a month .
Nobody wants to be around Tom .
He &apos;ll win for sure .
You should ask Tom first .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
I can see it in your eyes .
Tom had never been to Boston .
Tom is busy .
That &apos;s my suitcase .
Do you have a vacancy ?
I &apos;ve got nothing left .
He told me a long story .
Anyone can see that .
I &apos;m not very good at French .
My father is out in the garden now .
I don &apos;t want to come to Boston .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to me ?
We want to take it .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
I &apos;m not going to work with you today .
I &apos;d like you to be there .
She extended her stay by five days .
Tom and Mary have a son .
Could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
Listen carefully to what I say .
Tom won &apos;t like it in Australia .
You &apos;d better stay here .
Tom always does that in the summer .
My English is not good at all .
We know who they are .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
You have him there .
Tom knows no French .
The world is full of problems .
What kind of movie do you want to watch ?
Don &apos;t take things so seriously .
What else could we expect ?
Tom was the one .
I thought Tom was still in jail .
I &apos;ve lost all my money .
Tom doesn &apos;t want one .
Can I help you ?
I ate too much .
Tom stopped in front of Mary &apos;s house and got out of his car .
Can someone explain how this always happens ?
It is easy to answer the question .
It wasn &apos;t ours .
A boy came running towards me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
We &apos;re busy .
Now you &apos;ve hurt my feelings .
Tom said he thought he &apos;d be able to do that today .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
You are not at all what I expected .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
I know you like Tom .
I let him go .
For me , it &apos;s important .
Tom works fast .
I still can &apos;t believe it !
Tom didn &apos;t need to take a taxi . He could have walked .
I won &apos;t talk to you .
You know what I &apos;m doing .
For me , time is not money .
My friends didn &apos;t do that .
Everybody knows his name .
I &apos;m free today .
I think you &apos;re right .
All my friends will be there .
You don &apos;t have to do what Tom says .
I &apos;m the one you want .
Could you tell me something about yourself ?
I can &apos;t run as fast as he can .
Thank you for coming .
I told you this was going to be interesting .
That restaurant &apos;s too expensive .
Tom is playing with Mary &apos;s cat .
Some people like summer , and others like winter .
How long has Tom been living in Boston ?
Why don &apos;t you just apologize ?
Nobody was to blame for the accident .
He was angry with his son .
He kept us waiting for more than an hour .
That didn &apos;t help us .
Tom isn &apos;t with me .
Do you want me to go with you ?
Why have you been avoiding me ?
Tom might hear you .
I hope war doesn &apos;t break out .
It is said that he was very rich .
Did Tom find it ?
It &apos;s very hard to understand .
You &apos;re going to have to do that .
He went out of the room .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
You still have to pay for it .
I have to go back to the office .
Do you want wine ?
Did you guys hear what Tom said on TV ?
I &apos;m really bad at doing stuff like this .
I think someone &apos;s at the door .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
Tom believes everything that Mary says .
Today both of you are staying home .
Where are we eating tonight ?
I still want to hear Tom &apos;s opinion .
The problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
You may do that if you &apos;d like to .
I couldn &apos;t sleep .
I enjoyed watching the movie .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom would like nothing more than to tell Mary everything .
You have a problem .
What is it you need ?
He came here again .
I &apos;m not too good at this game .
I have one of those , too .
I &apos;m already tired .
You can believe me .
Tom has thought of everything .
You cannot lose .
Tom knows he should do it , but he doesn &apos;t want to .
Let &apos;s meet on Monday .
I wrote a letter to my teacher .
You are entirely correct .
We can make this work .
Who said I stole the money ?
Did you receive my letter ?
You should leave at once .
Did you speak French yesterday ?
What &apos;s his name again ?
You know what to do .
You don &apos;t have the right .
I see what the problem is .
Is this car yours ?
Why are people scared of you ?
I was so worried about you .
We &apos;re sorry .
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him .
Have you already started learning French ?
What &apos;s your opinion ?
That ended better than I expected .
I have good news for you .
Mary is Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
What &apos;s your location ?
You &apos;re interesting .
He is very careful .
Tom needs your love .
I can &apos;t go home .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s why Tom isn &apos;t here .
You went to the park yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
She opened the door .
I can &apos;t play piano .
It was you that made the mistake !
It &apos;s very good .
Tom and Mary have an understanding .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to wait .
I cannot tell you everything that happened to me yesterday .
Have you already eaten ?
Tom wasn &apos;t in the office .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
We do not know him .
Tom can &apos;t walk anymore .
I don &apos;t want to live alone .
How are things ?
What does Tom want to eat ?
You have to get him to help you .
You don &apos;t have a key , do you ?
The house is owned by him .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows exactly how that happened .
Tom has made a lot of new friends .
I knew better than to ask questions .
Everything that Tom said is true .
Tom &apos;s French has improved .
He is proud of never having been late for school .
I got my bicycle repaired .
I &apos;m happy to be here again .
I know that I &apos;m right .
Do you think Tom wants to go to Boston with us ?
I should &apos;ve said that .
Why are we still talking about this ?
Tom went back outside .
This is all our fault .
I &apos;ve learned a good deal from you .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
I don &apos;t like homework .
We &apos;re having a conference .
I &apos;ve lost my glasses .
You &apos;ve come too early .
Tom does what he wants .
This guitar is so expensive that I can &apos;t buy it .
I thought you &apos;d ask that .
No one goes there anymore .
I will quit smoking for good .
We &apos;d better find it .
Tom gave Mary something that she needed .
It &apos;s already late .
How many boys are there in this class ?
What &apos;ll happen to us now ?
We don &apos;t want it .
I want to buy a shirt for my brother .
Do you want that ?
What are you going to say ?
Why are your eyes so big ?
The woman is beautiful .
I haven &apos;t eaten in three days .
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
You always have to have the last word , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t know which is which .
Tom is used to talking to children .
What do you think of it ?
Can you do this problem ?
Tom wasn &apos;t telling the truth about where he &apos;d been .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to me .
I was hardly able to see it .
I hope that he will succeed .
They went hand in hand .
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Who is the man who was talking with you ?
I could actually see myself living here .
I have no time to see you .
Tom is never satisfied .
I didn &apos;t get much .
Please teach me how to do that .
That &apos;s your answer for everything , isn &apos;t it ?
I think I &apos;ll go to Boston next weekend .
His story may not be true .
I think it &apos;d be fun .
I can &apos;t go on pretending like nothing happened .
I &apos;m leaving today .
We all know that Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Tom is trying .
It &apos;s going to be difficult to find somebody to do that for you .
It worked .
We &apos;ll give it a shot .
I can only tell you what I know .
Tell me why you did it .
We don &apos;t have a garden .
They &apos;re angry .
They are my friends .
I want to go to another country .
The two of them got back together .
I would like to see my father .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
We &apos;re leaving .
Tom always says what he thinks .
I &apos;m really not supposed to do this .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
Did Tom say anything before he died ?
Tom is a little nuts .
Where &apos;s your mother ?
We do know what to expect .
I want to know how this happened and why .
She has a bicycle .
Tom stayed outside .
Tom and Mary are moving next month .
How hungry are you ?
I like Australia .
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
When do you usually go to bed ?
I &apos;m probably going to be busy soon .
She gave him some food .
We &apos;d better go back a little .
You can &apos;t have left it at the airport .
He could die .
She will care for you from now on .
I don &apos;t have all day .
We &apos;ll see you .
Sit down , please .
We need your help .
We &apos;ll take good care of Tom .
Tom was in the room .
Do you know what this says ?
You &apos;re a problem .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re pleased .
Tom is probably cold .
I &apos;m taller than you .
He &apos;s too old for her .
We &apos;ll never make it .
Tom said he wants to go .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that alone .
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone who he really was .
I want to know the reason .
I should learn some French .
You &apos;re going to have to do it .
Do we have enough milk ?
Tom isn &apos;t like the other boys .
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary .
I wish I could stay here with you today .
I never realized how hard it must be to be a woman .
I think it &apos;s time you and Tom went home .
I have a present for you .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ll show you what I can do .
The teacher let the boy go home .
Can you tell me why we need to do this ?
I don &apos;t need a doctor .
I guess Tom forgot to tell you .
Take Tom outside .
Thanks for the food .
It &apos;s not a secret .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t here .
Why exactly would I do that ?
Why did you do that ?
What does Tom really want ?
I wanted to be with you .
Would you like more coffee ?
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
Tom invited Mary to dinner .
How long does it take to get to the station ?
He is free from care .
I think Tom has made a mistake .
They need help .
Somebody &apos;s made a mistake .
Tom seems to like talking about himself .
Tom still writes to me from time to time .
She was born last year .
Tom made only three mistakes .
That &apos;s another story .
The story about Tom eating my cat isn &apos;t true .
Tom is making us do this .
Tom made a decision .
When did you learn how to swim ?
I don &apos;t often go to Boston , but every time I do , I enjoy it a lot .
Can you direct me to the train station ?
You have to call Tom .
You should phone Tom .
Let me sleep for another ten minutes .
We don &apos;t know Tom .
None of us knew the answer .
He will not be back tomorrow .
Don &apos;t you want to see Tom ?
Tom has just finished eating dinner .
I don &apos;t want to talk about the weather .
We don &apos;t have a chance .
I can &apos;t call anyone right now .
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
You aren &apos;t rich .
I wish it would stop raining .
This house is very good .
It &apos;s a small school . Everyone knows everyone .
Please come .
The store is just across from my house .
I left right away .
I want some cake .
She talked about her family .
Try harder tomorrow .
I have something to tell you .
When do you leave for school ?
I like my school .
We should get going .
I think I &apos;ll walk to school today .
Everybody is waiting for you .
Why did you say such a thing ?
The boss has a good opinion of your work .
The man is eating bread .
This is no longer funny .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long the party is going to last .
We were friends .
Tom knows what to expect .
When did you learn to swim ?
How did you come by the money ?
That &apos;s nothing to be proud of .
She is now making coffee in the kitchen .
I have to leave you .
No one knows his real name .
Do you think that Tom is happy ?
How about a cup of coffee ?
You were up all night , weren &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s got to be now .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
He told the truth .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom now lives in Boston .
I &apos;ve never fallen in love with any girl .
They say that he is very rich .
How &apos;s your dad ?
Tom seemed fine .
I still can &apos;t believe it happened .
Why don &apos;t you read a book ?
I like summer better than winter .
I asked her to go to a movie with me .
Can you read it ?
I don &apos;t think I can do anything else .
I need to go back to Australia .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
I ate the apple .
I was too surprised to speak .
Tom couldn &apos;t say anything else .
He &apos;s my age .
It is possible for you to read this book in a few days .
I have a lot of friends to help me .
The book is on the table .
Tom is waiting for the bus .
I &apos;m very worried about you .
He knows lots .
It was your idea .
Tom wanted Mary .
Tom might &apos;ve won .
Here is a letter for you .
I don &apos;t know what has become of the boy .
We finally did it .
We &apos;re getting married .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
Please tell the others everything you &apos;ve just told me .
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus .
I tried really hard .
I eat lunch in that restaurant every day .
That &apos;s what I heard .
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
Are you happy with this ?
Tom and Mary usually speak French together .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s ready .
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were , but that &apos;s not going to happen .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
She didn &apos;t go there yesterday .
Tom paid nothing .
I have no future .
This is your hat , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom was really sick .
She was aching all over .
Can I have a bit more milk ?
I couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Who said that ?
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
I already know how to dance .
From here , I can &apos;t see it .
I asked each boy three questions .
I think we made it .
This must not happen again .
I don &apos;t mind .
Tom bought himself a new car .
They struggled .
I &apos;ve always wanted to do this .
There &apos;s a good chance that what Tom told you isn &apos;t true .
I &apos;m really concerned about your future .
Everything appears to be going well .
You need to apologize .
Has anyone ever told you that you &apos;re beautiful ?
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t feel like drinking beer tonight .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom yet .
Tom &apos;s sorry .
I have to go back to work now .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who I am .
Don &apos;t let Tom near my kids .
Did Tom win again ?
I want to sleep a little more .
She said that she was happy .
Tom has been teaching for thirty years .
The police are looking for Tom .
I don &apos;t think I want that .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re alone .
This road will take you to the station .
I went straight to bed .
I can do it now .
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
Is this your first time here ?
Tom visited us this past weekend .
I can &apos;t say exactly .
We need something to eat .
What &apos;s the name of your dog ?
Tom can help .
I could not understand anything he said .
I heard her singing a song .
Tom forgot his glasses .
I don &apos;t know what they are doing .
They do know what they &apos;re doing .
Here you are .
I know myself very well .
Tom is reading a book in his room .
You should never ask a woman her age .
I &apos;m not happy about this .
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
You made it .
You do look good .
It &apos;s no longer available .
He can &apos;t explain what happened .
He often comes late .
Tom took the job .
I always speak French with Tom .
I haven &apos;t spoken French in three years .
Tom and I were very busy last week .
What have you ever done for us ?
Do what you want .
Who do you think it is ?
We &apos;d better wait until tomorrow .
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
This is our decision .
Mary is like a sister to me .
Tom is very happy in Boston .
Tom must love you .
Tom showed the letter to me .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I met your girlfriend .
Have you seen me dance ?
My sister can swim very fast .
That &apos;s hard to believe .
Tom made a few mistakes on the test .
Do you have anything to eat ?
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework .
I don &apos;t think I want that .
They don &apos;t get along together .
I &apos;m certain .
I never wanted to harm you .
Tom only saw Mary once .
Don &apos;t worry about things that aren &apos;t important .
She met him three years ago .
You &apos;re out of order .
What is there to understand ?
Tom wasn &apos;t hungry .
Tom , please restrain yourself .
They lost their dog .
Tom was waiting .
Tom can help us .
I can &apos;t change what happened .
I don &apos;t want Tom to find me .
No one likes Tom .
She looks very sick .
Tom met with a traffic accident .
This problem can &apos;t be solved with money .
You have one hour .
Tom is having lunch .
I &apos;m no longer married to Tom .
You have to find Tom .
I think I won &apos;t go to work today .
I &apos;m not ready to be a mother .
Tom wouldn &apos;t be afraid .
You should do that right now .
It wasn &apos;t an accident .
She likes nobody and nobody likes her .
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
We have everything here that we need .
Tom had no way of knowing that this would happen .
I really don &apos;t have much time .
He &apos;s angry at the world .
I saw her yesterday .
I think I need to see a doctor .
You have to take this .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along together .
You know there &apos;s no way I can do that without some help , don &apos;t you ?
Where are you going for your holidays this year ?
What would you like for breakfast ?
This movie has a happy ending .
Tom asked his teacher for advice .
She is a friend of my wife &apos;s .
I &apos;ll see you Monday .
You &apos;ll find both of the books interesting .
She takes a taxi from the station to her house .
You never say anything .
He did not speak at all .
Please go to the bank .
I have no idea how it works .
I can &apos;t work for you .
Is there something I could get you ?
How are you going to Boston ?
I &apos;m glad I was there .
Would you like another sandwich ?
What doesn &apos;t Tom know ?
This is one of mine .
Tom isn &apos;t saying why .
I &apos;m giving up smoking .
I &apos;m so proud of you .
Do you want to come sit by me ?
Who &apos;re you looking for ?
Tom couldn &apos;t get his hands on everything he needed .
The book is small .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
Tom knows that he needs to do something , but he &apos;s not sure what .
You need to answer the question .
I &apos;ll be right there .
I don &apos;t know what you want .
Tom is inside the house .
She died yesterday afternoon .
He tried opening the door .
Did you say that I could never win ?
Tom usually goes to school by bicycle .
I appreciate your coming all the way .
I thought you &apos;d never call .
I learn French at school .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ve never heard Tom say anything like that .
I still have work to do .
He was kept waiting for a long time .
When does he get back from his trip ?
What do you want , anyway ?
It &apos;s hard to understand his ideas .
I don &apos;t want to eat any more .
That was your choice .
We get along really well .
I gave you my answer already .
We were very hungry .
Where is Tom from ?
Have you already decided what to do next Sunday ?
I want to be here for you .
Take a taxi to the hotel .
It isn &apos;t a secret .
I will go to America tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know what I should do .
What &apos;ll Tom be doing in Boston ?
Tom plays tennis .
Why was I never told about this ?
Tom is going to like that .
I can &apos;t believe your mom let you go .
They believe you .
I &apos;ll be thinking of you today .
Please feel free to ask questions .
It &apos;s now time for me to go to bed .
Everyone knows me .
Tom is starting to feel a little better .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t swim .
I &apos;ll do that .
I am a man .
Are you sure we &apos;re allowed to do that ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to say what I really think .
I &apos;ve got just about everything I need .
I can &apos;t imagine many people wanting to read this book more than once .
He &apos;s feeling much better .
You know that , don &apos;t you ?
I have run out of money .
What I like is her way of talking .
You don &apos;t actually believe that story ?
We walked to my room .
He &apos;ll take care of that .
How long have you been in this town ?
Tom died very young .
I was asked to wait here .
I met a student from America yesterday .
He came into the room .
I saw an airplane .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
I asked Tom if he was nervous .
Would you like to see my new car ?
You can only use it once .
I like it hot .
Tom and Mary are still together .
Leave it to me .
I &apos;d like to go to the movies .
That looks like Tom .
I like to ride on trains .
Tom is always like that .
I want you to leave my house .
Tom went missing .
I want to travel to Australia .
I just want to get it over with .
I &apos;m a little cold .
Here &apos;s your dog .
I &apos;ll give it to Tom .
His name is Tom and he &apos;s Mary &apos;s brother .
Take Tom downtown .
Tom sat with Mary on a bench .
Why are we moving ?
I asked Tom what he thought of Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t strong .
I don &apos;t care about Tom .
You don &apos;t have to answer this question .
Tom wants to drink a cup of coffee .
Tom is just pretending to be sick .
Why haven &apos;t you called ?
You deserved it .
It &apos;s 3 : 30 .
Thanks for being here .
What do you think it says ?
I know these students .
Let &apos;s go for a drink .
Why aren &apos;t they coming ?
Father came home .
He thinks of nothing but himself .
We need to talk about this .
I think I understand you .
I want a picture of that dog .
I hope they throw Tom in jail .
Someone is in the kitchen with Tom .
What do you want to eat ?
I &apos;ve got a wife and three children .
It &apos;s you that she loves , not me .
They have their own troubles .
Tell me where Tom lives .
Tom seems to know his stuff .
I called you this afternoon .
Tom asked Mary some questions that she didn &apos;t want to answer .
He had a new idea .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
The train leaves in ten minutes .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
He was underwater for three minutes .
Are you sure you didn &apos;t do anything ?
I got Tom to help .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom and Mary were told to stay in their room .
You made me do it .
Tom never asked why .
Is this your glass or your sister &apos;s ?
If you don &apos;t want to stay , you don &apos;t have to .
America is very big .
They &apos;re afraid of him .
I worry about my future .
She was so tired that she couldn &apos;t walk .
Tom was disappointed .
He wants an apple .
There &apos;s nobody there .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
What do you have for me today ?
Was that all you saw ?
Listen to me .
Tom likes me .
Have you finished yet ?
Tom and Mary were able to figure it out on their own .
He is quite right .
Are you through with the book ?
We &apos;re going to go .
I &apos;m not going to answer that question .
He must find work .
He cannot swim .
You &apos;re not bad at this .
He could not bring himself to believe her story .
After you &apos;ve eaten , you should get some sleep .
Tom is about the same height as you .
What are you going to do next Sunday ?
Tom lives with us .
I remember the first time .
You &apos;ve already made your decision , haven &apos;t you ?
She is eating .
You need not do it at once .
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
Tom did exactly as he was told .
You &apos;re a good father .
You shouldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears .
How are you today ?
His English is better than mine .
My father is here .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
How many days did you spend in Boston ?
We &apos;re eating apples .
Can we get this over with , please ?
I know those girls .
It &apos;s not that interesting .
We shouldn &apos;t have left Tom alone .
They made me do it .
We have to start at once .
I know a lot of languages .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
This needs to change .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I saw them yesterday .
I can &apos;t go to work in these clothes .
We &apos;re just friends ?
This is my sister &apos;s camera .
I got up early in the morning .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary told John .
Tom knows something we don &apos;t .
I must buy one .
He appeared hungry .
When is a good time for you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been back here for years .
My mother was in the hospital during the summer .
Do you want to do it right now ?
He moved out of his parents &apos; place .
We are boiling water .
Tom is old enough to know better .
Did you really say that ?
We should help Tom .
She dumped me .
This is one of mine .
Boston is my home now .
That &apos;s a good school .
I had a dog when I was a kid .
I did it .
Are these your own books ?
Tom looked hungry .
Tom took off for home .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
Tom opened his eyes .
He doesn &apos;t get jokes .
I was up all night studying .
Tom would like to study French .
Tom likes being alone .
Tom and Mary have gone .
She has a lot of money .
This is how it happened .
I can &apos;t hear anything at all .
Tom is here because of me .
Anyone can do it easily .
How do you do ?
Tom pulled the trigger .
Are you alone right now ?
What &apos;s wrong with this ?
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
It might be a long time before we meet again .
I have no idea why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Go to sleep .
Don &apos;t ever do it again .
What did you tell Tom about it ?
He showed me his new car .
I thought I could count on you .
Tom should arrive in a few minutes .
No one speaks with me .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
You don &apos;t really care , do you ?
I &apos;ve been very busy since this morning .
Do you know why that happens ?
I &apos;m very happy about it .
Why didn &apos;t you visit Boston ?
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
How did all this come about ?
They were friends .
I wouldn &apos;t have done that if I were you .
See you in Boston .
Tom really enjoys his job .
Should I really do it ?
I &apos;d like to see what &apos;s going on .
Where did you buy this guitar ?
We no longer need you .
She dislikes going to school .
Tom writes everything down .
May I ask you some more questions ?
Can you read this without your glasses ?
I know that Tom was at your house today .
If anyone can do that , it &apos;s Tom .
I love my home .
Thank you for not saying anything .
Tom could &apos;ve said something .
I plan to go . I don &apos;t care if you do or not .
He fell asleep under the tree .
We are invited to dinner .
I &apos;m not going to ask you again .
I &apos;ll show you around town .
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened .
Where is the book ?
He has two cats .
I don &apos;t believe you .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
Why didn &apos;t you call me sooner ?
Tom thought that Mary was asleep .
Listen to your father , Tom .
What &apos;ll you have for dinner tonight ?
Do you know when he will come ?
It &apos;s no use asking him for help .
I &apos;ve never been abroad .
She is about as tall as me .
Tom deserved it .
Tom is writing again .
Tom didn &apos;t come home last night .
Tom seems to always be busy .
Did you understand what he said ?
There is a dictionary on the desk .
I &apos;m losing weight .
My apartment is too small .
Return immediately .
Mary is still living at home with her parents .
Who &apos;s the girl at the door ?
Tom wants to know what &apos;s going on .
He might come tomorrow .
That makes me very happy .
You had no choice but to do it .
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
This car is older than I am .
Tom had no idea who Mary &apos;s father was .
They were completely surprised .
Who gave this to you ?
He is reading a book .
You know what Tom said , don &apos;t you ?
You don &apos;t need to answer that question .
I think Tom is rich .
How tall you are !
Nobody wants you to do this .
He can run fast .
You need not have come so early .
I will go out when I have finished this work .
It &apos;s difficult for me to understand French when it &apos;s spoken quickly .
Would you mind not doing that ?
Maybe what Tom said was true .
Where are your children ?
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
How do you like this town ?
Tom came to see you this afternoon .
Little remains to be done .
Where is his family ?
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary .
Tom is so happy .
Do you know how much Tom gets paid to do that ?
It won &apos;t work .
He does not like tennis .
Children should play outside .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me anything about you .
What else can I do for you ?
Are they in love ?
I wish it had never happened .
He walks his dog every morning .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
Where can I buy apples ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I asked him to open the window .
My mother gets up earlier than I do .
I must finish my homework before dinner .
Who could forget it ?
Tom is coming for dinner . Do you want to stay ?
What am I going to do without Tom ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom is doing that .
We &apos;ll wait .
This wouldn &apos;t be about Tom , would it ?
I don &apos;t know who she is .
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to do that .
I &apos;m not ready for it yet .
What &apos;s the sense of working so hard ?
That &apos;s how Tom likes it .
I &apos;ve just arrived .
How does the song go ?
What &apos;s on TV now ?
We &apos;re in the process of writing the report now .
I went to Boston by train .
They invited me to dinner .
If you eat that you will die .
Can you see that ?
How rich is Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t sleepy .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
I think we &apos;d better go .
Give me your watch .
She avoids me .
He could do it .
I voted for you .
I did nothing all day .
Tom &apos;s death was an accident .
Nobody does it better .
I &apos;m making coffee .
There are a lot of people here .
They don &apos;t like cats .
We should give Tom a chance .
You weren &apos;t there .
I find it difficult to believe .
Tom and Mary are young .
Play another song for us .
I always have something to do .
I need to ask you some more questions .
I know what &apos;s up .
Perhaps you &apos;re trying too hard .
We need to talk .
How is it ?
Tom put a cup of coffee in front of Mary .
I can &apos;t live like this anymore .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m agreeing with you .
The table takes up a lot of space in this room .
I &apos;m right behind you .
Someone stole Tom &apos;s money .
I take the bus to work every day .
Don &apos;t listen to her .
I &apos;m happy to have you as a student .
I &apos;m so sorry about that .
Are you afraid of me ?
Tom knew exactly what he was doing .
We have a long way to go .
Tom called a cab for Mary .
He comes here every five days .
I knew that .
Please promise you &apos;ll never do that again .
He &apos;s been sick in bed for four days .
Do you want to leave now ?
I love my son .
Do you know how to do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t understand French .
It is up to you .
We &apos;re almost there .
I want to know why .
Do you have a family ?
Tom isn &apos;t as good at speaking French as you think he is .
I think that &apos;ll do .
I already did that .
Tom wrote Mary a letter .
Do you have a son ?
I can &apos;t explain how it is .
I wanted to introduce you to Tom .
I really must have my watch repaired .
She spoke to him about the matter .
Would you care for another glass of beer ?
I gave my word .
Do we have one ?
I can &apos;t think straight .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
I wish I &apos;d been here three hours ago .
Have you read this yet ?
Please tell Tom Mary called .
Don &apos;t stop .
I &apos;d like you to help me do that .
Tom isn &apos;t tall .
She &apos;s not a good person .
My mother is out there .
Tom is too loud .
I can &apos;t do anything about it .
We need to speak to Tom again .
Give him time .
Tom realized he had no choice .
What did Tom write ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like my friends .
How do you like your new class ?
Tom got up early this morning .
Tom started studying French last year .
Nobody was home .
Is this what Tom wants ?
I &apos;m very happy about that .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Why did you allow it to happen ?
You can &apos;t make everyone happy all the time .
He went to bed .
Please find Tom .
He pretended to be a doctor .
Do you want me to go with Tom ?
Is that from Tom ?
Her voice sounds very beautiful .
Tom understands .
I gave her her dictionary back .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better .
I don &apos;t think Tom is home .
When I hear this song , I think of Tom .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Tom ran to catch the last train .
Have you ever written a book ?
We don &apos;t have much choice .
Tom has a son not much older than Mary .
Is this your wine ?
I thought you &apos;d wear something like that .
You can play outside if you want to .
Tom has a son .
Tom put the children to bed .
My hotel told me to call you .
I was the one who said we should wait .
What type of job are you looking for ?
You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
You &apos;ve just missed Tom .
I will do it gladly .
Are you sure you can afford this ?
Tom was hurt in the accident .
I wrote this song for Tom .
Tom said something in French that I couldn &apos;t understand .
Tom &apos;s mother is a very good cook .
Tom wanted to go to the beach .
I &apos;m hoping that doesn &apos;t happen .
He looks old , but he hasn &apos;t reached 30 yet .
We &apos;ll help you .
Such things happen all the time .
We tell each other everything .
Tom didn &apos;t try to go any further .
Tom didn &apos;t speak .
Tom didn &apos;t buy any bread .
Tom is kind of tired . He wants to go home .
Is this Tom &apos;s book ?
Did you invite him ?
Tom asked me if I knew his father .
I &apos;m mad at both of you .
What can you tell me about this ?
I wonder what made Tom think I wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
Tom simply wasn &apos;t quick enough .
I don &apos;t want to go outside on a day like this .
I &apos;ll go tell Tom .
That wasn &apos;t Tom .
We want to make absolutely sure that Tom wants to do that .
I &apos;m not sure I want that .
I don &apos;t see Tom .
Tom spent three years in jail .
I &apos;ll call you in an hour .
Just give it up , Tom .
Can you come to the office by train ?
I had nothing left to eat .
You must eat .
They &apos;re expecting you .
Tom is back in Boston .
He attempted suicide .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is right .
I want to do it right .
My horse is white .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed yet .
Things are looking good .
Why do you want to help the police ?
We must be careful .
I don &apos;t know for certain when he will come .
It &apos;s your money , isn &apos;t it ?
I didn &apos;t say anything .
He is the very man that we &apos;ve been looking for .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time .
You know Tom likes Boston .
How did you and your wife meet ?
I waited for a reply .
Did you watch the movie ?
How would you like your coffee ?
She suggested that he try it .
It is a little cold .
Tom can &apos;t cook .
Have you tried it yet ?
She ran as fast as possible .
How did Tom get to be so rich ?
He can only speak a little English .
Tom knew it was impossible .
Here is your dog . Where is mine ?
May I have a word with you ?
Tom was alone .
Can you manage to carry the suitcase by yourself ?
My brother is coming on Monday .
They &apos;re doing it now .
What &apos;ll Tom think ?
I need to open this door .
You might want to ask Tom to help you .
Tom was sitting behind me .
We could understand each other .
I needed more money .
Tom is just three years older than me .
My camera is different from yours .
I know you &apos;ll like Tom .
She refused his offer .
I no longer like you .
I &apos;m busy doing homework .
We have lunch at about noon .
I feel something .
I wrote down his phone number .
Tom gives us what we want .
Tom wasn &apos;t bad .
How do you know that &apos;s where Tom is now ?
I want to go to Boston .
He may have read the letter .
Tom went to bed .
I don &apos;t think so .
Did you buy a new car ?
Boston is where I want to go .
I don &apos;t ever go there anymore .
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
They &apos;re coming .
She should know better at her age .
Please come home as quickly as possible .
What &apos;ll you do with Tom ?
May I do that with Tom ?
I &apos;ll show you what I can do .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants you to do .
I thought that was the case .
I &apos;ll stay with you until Tom gets here .
Let me leave !
Where are you folks from ?
I &apos;m a little nervous .
He became rich overnight .
I &apos;m not understanding anything .
I &apos;d rather not do that .
She hasn &apos;t come yet .
I heard you singing .
He did it just for fun .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed .
It &apos;s morning .
You &apos;re always drinking alone .
I know what you did .
Money can &apos;t buy friends .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
How old are your kids ?
Let me look into it .
I &apos;m always very nervous .
Tom wants to learn how to talk to girls .
You live and learn .
She helped cook lunch .
No one &apos;s listening .
Is it hard to speak English ?
I cared about Tom .
We lost sight of him .
You &apos;re in danger , Tom .
I told her to sit down and drink a glass of water .
The boy is nice .
I saw that one .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have kept Mary waiting so long .
I &apos;m right , aren &apos;t I ?
Give me that one .
I wanted to introduce you to Tom .
May I show you something ?
What made you think Tom did that ?
I still haven &apos;t told Tom .
Isn &apos;t there something else we can do ?
You may call on me whenever you like .
Just give us a couple of minutes .
Tom wants to become a teacher .
They &apos;re right behind me .
She must have been very beautiful .
What &apos;s Tom look like ?
I understand it .
You asked for our help .
Have you finished reading the book ?
Nobody deserves to die like that .
We should &apos;ve thought of this before .
I didn &apos;t know what was happening .
They &apos;ve never met .
I want to talk to you .
He is still in bed .
A child could not have understood the situation .
Tom has long hair .
This book is available at one shop only .
Tom made his bed .
I don &apos;t know her telephone number .
Have you read the book Tom bought for you ?
I don &apos;t think this is funny .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this .
Her sister looks young .
I didn &apos;t think it was a big deal .
Something has happened to this clock .
I don &apos;t know that for sure .
I think Tom had a good reason .
That &apos;s my sister &apos;s camera .
What do you expect from us ?
Let Tom go .
What makes you say that ?
Tom needed water .
Nobody can help you .
I &apos;ve often heard about you .
Now I remember .
This book is too expensive . I can &apos;t afford to buy it .
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
Why are Tom and Mary here ?
We will come together .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I never did that .
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
What about Tom ?
I found the book easy .
You will come to like this kind of music .
Do you want to do it with me ?
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
I can &apos;t really remember .
I like this house as it is .
She testified against him .
I can &apos;t imagine life without Tom .
I didn &apos;t see anyone studying .
I &apos;m all alone here .
No one knew that but Tom .
I can say whatever I wish .
Tom wants to talk to you .
I &apos;m never going to leave you again .
It was Tom &apos;s idea , not mine . Don &apos;t blame me .
You &apos;re free to go .
I had no difficulty in finding your office .
I wonder what Tom is doing now .
She &apos;s not as tall as he is .
Tom likes to listen to music .
Christmas comes but once a year .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
She invited me over for coffee .
They &apos;re all scared of Tom .
They &apos;re going to do it .
Tom has a girlfriend .
Who found you ?
Tom sat down next to Mary .
You must take care of the dog .
I told you so .
I did no such thing .
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
We don &apos;t have any time to waste .
Everything had happened so quickly .
I &apos;m going to the bank .
My brother has been sick since yesterday .
What were you doing that moment ?
I told Tom to do that .
What more could you want ?
We have a lot of snow in the winter .
I don &apos;t want to believe you .
I want Tom to succeed .
She &apos;s my wife .
Don &apos;t give Tom what he wants .
I didn &apos;t have anything to drink .
Don &apos;t be a stranger .
Tom took off his shirt .
Please call me Tom .
Tom told me that he was very tired .
Tom loves telling the story about how he and Mary met .
Maybe we shouldn &apos;t have gotten married .
Isn &apos;t that good news ?
I want to write a book .
Tom likes watching TV .
Don &apos;t worry about it !
Tom seemed to know what he was doing .
Why do you want that ?
That is very expensive !
Tom asked a few questions .
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do .
Do you want another cup of coffee ?
The train is leaving soon .
It is a good idea to read this book .
I won &apos;t talk to you .
Leave your desk as it is .
Tom didn &apos;t even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee .
What pretty eyes you have !
There used to be a large park here .
I think Tom is going to call you .
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
I can &apos;t believe I forgot .
Where did you see that woman ?
The store is close to my house .
Who is the man who was talking with you ?
Tom stayed home all day .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with you .
I &apos;ll study French , too .
What &apos;s wrong ?
What do you call this in French ?
What do you want me to do ?
I really don &apos;t understand this problem .
I am learning to play the guitar now .
Tom lives here .
You &apos;re big enough to do that by yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom is in Boston now .
I think that he won &apos;t come .
He can &apos;t take a joke .
Tom is too old for you .
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
Tom and I are students .
You can &apos;t really think this is funny .
Did you hear it too ?
You &apos;re the one I love .
The cat loves playing in the garden .
I &apos;ll have what he &apos;s having .
I take a walk every day except when it rains .
Tom hasn &apos;t said anything either .
The children were not to blame for the accident .
I think we need each other .
Tom knows it .
You may talk as much as you like .
I don &apos;t think Tom will be here on time .
Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom .
I can &apos;t understand what happened .
Tom is so strong .
I think we &apos;re ready .
Why don &apos;t you go to bed ?
I don &apos;t know that .
My watch keeps good time .
I &apos;m glad you like our house .
What do you do after school ?
May I ask a favor of you ?
I need my glasses .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was this happy .
I know Tom isn &apos;t your boyfriend .
I didn &apos;t know that you used to work here .
I &apos;ll give you one more chance .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Tom laid himself on the bed .
I know you &apos;ll be happy here .
He pretended not to be listening .
I want eggs .
I like my teachers .
You can &apos;t even help yourself .
It &apos;s not here .
There was nobody here yesterday .
Tom heard that .
Tom has to finish this work by 2 : 30 .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d seen John .
He approached the door .
Tom didn &apos;t have any children .
Tom is going to like being in Boston .
Are there any other questions ?
He wants to be like me .
You don &apos;t need to study today .
She didn &apos;t need to come .
Is Tom in love with you ?
We &apos;ll be here all day .
Tom and I are teachers .
Tom is old enough to drive a car .
I want that job .
We all work .
Can you tell me how to get to the station ?
&quot; Tom is thirty years old . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not really that old , is he ? &quot;
It &apos;s up to you and me .
I &apos;m in no position to help you .
Tom fell asleep .
They left without me .
Can I open the window ?
Tom wanted to stay at home .
You don &apos;t have to eat .
What have you got to lose ?
I need this money .
What time will we arrive in Boston ?
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
What I say is true .
I had fun at school today .
Has Tom actually ever done that ?
Why are you so nice to everyone ?
How old do you think Tom is ?
I asked you not to play with that .
He works eight hours a day .
He seated himself beside her .
I &apos;m going to get married again .
I had my car stolen last night .
That &apos;s none of your business .
I want to go there once more .
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
It &apos;s dangerous here .
Please be careful .
The man at the door wouldn &apos;t tell me his name .
Why don &apos;t you come with me ?
That is his car .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
You asked for our help .
You should meet Tom .
Tom saved a seat for me .
Tom said he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
Could you do this instead of me ?
Tom didn &apos;t waste any time .
I know a man who speaks French .
Stand aside .
Tom and Mary are fun to be around .
I don &apos;t have that much time left .
He knows how to drive a car .
He speaks English and French .
I can &apos;t believe Tom said that .
I found out what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I made no promises .
She took her book .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
You may not want to know .
Tom left for a second .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a clue .
We know we &apos;ve got big problems .
I think Tom and Mary are in love .
Are you a teacher or a student ?
I know that Tom is infuriated .
I can &apos;t do that .
The ship set sail .
Tom doesn &apos;t look good .
How could it be ?
Do you want me to help you do that ?
You know I have to go .
Tom was strong .
Do you think he will like that ?
Are you important ?
Would you like some ?
Please have someone else do that .
How did it happen ?
He said nothing , which made her angry .
We live in the United States .
The meeting was well attended .
Tom helped me do my homework .
I love Tom .
I &apos;ve got nothing .
I was in favor of going and they were in favor of staying .
I know that Tom loves you .
Tom is in his room .
There &apos;s nothing left to be done .
Tom has to go see Mary .
No one can know everything .
He says that he enjoyed it very much .
We didn &apos;t say anything .
Tom knows that everything Mary is saying is true .
I think Tom already knows .
She spent more money than usual .
Tom told Mary why he was late .
You are late .
Tom had nothing to do .
Don &apos;t kid yourself .
What did you say his name was ?
Tom started reading .
You might have to do this all by yourself .
It is easy to answer this question .
She has never visited him .
You are a teacher .
She was only half alive .
I like it very much .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t able to do anything .
What else did Tom say ?
Were you expecting something else ?
He has been dead for three years .
Tom should be in bed .
You &apos;ve got my phone .
I hope to see you soon .
I don &apos;t think you tried hard enough .
Tom probably isn &apos;t watching TV now .
Tom is a head taller than me .
A penny for your thoughts .
I don &apos;t want to have children .
Who was the girl you were talking to ?
Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
I just told Tom .
Let &apos;s not forget who Tom is .
What do you know about this ?
He stood up .
I don &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t need to do that .
Tom is small .
Tom knows what &apos;s up .
Tom doesn &apos;t care whether Mary does her homework or not .
I made that for Tom .
How did you get Tom to do that for you ?
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
Tom still hasn &apos;t come back .
I need to sit down .
Tom came over and helped me .
Tom pretended to be a doctor .
I don &apos;t swim as well as you do .
Tom prefers to stay home .
They &apos;re nervous .
Do you want to take that ?
Your French is good .
More needs to be done .
It was hot in the room .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
It &apos;s all over .
You are my father .
Can I give you a piece of advice ?
I think it &apos;ll be OK .
I have already read today &apos;s paper .
He &apos;s never been in love before .
Why did you say such a thing to him ?
Tom is teaching us French .
I don &apos;t know that yet .
Tom came along soon after .
None of the other kids want to play with Tom .
Tom was sitting beside Mary .
You should &apos;ve come to the party .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve found you .
Now I &apos;m ready .
How do you say &quot; love &quot; in French ?
This problem is hard to solve .
Just give me one more chance .
I didn &apos;t say I was in love with Tom .
I think I &apos;ll take it .
I was never in love with Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t rich .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
I spoke with Tom today .
Tom is all alone .
I will show you the picture .
Tom can &apos;t see without his glasses .
I &apos;ll never forget how kind Tom was to everyone .
It &apos;s getting late .
I didn &apos;t need any help doing that .
I &apos;ll give you $ 30 .
I have to look for my friends .
Have you called him yet ?
Tom needs a new pair of glasses .
I was on the bus .
When did Tom say that ?
Children need loving .
I think that &apos;s what it is .
I &apos;m very sorry for being late .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom yet .
Please feel free to ask questions .
That &apos;s for you to do .
That isn &apos;t good .
They aren &apos;t my books .
She did it all by herself .
I saw a man with a child .
It &apos;s going to happen sooner or later .
What I need is not money , but your advice .
The key has to be here somewhere .
I would never do anything like that .
I mean it .
Tom held the door open .
You said that last time .
I &apos;ve been saying that all along .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
I &apos;ll be at home all day tomorrow .
We &apos;re among friends .
I &apos;d like to study with you tonight , but I can &apos;t .
Tom just won .
What &apos;s Tom got ?
Where did you learn that ?
I don &apos;t even have time to read .
Have you already finished your homework ?
I love coming here .
He has no money .
He got into the car and drove off .
Everybody makes mistakes .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I know what love is .
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
I &apos;m not used to going to bed late .
There comes our teacher .
He seldom , if ever , goes to the movies .
She &apos;s six years older than me .
You can call me anytime you like .
I was about your age when I came to Boston .
I think I don &apos;t understand you .
He left the last page blank .
I didn &apos;t know who to give it to .
We were very happy .
He did it for money .
Tom almost looks like a girl .
French is spoken here .
Just let me go .
Tom says that he &apos;s very rich .
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
I could write Tom a note if you want me to .
I can hardly believe his story .
I want to know where Tom lives .
Tom was the only boy in the entire class .
Tom really needs your help .
I only have one friend left .
What made you think that ?
She came with good news .
Your father would have been very proud of you .
They &apos;re looking for you .
I received a letter from my sister .
I don &apos;t want to get into the water .
I hear that his father is abroad .
You should get out once in a while .
We should call Tom .
I found my book .
Where &apos;s my food ?
Did Tom ever hurt you ?
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
Tom is thirty .
I put my hat on .
He seldom stays home on Sundays .
Tom arrived in the nick of time .
You &apos;re not going to like that , are you ?
I love them .
We &apos;ll talk afterwards .
I have already finished reading this book .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I want your money .
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
Tom and I were alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working here .
I can &apos;t say .
I want to know what &apos;s good .
He is no longer a child .
Tom told me what you did .
Has Tom spoken to you about me ?
I &apos;m afraid it will rain .
Have you ever heard Tom sing ?
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
You may give the book to whoever wants it .
I know just what you need .
This is new .
I had nothing else to do .
Tom had no hat on .
I &apos;ll come visit you tomorrow .
It is not so difficult as you think .
There was almost nothing in the room .
Did Tom tell you why he wasn &apos;t at school yesterday ?
What makes you so sure Tom wants to stay ?
This isn &apos;t love .
Why are we walking ?
He looked much better this morning than yesterday .
Tom seems to be getting angry .
I bought a newspaper .
Are you still Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Tom was drunk .
I &apos;ve got no money left .
I &apos;ve never done that before .
What would happen if you didn &apos;t do what Tom told you to ?
Tom read the letter .
Tom has friends .
We can definitely find a cab to take us to the station .
Tom doesn &apos;t know for certain when Mary will come .
Tom sat down on the floor next to Mary .
This clock is accurate .
He worked all day yesterday .
I &apos;m going to stay at home tonight .
It has been six years since I started to study English .
May I speak with you in private ?
I wish I had done more .
Mary is my mother .
Tom couldn &apos;t breathe .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
Tom seems pleased .
You must think for yourselves .
Are you ready to go out ?
I let Tom in the house .
When did I give you that ?
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
How many cats are there in this house ?
You &apos;re busy , aren &apos;t you ?
Let him do it alone .
I &apos;m not going to help Tom .
Can Tom do that ?
Perhaps this is wrong .
What kind of house does Tom live in ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t need money .
They &apos;re watching .
I &apos;m taking a couple of days off .
I called Tom today .
That &apos;s what Tom tells me .
She is having lunch now .
What &apos;ll you do this weekend ?
Can I come over ?
Who will pay ?
Was it fun ?
He made up his mind .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
He says he met my father .
Be on your guard against him .
You &apos;ll love this .
Go and apologize to Tom .
You may still do it if you want to .
Is it that hard ?
Where did you put my passport ?
Where did they learn this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play outside today .
I &apos;ll be here from 2 : 30 until 6 : 30 .
I like apples .
Can you come to the party ?
Where did you guys meet ?
This one &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
What else do you know ?
Everyone is waiting for Tom to say something .
Are they tall ?
Her answer couldn &apos;t be understood .
Tom looked up at the sky .
She opened her eyes .
You were supposed to tell Tom that .
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
I have a high opinion of this book .
I go to school .
Tom is badly wounded .
She kept quiet .
I am really sorry to hear that .
I &apos;d like to have dinner with you .
No one is going to know .
I don &apos;t care what you do with it .
I know your son .
My father is in good health .
That &apos;s what we saw .
Tom might be late .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about it .
I want Tom &apos;s money .
I think I remember how to do that .
Come with me now .
I &apos;ll never be late again .
I never make my bed .
Don &apos;t be late .
Tom is far away .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom studies French every day .
He was the only man .
I am right .
You must be tired .
How long have we been here ?
Things are getting too dangerous around here .
No one &apos;s looking at you .
Tom is better at this than I am .
I wasn &apos;t the only person Tom talked to .
There &apos;s something I forgot to tell you .
We ate eggs .
How often do you go to Boston ?
Tom pretended to not hear a thing .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
Can I eat this bread ?
May I ask a favor of you ?
Tom &apos;ll call .
I have a few friends here .
How was your night ?
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
I &apos;m not sure if this is correct .
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
Are you sure ?
I thought Tom was a doctor .
I would like to help you .
I don &apos;t believe him at all .
It wasn &apos;t very good .
Is it about ten o &apos;clock ?
Thank you for being there .
Tom and Mary have a country house .
I wonder what became of Tom .
Tom seemed surprised .
You never say what you really think .
We can &apos;t help you .
She could not swim .
Is there life before death ?
Tom and Mary often play tennis together .
I &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over .
I can &apos;t believe your mom let you go .
Do you have it with you ?
Tom sat down on the bench .
Tom said he thought that the room was too small .
I was born in October .
The cat is under the sofa .
I can &apos;t change the way Tom is , but that doesn &apos;t stop me from trying .
He looks like his father .
I don &apos;t remember my father anymore .
I want to go to Australia .
Tom is afraid of cats .
Tom said Mary is very happy .
We &apos;re not stopping .
I had him carry my bag .
We have less than three hours .
How long were you and Tom married ?
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday .
Tom is going to love it .
I couldn &apos;t help Tom do that .
I believe Tom will win .
I know nothing about you .
Tom has stopped smoking .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that you knew each other ?
You must on no account do such a thing .
I believe you like your job .
I have often been there .
I have Tom &apos;s keys .
Our work never ends .
What do you have on for tomorrow night ?
I haven &apos;t seen much of Tom recently .
You &apos;re the one that I was looking for .
He &apos;s my brother .
I &apos;ll take Tom home .
I wish I could understand French .
They &apos;re cold .
No one can help you .
That &apos;s not a real word .
Is that Tom &apos;s ?
You have to believe me .
I don &apos;t know anybody in this town .
I was invited by an old friend .
Tom is expected to arrive momentarily .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
We &apos;re going home by car .
No one helped me .
I want something else to read .
I want to do it for you .
My daughter visits me now and then .
They don &apos;t listen .
Is your name Tom ?
Tom is afraid of you .
Perhaps Tom was right about that .
It &apos;s OK with me if it &apos;s OK with you .
I still need to buy some bread .
I hardly understood anything .
Ask Tom if you don &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;m nervous and scared .
I &apos;m tired .
I still want to talk to you .
You are not to leave your room .
I just can &apos;t live without you .
You don &apos;t have to talk to me if you don &apos;t want to .
Take that box away !
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play tennis on Sunday .
I know someone who lives in Boston .
I &apos;m getting good at it .
I fail to understand what the problem is .
My grandfather gets up early .
I &apos;ll go and look for Tom .
Can we come ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any cats .
It &apos;s work .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
Are you sure you want to do it ?
She is in love with him .
I never thought Tom would do it .
Where shall we eat tonight ?
Why do people go to the movies ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming home .
This is me .
Her son will succeed for sure .
Do you have a bicycle ?
Tom deserves this .
You are a schoolteacher , aren &apos;t you ?
Where do you suppose Tom will go ?
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
If Tom goes swimming , so will I .
The job is practically done .
I like fish .
I can scarcely believe it .
He sat beside her on her bed .
She can swim .
It &apos;s now or never .
You have to ask Tom first .
Is your mother at home ?
He did a pretty good job .
Tom is the one who told me your phone number .
Tom got into the car with Mary .
I haven &apos;t been married long .
I don &apos;t know why .
It &apos;s all over between us .
The decision is yours .
What makes you think that I &apos;m against that ?
Only time will tell .
I really should have called .
Tom works all night .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
Where can I buy it ?
Tom stood still and listened .
Tom &apos;s eyesight isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
How did you manage to do that ?
That &apos;s just what you need now .
I told Tom that I wouldn &apos;t win .
How are we going to get home ?
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom got first prize , didn &apos;t he ?
Thank you for helping Tom .
Where do you see the books ?
I can &apos;t find my watch .
Tom will be here today .
Tom knows what Mary wants .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
I &apos;ve thought about you a lot .
We could &apos;ve died .
How can you be so calm ?
There &apos;s nothing in this box .
Tom asked a few good questions .
It makes no difference to me .
The choice is yours , Tom .
What &apos;s the name of your dog ?
There &apos;s something I want you to see .
Tom bought a book .
Tom wanted some food .
We have a cat and a dog .
I don &apos;t like French .
This dictionary is expensive .
This isn &apos;t for you .
I &apos;m not sure .
Do you want to come with us ?
No one &apos;s blaming you .
Do you know what it says ?
I could never live in Boston .
You had better tell me now .
Are Tom and Mary really married ?
Tom wants me to go with him .
I went to bed early because I was tired .
You &apos;re going to do fine .
I believe you like your job .
No way !
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
I &apos;m very happy to be back home .
Do you know how to drive ?
I took the money .
You can do anything you want to .
Tom said Mary isn &apos;t happy .
Tom really likes going to the movies .
Tom told me to talk to Mary about that .
I really couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Tom must &apos;ve left .
I noticed that , too .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
Tom wasn &apos;t very happy .
Are you happy in your house ?
They &apos;re the ones who are paying .
Tom and Mary did their homework together .
I wanted to stay there two days longer .
I &apos;m not allowed to tell you .
She asked him some questions .
Tom said it was no concern of his .
It is pretty cold today .
I think I &apos;m ready .
I don &apos;t like you anymore .
Do you think we &apos;ll reach his house before noon ?
Tom won again .
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
I love you people .
Tom got dressed quickly .
He no longer lives here .
We &apos;d love to work with you .
Your French is hard to understand .
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that .
She came home disappointed .
Tom told her .
Tom has a lot of friends here .
I &apos;m sure Tom will be here soon .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
Tom &apos;s thirtyish .
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture .
Tom didn &apos;t see anything .
It &apos;s supper time .
I don &apos;t understand them .
It is time to go to school .
This was Tom &apos;s idea .
We can &apos;t afford that .
Father can swim , but Mother cannot .
That &apos;s exactly what we need .
This is the case .
I feel sick every morning .
How long was Tom married ?
Look at me when I &apos;m talking to you !
I &apos;d like to have an answer .
I forgot to explain everything to Tom .
I have nothing to do with them .
What &apos;s Tom doing in there ?
Tom was incorrect .
Tom sided with Mary .
Is he your teacher ?
It &apos;s bedtime .
What can you do for me ?
I &apos;ll catch up with you later .
I &apos;ve only just started studying French .
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
Let me introduce my sister to you .
Take your hands off me .
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
What &apos;s the good news ?
Do you want it or not ?
What &apos;s the name of this tune ?
Tom is not my friend anymore .
Tom would rather speak French .
This coat is too small .
Tom knows how to make Mary happy .
I thought Tom was interested .
When will you return ?
You &apos;re too good for Tom .
Are you free this afternoon ?
No matter who says so , I can &apos;t believe that .
You should probably tell Tom what to do .
I know you want to come home .
How are you doing ?
You shouldn &apos;t drink that water .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to be indebted to anyone .
I came as fast as I could .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
I watch TV all day .
Tom will never believe me again .
I still haven &apos;t finished eating breakfast .
I didn &apos;t pay .
Nothing scares me .
What &apos;s going on , Tom ?
I bought this shirt yesterday .
I love you .
That isn &apos;t what I said .
She doesn &apos;t live with him .
We don &apos;t get on well with each other .
We &apos;ve got to start doing that .
You know I hate it .
I &apos;m busy .
Tom said that he &apos;s sorry .
I fell in love with him .
She is rather poor at tennis .
I made it .
Here &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
Your dog is here .
What she said turned out to be false .
Tom knows us very well .
She hardly ever works .
Tom won first prize .
Where are the other girls ?
The man took the boy by the hand .
Whoever is at the door , please ask him to wait .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
He doesn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
You &apos;re a good boy .
Who wrote this story ?
No one is there but Tom .
Tom says that he can &apos;t eat any more .
I learned a lot about Tom from Mary .
It would be nice if it stopped raining .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re all here .
Tom and I got married .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
I need to know .
We don &apos;t want to cause any trouble .
His promise cannot be relied on .
I don &apos;t know if it will rain tomorrow or not .
Let us know whether you can come .
You have to start doing that .
We want to go home .
We &apos;ll bring Tom .
We &apos;re looking for a friend of ours .
I don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s office is .
Tom didn &apos;t want to pay that much .
They feel hungry .
Tom doesn &apos;t look anything like his brother .
I told Tom I couldn &apos;t do it .
Tom saw that Mary wasn &apos;t in the room .
Is she nice ?
You may go home now .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I can do without it .
He comes here almost every day .
Just how long do you think it &apos;ll take to get there ?
Do you have a key to Tom &apos;s apartment ?
Tom has been badly wounded .
That is not the case in Japan .
That car is Tom &apos;s .
There &apos;s still plenty that needs to be done .
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
I should &apos;ve known Tom would be here , too .
Wait , you guys .
Who says that ?
He is said to be rich .
You should &apos;ve told me the truth .
You must start immediately .
What do you think of all this ?
I should &apos;ve explained it better .
You should &apos;ve listened to me .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
Tom checked his watch .
Tom got up at six almost every day .
I have never heard him speak ill of others .
No one listens to me .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
It &apos;s likely to rain tomorrow .
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any plans for tomorrow .
I saw him at the station a few days ago .
I like it when you do that .
I saw nothing .
We don &apos;t speak French .
Aren &apos;t you glad that Tom did that ?
Let &apos;s go home .
I wish it were that simple .
You &apos;re not sleepy , are you ?
Tom loves dogs .
What is it with you and Tom ?
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
Tom is the kind of man I like .
Just go back to the kitchen .
His life is in danger .
Someone called .
They didn &apos;t do anything .
Tom was afraid to go to sleep .
I don &apos;t make mistakes very often .
Do you have any objection ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat , does he ?
Tom knows I can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom &apos;s hands are small .
Is this your bicycle ?
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a long time .
Where can I find a hospital ?
It &apos;s not going to end well .
I just want to ask Tom a few questions .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
Tom got that bicycle from Mary .
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea ?
What does Tom think of this ?
Tom went outside .
Tom said that he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
People like to talk .
You &apos;re too drunk to drive .
Tom seemed angry .
I &apos;ve always wanted to visit another country .
Your shoes are here .
Didn &apos;t you write a letter to him ?
Tom seems as busy as ever .
Why is this happening to me ?
There isn &apos;t much time left .
I &apos;ll ask Tom for you .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that .
I made him change his plan .
You should take it easy .
This was your idea .
We enjoyed watching TV .
Tom probably went swimming yesterday .
Why not look into the matter yourself ?
He is my brother , not father .
That &apos;s over .
I thought I was losing my mind .
You have to stay awake .
Tom is the chief .
Tom is like one of the family .
Nobody talked about the movie .
Tom has started studying French .
Do you have a minute ?
Tell Tom he has to do that .
When will you leave ?
Tom and I are newcomers .
Why don &apos;t you want this ?
I can explain it to you if you let me .
I don &apos;t trust you .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
I want us to be friends .
How do you know about Tom ?
I &apos;ll write to Tom .
It &apos;s next to impossible to finish it in a day .
That won &apos;t happen .
Tom and Mary are in love .
Everybody needs one .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom has already made up his mind .
Do you really want to have kids ?
What made you ask that question ?
Tom says he &apos;s always wanted to study French .
Can I get you a beer or something ?
I don &apos;t remember .
I &apos;ve got this little job I want you to do .
I understand Tom .
I can &apos;t see who Tom is talking to .
Be nice to her .
He walks to school .
Tom may not be happy .
I &apos;m not giving up .
Tell Tom that I was just joking .
How old do you think she is ?
What do you think about this ?
Tom knew he needed to leave town .
I want to talk to you about last night .
Were you looking for Tom ?
I almost feel sorry for you .
It is too good to be true .
Where would I find books ?
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t want to die today .
We often hear you sing .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t injured .
Tom was very sick .
Tom lives here alone .
You don &apos;t need to do that if you don &apos;t want to .
What &apos;re you doing out here ?
Tom isn &apos;t like you .
I &apos;m sure Tom will understand .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
You &apos;re fine .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
You wouldn &apos;t believe it .
We have until tomorrow morning .
You are very beautiful .
Tom knew about this .
There are some pretty flowers in the garden .
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
They wouldn &apos;t have done anything .
I won &apos;t dance .
Everybody is very busy .
Tom can &apos;t be too far behind us .
We sometimes see them .
Tom is quitting .
I like this music .
Tom had dinner with Mary .
Why don &apos;t you get Tom to do that ?
You don &apos;t have to answer this question .
What we &apos;re doing now is very dangerous .
Tom said he thought that Mary was in Boston .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary and she won &apos;t talk to him .
Tom ditched me .
How long will we have ?
This has been a long week .
He has decided not to go to the meeting .
The place where he lives is far from town .
I said that I didn &apos;t want to do that .
Dinner &apos;s ready .
She spoke rapidly .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his family .
Tom likes doing that here .
I was very hungry .
I just couldn &apos;t sleep .
Today , we &apos;re going dancing .
What was the problem ?
Don &apos;t tell Tom I said that .
We &apos;re going to my brother &apos;s .
He is pleased with his new car .
Tom has a guitar .
This job is too much for me .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
That &apos;s my affair .
I &apos;m not used to this .
We &apos;ll take my car .
He is short , but he is strong .
I know where Tom lives .
Tom and Mary are both my friends .
The doctor said that Tom didn &apos;t need to stay in the hospital .
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
It was hot yesterday .
Are you guys still dating ?
Tom couldn &apos;t wait to get home .
Tom looks like he &apos;s happy .
You &apos;re always welcome here , Tom .
I &apos;m happy the game is over .
Tom is leaving now .
We think that &apos;s a good thing .
She watched the children going back to school .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
She fell in love with him .
Tom can come .
He is a teacher .
I went to school there .
I want to know what &apos;s going on out here .
Please listen to me when I &apos;m speaking to you .
It &apos;s very hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
Is there space for another person ?
I &apos;ll be with you in a second .
I think maybe Tom is scared .
I think that she will not come .
Tom can change .
My father works for a bank .
We have lunch at about noon .
Tom is small for his age .
He died ten years ago .
The question is simple .
Tom is capable of doing that .
I say what I think .
Tom doesn &apos;t like going to school .
Tom came to ask us to help him .
Tom is still very young .
I crossed the street .
Tom said he was going to try to help us .
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
There &apos;s only one window in my room .
Tom &apos;s young .
I &apos;ll think about it .
I saw them .
He waited for me until I arrived .
I hear something .
I thought I was too old .
Tom had no reason not to do it .
Please be quiet .
Tom must be home by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve never met her .
I should &apos;ve told you everything earlier .
Tom left the house after breakfast .
There were a lot of people there .
He wants more .
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
Tom has work to do .
You should eat more .
What he is saying does not make sense .
Where &apos;s your money ?
Did you do that ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault .
It &apos;s your only chance .
I don &apos;t know what Tom saw .
That &apos;s more than I can handle alone .
I wish I had more time to talk with you .
Do you know what Tom wants ?
We can &apos;t turn back .
She writes beautifully .
Tom is learning .
Swimming is not allowed in this river .
Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to do that tomorrow .
I can &apos;t quit thinking about you .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
I heard you .
Tom is barely alive .
What is the matter with you ?
Tom drives .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
That wasn &apos;t bad .
That has nothing to do with you .
What does Tom really think ?
It was a nice party .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not half as glad as I am .
I want to be there with Tom .
We &apos;ve already partied all night .
Shut up and do as you &apos;re told .
I can see Tom .
Why do you want to die ?
I hear from him once a month .
Would you like to see Tom ?
There was nobody on the beach .
Tom heard that Mary was sick .
What have you been doing all this while ?
Tom can &apos;t believe how stupid Mary is .
You &apos;re not telling me the whole truth .
It &apos;ll be good to get home .
You don &apos;t have the time .
You got hurt , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m surprised you came at all .
Each of them has a bicycle .
My family isn &apos;t rich .
What did you eat for breakfast ?
I know Tom &apos;s sister .
The students did the work themselves .
This desk is good .
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
Did Tom tell you what to do ?
I &apos;m proud of you .
You have no idea where we are , do you ?
Are you sure that this isn &apos;t true ?
You &apos;re not as old as I thought you were .
I &apos;ve got nothing else to do .
I can speak English .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
That could take hours .
He took off his glasses .
Which cup is yours ?
I don &apos;t know when Tom and Mary met .
She really needs your help .
Water is important .
He found out the secret .
I &apos;m older than Tom .
He tried to sleep on the floor .
We know where it is .
Has something changed ?
I told Tom how proud I was of him .
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
They aren &apos;t happy to see Tom .
Tom says he &apos;ll do whatever we do .
I think he &apos;s correct .
How many times do I have to explain this to you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t ever come here by himself .
I feel fine .
What &apos;s the best way to get there ?
How much did you pay for that ?
Love is the answer to everything .
It won &apos;t come to that .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
You don &apos;t realize how lucky you are .
I &apos;d like to ask one or two questions myself .
I &apos;m scared .
Give me your knife .
I will give you this book .
I learned that from you .
I have seen enough .
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened ?
Tom was married to Mary .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
Our son died in the war .
I want you to be happy .
I will never have a daughter .
I care what other people think of me .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
He must be the principal .
Tom dislikes being told what to do .
I don &apos;t want meat .
They may be playing in the park .
I &apos;m not sure I want to see this .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s married to .
It just doesn &apos;t matter .
What &apos;ll you have to drink ?
Tom disappointed me .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
I can &apos;t get Tom to help me .
Tom abandoned them .
I don &apos;t want your money .
Tom knows you .
I sympathize .
Tom is trying to understand .
I wish you didn &apos;t do that .
What exactly happened there ?
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not the case .
I saw Tom on TV .
I think it &apos;s time to do my homework .
Tom is hurt .
You &apos;re not my type .
I don &apos;t do it anymore .
Tom will have an answer for you by next week .
Doing that wasn &apos;t an option .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
They &apos;re cold .
How was your weekend ?
Tom is expecting me .
You &apos;re looking tired .
What are you doing out here ?
I was walking in the park with a friend of mine when it started raining .
You ought to write a book .
People talk without having anything to say .
Aren &apos;t you hot ?
The school awarded Mary a prize .
You &apos;ll be happy .
I wish someone would help me do that .
I didn &apos;t believe Tom .
How did Tom find you ?
You &apos;re the one who knows how to do this .
Have you seen my wife ?
It is absolutely impossible .
I like your hat .
He was silly enough to believe her .
Mary looks hot .
How long do I have ?
I thought I heard music .
She talks quickly .
She ran as fast as she could .
I &apos;m at the airport now .
I think it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
Pay close attention to what I &apos;m telling you .
What was there ?
Tom was still in Boston this time last year .
Tom asked me to talk to Mary .
Everyone knows what they have to do , right ?
Tom knows this place .
Do you already have a plan ?
Is Tom serious ?
You live too far away .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of your mother .
I have to know what &apos;s going on .
How come you know so much ?
Tom couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
I drove Tom to the hospital .
Tom is playing outdoors .
He comes to see me nearly every day .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
Tom said he thought Mary was in Boston .
I &apos;m going to do it for you .
Tom showed me the letter .
You had better not speak loudly in this room .
Tom is certain to come on time .
How long have you had this problem ?
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
Tom should count his blessings .
I &apos;m never going to Boston again .
Tom worked all night .
I &apos;m not a mind reader . You need to tell me what you want .
Everything is going very well .
Tom is off duty tonight .
What should I have done ?
Tell your friends .
Tom is going to be fine .
I need to ask you some questions .
All of us plan to do that .
Tom says he was busy .
Tom makes more money than his parents .
His house is not far from here .
I don &apos;t know the way .
&quot; What &apos;s the matter with you ? &quot; she demanded .
I &apos;m older than you think .
I asked him where he was going .
I &apos;ll phone you .
Tom has told us a lot about you .
My father is a doctor .
Tom laid his bag on the table .
Tom doesn &apos;t care .
There &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
She doesn &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Let &apos;s have dinner .
Do you believe me ?
He was disappointed at not being invited .
How much did you win ?
Anything can happen on TV .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It &apos;s about a ten-minute drive from here .
Tom has got it .
Tom and Mary like each other .
Why didn &apos;t you do that ?
You can &apos;t make me love you .
I don &apos;t know any of her students .
He &apos;s in my class .
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself .
He told me a long story .
Don &apos;t leave , Tom .
I think we both know why I &apos;m here .
What &apos;s your daughter &apos;s name ?
I love this company .
I know why you want this job .
Tom made it easy for me .
Why are we running ?
Tom &apos;s office is larger than Mary &apos;s .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
He must buy a new bicycle for his son .
Tom died doing what he loved .
I have a problem with my car .
Tom is your son , not mine .
Tom helped Mary with her homework .
Tom likes to write .
Why isn &apos;t it here ?
I know him better than anybody .
What &apos;s the secret ?
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question .
How long have you been in Boston ?
They &apos;ll find her .
Tom isn &apos;t the problem .
I did it for you .
I like Tom very much .
Are you saying you don &apos;t want to go ?
What &apos;s this ?
Do you want to be my girlfriend ?
We have a long ways to go .
Where were you guys today ?
Let Tom do that .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be easy to find a place .
I don &apos;t mean you .
I have another sister .
We have to think about our children .
I know nothing about you .
You don &apos;t have to study .
The only one we have is this one here .
I have a great deal to do tonight .
He is as healthy as ever .
Tom stood behind me .
Where are your children now ?
Tom can &apos;t understand why Mary is angry .
I can &apos;t read French .
She can &apos;t afford it .
I don &apos;t like Tom and Mary .
You have to stop it .
I will always remember you .
Are you a doctor ?
They don &apos;t want you here .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
I like to walk .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed a little longer .
That &apos;s how we first met .
How did you like the party ?
Tom is on vacation in Australia .
Why are you being so kind ?
Both you and I are students .
Tom may do what he wants .
We &apos;re both from Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what Mary said .
They may come .
He became so ill that he died two hours later .
I called Tom and told him about my problem .
I don &apos;t want you doing that .
Tom and Mary both can &apos;t swim .
I &apos;m eating lunch .
Tom knows what &apos;s going on .
Tom would &apos;ve liked what you said .
You are stupid .
She is proud of her children .
What is it you like about Tom ?
Tom makes fun of everybody .
This book is very good .
My hair &apos;s too long .
Tom and Mary remind me of my parents .
Tom fell off his bicycle .
It &apos;s five o &apos;clock .
I didn &apos;t think Tom was in Boston .
Tom asked Mary to give a speech at his school .
We &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
Tom is finally going to do what he told us he &apos;d do .
Tom tried to solve the problem .
This one &apos;s my room , Tom .
Maybe that &apos;s the reason .
When did you buy it ?
I managed to repair my car by myself .
I want another beer .
My son is playing in the rain .
No one had an answer .
I never swim by myself .
Put out the light .
No one &apos;s stopping you .
Get back in the house .
I like your car .
Tom said that he thought Mary understood .
All the students are studying English .
This makes me very happy .
What do you mean by it ?
Children should drink milk every day .
I want that one .
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
Is it love ?
I didn &apos;t receive even one letter from her .
I think that I &apos;ll do that .
Where &apos;s this from ?
There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
I wouldn &apos;t be too sure if I were you .
It &apos;s not going to be long .
Tom looked very young .
I can &apos;t pay for the car .
Is it really possible ?
We need the money .
I &apos;ll visit my uncle next week .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting along .
I wonder why she didn &apos;t tell him about it .
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
Did you buy this book ?
What are you up to these days ?
Tom is coming for you .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
I hate children .
I &apos;m in Boston all this week .
I want to wait another week .
Where is the nearest bench ?
I &apos;m in the attic .
Tom is a very close friend .
Tom had one daughter .
Tom looks much better now .
Would you like some coffee ?
I am glad to help you .
It sure is cold today .
Don &apos;t be upset .
In a word , life is short .
Did Tom see this ?
Tom and Mary were married .
There is one thing I don &apos;t understand .
Tom asked Mary to explain it .
It could have been anyone .
Tom and Mary are good people .
It didn &apos;t really hurt .
I want to hear the whole story .
I wish I had listened to your advice .
They don &apos;t have a chance .
You know this is what I want .
Tom was the first .
Tom wasn &apos;t as surprised as I was .
Tom got everything he wanted .
Here &apos;s what to do .
There &apos;s a reason for it .
I can &apos;t help you with this .
I go to school because I want to learn .
It wasn &apos;t funny at all .
You &apos;ve tried .
I want to tell you something .
You may still do it if you want to .
You must go at once .
Tom will drive you home .
We need more people like you .
You &apos;ll be safe with me .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
Did you do your homework ?
Tom reads the newspaper every day .
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us .
Tom couldn &apos;t get in touch with Mary .
I need to know before 2 : 30 .
I didn &apos;t immediately understand it .
We don &apos;t have a plan .
Why are people afraid of the police ?
I have to stop .
How is life ?
These are my parents .
It is likely to rain today .
Tom wants to study music .
That &apos;s your funeral .
I wouldn &apos;t mind doing that .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
I can see why you don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom was the last to leave .
Tom has a brother in Australia .
I &apos;ll be there rain or shine .
I don &apos;t know why they did that .
I was home all night .
I bought it .
He got rich quickly .
What do you want from Tom ?
I needed to talk to you .
I got tired very fast .
Tom said goodnight .
It was your idea .
Is Tom there ?
Tom went straight home after school .
She claims that she knows nothing about him , but I don &apos;t believe her .
It &apos;s that simple .
Are those yours ?
She made tea for me .
I need to see you immediately .
Tom couldn &apos;t help .
I &apos;m getting tired .
Tom might need to help Mary .
I know too much .
It is their last movie .
I am proud to work with you .
I should never have let you do that by yourself .
May I go home ?
The mother didn &apos;t know what to do with her son .
Everybody likes them .
Can you tell me what is happening ?
I have to leave now .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was that old .
That &apos;s not what I think .
If it were not for your help , I could not succeed .
I think I lost my keys .
Tom and I are getting married .
I know you &apos;re not serious .
What &apos;s it worth ?
Tom knows I know .
The sun is in the sky .
I told you I don &apos;t know how to do that .
I have no time to read books .
Don &apos;t boast too much about that .
Tom asked Mary to help him with his homework .
We haven &apos;t had much rain this year .
Tom knew what he was doing .
That &apos;s not what you said .
I don &apos;t know your name .
Do you plan on using that ?
His bag was stolen yesterday .
Were you expecting someone ?
It is his decision .
I &apos;ve only had one boyfriend .
I met him yesterday for the first time .
I was really hungry .
He &apos;ll be along in ten minutes .
This is going to be easy .
They don &apos;t make you happy .
That is not exactly what I said .
You &apos;re not telling me anything I haven &apos;t already heard .
I &apos;d rather not eat right now .
You need friends .
She has done her homework .
Tom knows this isn &apos;t good .
I &apos;m tired of hearing that .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a good idea .
My father bought this hat for me .
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
Tom needs to make a decision .
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem .
Look at the price .
I met a student from America yesterday .
Tom will never have to worry about money .
I thought it was best not to say anything .
I am very hungry .
I expected Tom to be here .
I thought Tom would sleep until noon .
Tom gave his cat some milk .
I don &apos;t have time to help you right now .
There &apos;s something I need to talk with you about .
You ought to write a book .
Tom can speak French better than Mary .
It &apos;s bad for business .
That should make you happy .
Tom said he saw Mary yesterday .
Don &apos;t bother to come to my house .
It &apos;s too hot for me .
Where are your kids ?
She is incapable of doing anything alone .
If you want something done right , you have to do it yourself .
Are you sure you want to do that ?
I am not a teacher .
Is that even a real word ?
She has a dog and six cats .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
Do you want to play tennis with us ?
Everything must come to an end .
Our train arrived on time .
I did no such thing .
You &apos;ve been really helpful .
Does she have children ?
Why didn &apos;t you visit Boston ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom &apos;s car was stolen .
I found this watch at the station .
I think I know what to do .
What exactly do you want to do ?
Tom will know where to go .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Tom said that he wants to do everything by himself .
What are they doing ?
I am very sorry .
Everything else doesn &apos;t matter now .
Tom &apos;s apartment is small .
Could you explain it to me ?
I don &apos;t want you to see my daughter anymore .
Is that as fast as you can go ?
Tom came too late .
How have you been keeping ?
Can I work here ?
Aren &apos;t you students ?
Tom and Mary are John &apos;s children .
Tom already knows that .
Tom said he is glad that you &apos;re back .
Did Tom hurt you ?
I &apos;ll get this to Tom .
I have a decision to make .
Everybody knows I hate Tom .
I went to bed a little later than usual .
What did you buy your boyfriend ?
It will only hurt a little .
Maybe what you said about Tom is right .
You were absent from school yesterday .
I don &apos;t understand you .
Here &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
What has the world come to ?
Tom fell from the tree .
Here is your key .
Do you know how Tom does that ?
Tom put his hand on Mary &apos;s .
Nobody wants you to do that .
She will care for you from now on .
I &apos;m going to buy some bread .
I saw Tom do it .
We can &apos;t do it .
I really want to know .
I believe in him .
This is Tom &apos;s computer .
He made a bad decision .
When is school over ?
How did you learn that Tom was living in Boston ?
What makes you think Tom is here ?
I was at the library .
Nobody wants to talk about that .
Somebody &apos;s coming .
Tom looks lost .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
We &apos;ve been studying French for three years .
I can &apos;t believe that .
Tom is coming with us to Boston .
You must do as I say .
Tom might be able to help you .
That &apos;s my dad .
I didn &apos;t think it mattered .
They don &apos;t have to know .
Asked if he was happy , Tom said that he was .
Tom already has plans for Monday .
I can see the light .
Tom is a friend .
Tom said it was your fault .
I go for a walk every morning .
He never saw his mother again .
I &apos;ve only seen Tom once .
This isn &apos;t for Tom .
Why did you help me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
I can eat anything .
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
You can &apos;t dance , can you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t believe Mary at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t want this .
We don &apos;t know what Tom said .
Tom wants to keep things the way they are .
Do you want one of them ?
You have to begin as soon as possible .
I thought you were right .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time right now to do that .
I did what I could . It &apos;s your turn now .
Do you know where Tom is ?
You don &apos;t look sick to me .
What will become of the children now that both parents are dead ?
Is there any other way I can pay you ?
It runs in the family .
Tom asked why .
They don &apos;t want you .
I will never do it again .
The time has come .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s dad .
I had to go to work .
They &apos;re back .
I didn &apos;t tell them .
What about you ?
He left three days ago .
Tom has decided against doing that .
What has become of him ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in days .
I don &apos;t know what I want .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
I never want to see your face again .
Isn &apos;t that a boy &apos;s name ?
Tom made Mary one of these , too .
You should try to learn a little French .
Great weather , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom appears to be a bit nervous .
I &apos;m pleased to finally meet you .
I wasn &apos;t talking about you .
Tom was distracted .
I have never read that book .
What made Tom do that ?
Why do you like Boston ?
We study music .
My mother worries about everything .
It must be pretty cold .
He resembles his grandfather .
Why did you write this book ?
Who lives in that house ?
They can understand me .
Are you in love ?
There is no answer to your question .
Tom lost his parents when he was young .
Don &apos;t let him do it alone .
It &apos;s right over here .
The question is who &apos;ll do it .
Tom bought a newspaper .
I oppose it .
Tom knew it was impossible .
I don &apos;t need your money . What I need is your time .
Tom looks fine .
We do need your advice .
Tom had to stay in the hospital .
Did you call me ?
There &apos;s something else you need to do .
We &apos;re going to wait in the car .
Tom has a daughter who &apos;s very beautiful .
I would &apos;ve done anything .
Why not go to Boston ?
I told Tom what you did .
I haven &apos;t finished speaking yet .
Many of the students were tired .
Everything is in place now .
Time is on their side .
This is not funny anymore .
Your mother will be back before long .
I wasn &apos;t afraid .
Maybe we just weren &apos;t meant to be together .
Tom has arrived .
Tom married Mary &apos;s sister and Mary married Tom &apos;s brother .
You gave Tom the money he asked for , didn &apos;t you ?
You need to stop .
I can &apos;t believe that you like that restaurant .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
It is no use worrying about it .
Why are they saying that ?
What do you want to learn ?
I came with my friends .
What do you want ?
I &apos;m quite satisfied .
Somebody needs to be here for the children .
Something happened .
It &apos;s always a pleasure to talk with Tom .
I &apos;m going to give it to you .
People Tom &apos;s age don &apos;t make new friends easily .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
You can &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
I talked to my friends about it .
Are you really a doctor ?
That isn &apos;t it .
I have a lot of money .
I don &apos;t get you .
Listen very closely .
We should go this way .
How does Tom make money ?
He has gone too far .
We are here .
I think you should sit .
I saw you with a tall boy .
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;ll give you whatever you want .
I go to school every day .
I have your dog with me .
You &apos;re one of us now .
Tom should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
Is it something serious ?
I &apos;m a little tired .
Maybe you didn &apos;t understand me .
Can you read that ?
Is Tom delirious ?
I &apos;m against it .
Tom ran .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom asked me for money .
Bless you .
Tom says he &apos;s happy .
That &apos;s what I thought you said .
They &apos;re afraid of me .
I &apos;m not thinking about it .
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened .
Tom had a cat .
Tom seldom wears a hat .
All you had to do was ask .
I saw it on TV .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know about Mary &apos;s death yet .
Tom will work .
How can you say something like that ?
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t have enough money on me at this time .
The price is good .
Tom and Mary are both thirty .
You shouldn &apos;t go to school .
What do you mean by it ?
That is our school .
I couldn &apos;t hear Tom .
Tom called back .
Did Tom call you ?
You must do as I say .
Tom is one of my best friends .
You know it doesn &apos;t matter .
You &apos;ve lost everything .
He asked me for money .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what to do .
Why would you want to do something like that ?
It happened to me about a year ago .
Did you understand what he said ?
You &apos;d better do that now .
We have arrived .
Tom died a few weeks ago .
Where do you work ?
I &apos;m going to show you something .
I can &apos;t figure out what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
Tom may come here .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
Tom will get married next month .
Tell Tom to be quiet .
We have had little snow this winter .
I wish I could be there with you .
I don &apos;t have time to explain it now .
Tom wants a new car .
Tom seemed hurt .
I always enjoy hearing you sing .
You came too late .
Tom is going to be sorry .
I remember both of you .
Tom won &apos;t speak to Mary .
This building belongs to my family .
Tom can &apos;t swim at all .
She could not find her way back .
I &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
It &apos;s getting hot .
I saw Tom again last night .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did that .
I have some homework to finish .
His son is eight years old .
I haven &apos;t got all day .
I think you know why I &apos;m here .
What did you do then ?
What do you want with Tom ?
Tom bought a present for his son .
Mary likes watching TV .
I &apos;m glad Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Where did Tom see you ?
I forget her name .
What are they looking for ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary .
Have you read it ?
Why are you talking like that ?
I can &apos;t let you leave .
Thanks for talking to me .
Nobody was listening to the speech .
We were both a little drunk .
I wonder why everybody left so early .
Here is your bag .
What is it that you want ?
Tom might hear you .
She is angry with me .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
Will you buy me some bread , please ?
Did you ask Tom why he wasn &apos;t at the meeting ?
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
You &apos;re sick !
Nobody cares what you think .
I &apos;d like to say something .
I hope to hear from you .
Tom probably won &apos;t come .
Tom is very disappointed in Mary .
I will join you .
I don &apos;t like to drive .
Tom seemed ready .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
I have to do this alone .
She never told me .
Can you handle it ?
She has been sick for a week .
I think it &apos;s time for us to leave .
Would you like to drink anything ?
Are they gone ?
Could you please take me back home ?
He stood in front of me .
How can you tell ?
Tom never thinks about others .
I like them all .
We &apos;re going alone .
I did everything for you .
Let me do that for you .
She told her son to wait a minute .
We need a car .
What is in the desk ?
I &apos;m glad I was able to help you last week .
Those who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t need to go .
We went on foot .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s true or not .
Tom hasn &apos;t done anything .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to bed so late yesterday .
She used to play tennis with him .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
We should not have done that . It was wrong .
That &apos;s what Tom said to Mary .
You never asked me .
I know .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk about work .
Here &apos;s some more tea .
How did you know my name ?
This is Tom .
He is watching TV .
We were both hungry .
I like doing that as well .
Can you do this ?
I have not had anything to eat since this morning .
Tom can &apos;t come with us .
Tom has a lot of things to do .
I feel very sick .
I &apos;ll be your teacher .
I don &apos;t want to play with Tom .
Is this a river ?
Maybe Tom should study French .
You look very good .
What did Tom have to do with it ?
Tom sat down on the couch beside Mary .
I don &apos;t think Tom needs our help .
Tom &apos;s not coming , because I don &apos;t want him to .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
My son is not old enough for school .
I understand what you mean .
How did that work ?
You stole the money , didn &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re not my friend anymore .
When are you busy ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened because he wasn &apos;t there .
I &apos;ll try .
This book isn &apos;t as easy as that one .
They say he &apos;s sick .
I think Tom likes Mary .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever wait for anyone .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure .
Tom told Mary that he was hungry .
Tom is still there .
I don &apos;t feel like studying .
Tom is our son .
Who &apos;ll cook ?
I don &apos;t like doing that when it &apos;s raining .
Tom might come .
Are those guys from your school ?
I won !
I &apos;ll be back at six .
We &apos;ll be living here next month .
I have seen her before .
How many books do you think you &apos;ve read so far ?
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
Tom is quite good at his job .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough friends .
It takes time .
Do you have this in a bigger size ?
I feel so cold .
Tom put a cup of coffee down in front of Mary .
I am not a doctor .
Can we help you ?
He wished she had more time for him .
We can get what we want without your help .
I told Tom I &apos;m from Boston .
This house belongs to Tom .
We know all about you .
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ?
That isn &apos;t the case in Japan .
What makes you think that ?
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I had no choice . &quot;
I &apos;m a child .
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know what he did .
Are you happy with your new car ?
I really liked your story .
It was lucky Tom did that .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
Tom and Mary never do anything together anymore .
My clock is five minutes fast .
What &apos;re you going to do ?
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon ?
He doesn &apos;t have a computer .
We can &apos;t see it .
Make it a little bigger .
It seems that he &apos;s happy .
He knows the city well .
Who &apos;s that with Tom ?
Let me tell you a little about myself .
You remind me of my son .
She came home in low spirits .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
Tom asked Mary not to text him again .
I don &apos;t like this movie .
I remember everything you tell me .
He can &apos;t buy himself a car .
You &apos;d better consult your doctor .
We should let him know .
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be very happy together .
I &apos;d never ever do that .
I don &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
I don &apos;t want to get married .
I want to study abroad .
I need to talk with Tom .
We barely had time to do everything that had to be done .
I &apos;d like to go , too .
Tom loves Australia .
I didn &apos;t know you had a cat .
I wonder how Tom does that .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
Tom looked busy .
We should be there by noon .
What do you want to do with it ?
Why are they here ?
Are you mad at me ?
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
I didn &apos;t read the book .
I &apos;m not that old .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
Should I wait for you here ?
How do you think Tom is doing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can swim or not .
There were three men in the room .
I just find it hard to believe that Tom really believes that .
I don &apos;t want you to be here .
Tom is doing very well .
These books are my books .
I remember reading that book .
That man &apos;s helped my family a lot .
It &apos;s not going to be like that .
Who was it that did that yesterday ?
It would be fun .
Don &apos;t talk !
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
It is foolish of you to say such a thing .
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to Boston without you .
I don &apos;t know how to do anything else .
Tom did it for me .
Take your time .
Are you from the United States ?
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with you .
It wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s idea . It was mine .
I believe it &apos;s finished .
Tom is in love with me .
Tom &apos;s up .
I received your message yesterday .
Where did you buy the flowers ?
Finish your work .
Who wrote the book ?
The answer is anything but simple .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that .
Tom is learning French .
Do you know how to dance ?
There are many flowers in the garden .
I don &apos;t feel like dancing .
Tom seemed to enjoy it .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to go to school today .
May I begin ?
All we need is water .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
He always takes his time in everything he does .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
I &apos;m not good at this sort of thing .
In the summer , it is very hot here .
We went to Boston last month to visit Tom .
I &apos;ll be done in five minutes .
How many days do you think it &apos;ll take to do that ?
We can &apos;t have you working for us .
I don &apos;t understand Tom .
Are they all the same ?
It won &apos;t be easy .
Is that your house ?
I can &apos;t do anything for Tom .
We don &apos;t know him .
What if he doesn &apos;t want to talk to me ?
He asked me for help .
They &apos;re happy .
You may still do it if you want to .
Stop doing that .
I was alone in the classroom .
Tom is going to tell Mary he &apos;s sorry .
It &apos;s very interesting .
Tom said he left his keys at home .
Are you happy with your new job ?
I &apos;ve been looking for a girl like you .
I still don &apos;t know yet .
He is playing music .
Tom will take care of everything .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Who bought you this dress ?
I &apos;m here because of Tom .
Did you do your homework by yourself ?
I almost wish I could be in your shoes .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he needs .
He started a new life .
I &apos;ll take that one , too .
I can &apos;t read yet .
Why are you acting like you don &apos;t know me ?
Can you please stop that ?
She is not as old as my sister is .
He also speaks French .
I went to the hospital .
It is dangerous to drive so fast .
Tom helped us .
I want one , but not this one .
Isn &apos;t it about time to go home ?
Tom looked sick .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
You &apos;re no longer children .
You can do better than this .
Tom takes himself too seriously .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy a new bicycle .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
I knew I forgot something .
Are you interested ?
Where do you go to school ?
I was at a movie theater .
I asked Tom if he knew Mary .
I &apos;ve got to make lunch .
I can carry that for you if you &apos;d like me to .
Here &apos;s the answer to your question .
Boys are not welcome .
You are doing very well . Keep it up .
Can I sit with you ?
Tom should &apos;ve worked harder .
Tom took off running .
I have nothing further to say .
I don &apos;t know much about Boston .
I finally found out what happened .
How could that happen ?
How many cats are there in this house ?
He often writes to his parents in Japan .
There is one thing I want to ask .
Tom might know .
Tom is mad at Mary .
Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
Tom never made it back home last night .
She is likely to come .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
You &apos;re very good-looking .
I was angry because he was late .
Mary really takes after her mother .
You let me down .
Everyone &apos;s sick .
Are you ready to eat ?
This is my bike .
Can I get something to eat ?
If anything happens , let me know .
Tom is very quiet .
These are yours .
Tom speaks French as well as Mary .
I don &apos;t know where to begin .
He &apos;s my first love .
Why aren &apos;t you at home ?
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom looked nervously at the doctor .
You know we love you .
I know who she is .
She adores cats .
Let Tom do anything he wants .
I don &apos;t eat fish .
Tom was such a good kid .
That suitcase isn &apos;t theirs .
Don &apos;t get so excited !
You have what it takes .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
I said yes .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s family .
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
I have to go do this .
Tom has been in prison since October .
You shouldn &apos;t eat here .
Tom &apos;s restaurant is full all the time .
Tom doesn &apos;t make many mistakes .
We were both very hungry .
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
Tom was so careful .
Tom is calm and patient .
Can I see that ?
I have seen him once .
It &apos;s free .
You know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m busy here .
I had nothing to do with that .
Tom and Mary have just left .
Tom didn &apos;t answer the phone .
I made that .
Mary is young and beautiful .
Do you have any idea where Tom might be waiting ?
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
My family is in Boston .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom understands Mary .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
We are a family .
I &apos;ll go on my own .
What did you wear ?
Did you get her letter ?
It &apos;ll definitely rain .
Tom stayed there for three days .
We &apos;re working on this issue .
I don &apos;t mind walking in the rain .
Tom put his bag under the table .
Tom loves coffee .
This came for you .
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
You &apos;ve done it !
When was it you first met Tom ?
He said he would come .
You &apos;re wounded .
Did Tom give you something for me ?
She is not afraid of anything .
Tom is still in love with you .
This door won &apos;t open .
Can I speak to Tom ?
Tom only sleeps about five hours a night .
Please raise your hand before you speak .
I have a lot of books .
Tom looks hurt .
I know what &apos;s good for you .
You can &apos;t both be right .
We can rely on Tom .
I would like to hear your opinion .
I &apos;m old , but I &apos;m not that old .
I &apos;m going to see Mary this afternoon .
Have you had dinner already ?
They &apos;re rich .
It wasn &apos;t difficult to understand .
Tom was just about to say something when Mary walked into the room .
Tom is the one you want .
My phone is about to die .
Tom and Mary must love each other very much .
Tom can &apos;t speak French well .
Don &apos;t be late for school again .
I thought I &apos;d left it at home .
Tom wants this .
It is said that he is sick .
I answered the door .
There are a few books in the bag .
I was scared .
He started to sing .
He has been working all day long .
Why is it upside down ?
Tom wants to study French .
I had a feeling you were going to say that .
Is there a bank near here ?
What do you have for breakfast ?
I thought you &apos;d understand .
We saw it .
What was the weather like yesterday ?
It &apos;s the best house in town .
Tom ran out of the house .
She sometimes takes a walk in the park .
Is Tom a teacher ?
I can &apos;t carry this suitcase by myself .
I want to apologize .
I &apos;ve got a lot to do .
We &apos;re in trouble .
I suppose you want to eat now .
We &apos;re not going to do it .
I punched him in the face .
This is the hotel where we stayed last year .
I &apos;m not good with names .
What should I do ?
Tom is bragging about his new car .
Tom and Mary were lucky kids .
I &apos;ll do it with you .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
The sun is shining in my face .
I &apos;ll wait for you .
Tom is able to speak French .
You should eat .
I don &apos;t have my glasses with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents .
Where can we meet you ?
You &apos;d better consult the doctor .
I was expecting you last night .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s teacher is .
It is difficult for him to solve the problem .
You &apos;re not bad at this .
I &apos;m ready for anything .
Tom will work hard .
Who else is gone today ?
Are you saying you don &apos;t like it ?
I want to buy a new bicycle .
He began singing .
Aren &apos;t you going to finish your dinner ?
I hate French .
You have to start doing that .
You had better not speak loudly in this room .
Why is she doing this ?
I don &apos;t have to go to the doctor any more . I &apos;m feeling much better .
I &apos;m afraid he is ill .
Why would Tom leave ?
I think you &apos;d like it there .
&quot; Where would you like to work ? &quot; &quot; In Australia . &quot;
Why do you think animals dread fire ?
Is that all Tom told you ?
She goes to school .
I gave it to Tom .
You must eat .
What do they think ?
Can you hear me , Tom ?
I &apos;m not leaving until tomorrow .
I want you to go to the doctor .
Tom didn &apos;t succeed .
&quot; Look , &quot; she said .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
She wrote one letter .
Where &apos;s Tom today ?
We aren &apos;t kids anymore .
Have you eaten supper yet ?
Tom is not going to do it .
I had fun with it .
I wish he were here .
Tom wanted to go with Mary .
His birthday falls on Sunday .
I want to show you something in my office .
That won &apos;t change anything .
She is like a hen with one chicken .
I gave him all the money I had .
She is always busy .
Tell us who you are .
I think it &apos;s upside down .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to go .
Everyone seems to be busy but me .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me .
Tom has never been so happy .
Tom wants to be like his father .
She asked him how to get to the station .
I &apos;ve been driving this car for three years .
I knew you &apos;d get it .
Do you still have family in Boston ?
My father abandoned me when I was young .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
Why didn &apos;t you think of that before ?
Do you want to be rich ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know who Mary is .
Our teacher speaks French as well as English .
How is your father ?
I said there was nothing we could do .
Tom might have to study French .
Do you want to buy a shirt ?
I went to bed early .
Tom could see Mary .
I never said it was going to be easy .
It &apos;s your move .
Can you stay a bit longer ?
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
That &apos;s what I thought , too .
How many eggs were you able to get yesterday ?
Women are beautiful .
Who was invited to the party ?
Tom ran after Mary .
I think Tom is here already .
I don &apos;t love her , not even if she loves me .
We &apos;re all hungry .
I should &apos;ve talked to Tom first .
Where were you on your birthday ?
What &apos;ve you got for me ?
I should &apos;ve kept my mouth shut .
I don &apos;t remember when I first met him .
Did you go to school today ?
I started reading the book .
Did you come here to help me or not ?
I want to go to the park .
No one knows his name .
I have nothing to do with this matter .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
I sat next to him .
Can &apos;t you do it ?
I &apos;m also a teacher .
I don &apos;t like that woman .
I suppose you think Tom is really stupid .
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
He is no longer a boy .
I can give it a try .
I found this under your bed .
I don &apos;t mind sleeping on the couch .
She always boasts of her luck .
Tom and only Tom knows the whole truth .
I think Tom would like that .
That can &apos;t happen .
Here &apos;s your desk .
Do you have a girlfriend ?
Tom was eating dinner when Mary arrived .
Tom knows I &apos;m here .
He lives all by himself in the country .
Is it possible that it &apos;s already eight o &apos;clock ?
I &apos;ll go by taxi .
I know your type .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I don &apos;t know whether to go to the party or not .
I think Tom was born in Australia .
You &apos;re my friend .
I can &apos;t agree with you on this matter .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth it .
Tom is making me do this .
It &apos;s not here .
I think this is yours .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary , but I like her .
That isn &apos;t enough .
Tom realized Mary was serious .
Can you speak French ?
She seems to have been ill .
She was slightly better yesterday .
I never felt like doing that .
How long is this ?
The question is whether he &apos;ll read the letter or not .
Where is the ship now ?
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
Why did you come home so late ?
Let us go .
What is Tom doing here ?
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I &apos;m going to do it again .
Tom is good-looking , isn &apos;t he ?
I really should be getting home .
You let me down .
I went to school with Tom .
That is your book .
Be careful .
That &apos;s not what I mean .
Let &apos;s go to the beach .
Your hair is too long .
This is the only thing I care about .
No one &apos;s seen Tom .
He was young .
What is the story ?
Tom didn &apos;t know who to give it to .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to think .
We understand each other .
I like your room .
Tom works here .
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died .
Tom went abroad to study French .
Who am I talking to ?
Who knows what you saw ?
Tom isn &apos;t where he wants to be .
Do you want me to do it ?
Tom , I &apos;m happy for you .
The clock is fast .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
Who brought Tom ?
Children need love .
I &apos;m not going with you .
When you &apos;ve finished reading that book , I &apos;d like to read it .
I &apos;ve been gone three weeks .
Is that possible ?
Tom has no money .
What do you think I want ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know how to boil water .
Tom is somewhere here in the park .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
Do you want to take one ?
Tom wasn &apos;t the only one who had a key .
Tom thinks Mary isn &apos;t here .
I found it easy to solve the problem .
I wish none of this had ever happened .
I &apos;d like to go home early today .
He will come .
Tom looked ready .
Where is Tom ?
I &apos;m sure that Tom won &apos;t mind .
Let &apos;s start !
She spends as much money as she earns .
This is your dog .
How do they look ?
Tom will never stop loving Mary .
I like Tom .
We &apos;re doing what we love to do .
Tom and Mary are waiting for the bus .
I have what I want .
I like to walk .
We aren &apos;t where we are supposed to be .
You &apos;ve done it !
I want to help if I can .
I believe I am in the right .
Tom looked as if he hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
I hope you &apos;ll soon get well .
Why aren &apos;t they worried ?
Tom saw Mary .
I have to tell you the truth .
There is more .
Are you as tired as I am ?
Tom waited for Mary , but she didn &apos;t come .
Tom looked hurt .
I will give it to you .
The boy made fun of the girl .
They &apos;re always careful .
You still have to pay for it .
Tom asked Mary when the last time she had bought a book was .
It &apos;s going to rain .
I came here to tell you that I found Tom .
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday .
School &apos;s not fun .
My father died five years ago .
Why are you still up ? You should get to bed .
It &apos;s too late .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t worry .
I had trouble understanding what Tom was trying to say .
I didn &apos;t want to spend any more time in bed .
Not knowing what to do , I telephoned the police .
I have things to do .
I would do anything for you .
Did you find the book you were looking for ?
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible .
They won .
I like to eat .
My wife thinks I &apos;m crazy .
Don &apos;t go home .
We did the best we could .
Everything is fine .
I met his sister last week .
There is no need to be frightened . He won &apos;t harm you .
I don &apos;t care for flowers very much .
Tom waited for more than an hour .
I have nothing else to do .
Why don &apos;t you come over after school today ?
They should ask Tom first .
Smoking is bad for you .
There are too many people in the park .
You should wait for Tom .
Can the matter wait till tomorrow ?
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
Tom has to be careful about what he eats .
I &apos;m glad of that .
I shouldn &apos;t drink .
We &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
It &apos;s all in the report .
I know where to find water .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom is as tall as I am .
It doesn &apos;t work .
You look busy .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to eat anything .
His bike is better than mine .
Tom is the new boss .
I only wish it were that simple .
I knew it .
Where &apos;s my money ?
You want it , don &apos;t you ?
Tom writes better than I do .
There &apos;s a restaurant here .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to Tom &apos;s ?
What are you doing right now ?
I didn &apos;t have a chance .
What &apos;s Tom after ?
I don &apos;t have time for this .
I know that Mary loves me .
What shall we do ?
I won &apos;t come .
Take only one .
I saw something .
You &apos;ll do what you have to do .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
What time will you get to the station ?
It is too expensive for me to buy .
I hate those .
I &apos;m afraid for his life .
No one knows the reason .
We will visit them soon .
They invited me to the party .
Is this your opinion ?
It is likely to rain soon .
I was expecting it !
When do we want it ?
I feel like drinking a beer .
Tom &apos;s response was immediate .
Tom tried to open the window .
We have all the time in the world .
Did you understand Tom ?
We can talk .
Tom deserves to know the truth .
I never actually wanted to do that .
I never should &apos;ve listened to you .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary could swim .
I gave Tom my word .
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him .
He stuck to his promise .
Mary helped Tom .
Tom was in Boston last weekend .
You &apos;d like Tom .
How big is your school ?
Tom is going to take care of Mary &apos;s dog while she &apos;s on vacation .
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend .
I was a little nervous .
Are you sure Tom is here ?
I didn &apos;t mean that to happen .
Why didn &apos;t I think of it myself ?
I love your name .
Where did you go to school ?
What are you still doing here ?
When was the last time you saw her ?
I already told you that she isn &apos;t here .
I need to talk to you about what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow .
Tom would be my first choice .
What are you going to do next Sunday ?
I think Tom likes you .
We &apos;re not welcome .
Please come here .
I &apos;m going to need you later .
I have a son not much older than you .
I know what it &apos;s like to be alone .
Where did you learn French ?
Tom writes to me every week .
I &apos;m not saying his music is bad .
We have one for you , too .
I have to be there .
Do you have any apples ?
They can &apos;t see you .
I didn &apos;t have to do anything .
I wanted them to win .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make a mistake again .
What made you ask me that ?
Should I take the bus ?
I &apos;m not dead .
It &apos;s not worth the pain .
Why am I doing this ?
We love this .
I wonder why Tom is tired .
Tom hardly ever works anymore .
Do we even have a choice ?
I cannot understand it .
I wanted to know what happened .
Are you sure that you want to do this ?
I am happy to meet you .
I &apos;ll look after you .
I met him at the station .
I want something else .
She showed me her room .
We &apos;re going to do that .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
Tom has been gone for a long time .
Let Tom buy what he wants .
He waited for him until 10 .
I know you know this .
Are you drunk ?
Smoking in bed is dangerous .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to help Mary ?
He can no longer wait .
I want you to meet my friend , Tom .
That &apos;s not what I said .
I want to eat something .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
Where is he ?
Tom worked through the night .
I want us to be a family .
You should always keep your room clean .
Tom will do it .
Is your mom at home ?
We &apos;ve been here for a couple of minutes .
I think one of these is Tom &apos;s .
I think we &apos;ve seen enough .
You &apos;re here .
Tom needs to help Mary more than he does .
She did it for her children .
Copy this , please .
I don &apos;t hate you anymore .
You should &apos;ve gone home already .
I can &apos;t imagine living a life without books .
I can &apos;t do this either .
That could be a problem .
This coffee is not hot enough .
We were both drunk .
This is good meat .
I didn &apos;t go to Boston last weekend .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
Maybe they &apos;re busy .
What time does the next train leave ?
Tom &apos;s coming .
What &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
I want another beer .
Tom took his time .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom is a little older than the rest of the students in his class .
Tom and Mary used to go out together .
Do you want to come ?
Tom is a little taller than you are .
Why didn &apos;t you think of that before ?
He &apos;s very fond of walking .
I &apos;m no good for you .
I have to talk to Tom now .
You think I don &apos;t know who you are , don &apos;t you ?
What &apos;s Tom doing with that ?
He said that you had better go .
I have Monday off .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s in love with John .
If Tom had seen anything , he would have told us .
My mother can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
We found one .
Today was better than I thought it would be .
Can I use your phone ?
Tom gets it .
May I do it right now ?
You have no idea where we are , do you ?
Tom is just trying to scare you .
How was your trip ?
Why do you say things like that ?
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
He checked in at a good hotel .
Our restaurant is the best .
I heard that Tom does that .
Why did you tell Tom Mary didn &apos;t like him ?
No one will believe him .
No one believes what Tom says anymore .
Without air we would die .
My father has just come home .
Tom was dead .
I really like you .
Tom was drunk and angry .
How is the weather in Boston ?
Where did you hear that story ?
I could hear everything .
The train is arriving soon .
Tom gave me several books .
You have to see this .
No one knows the answer .
Where do you get your hair done ?
I didn &apos;t understand anything , either .
There was no one in the room besides Tom and Mary .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know what happened .
My mother knows Tom &apos;s mother .
I think you look like Tom .
I &apos;m anxious to meet her .
Tom pretended to be dead .
You really should talk to Tom .
I was expecting you last night .
I haven &apos;t got much money with me .
Tom thinks this is a mistake .
Tom says Mary likes you .
Why isn &apos;t Tom sleeping ?
Tom isn &apos;t good-looking .
Who do you think I am ?
I am disgusted with him .
How do you like living on your own ?
I &apos;m doing what I need to do .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom in private for a moment .
Tom wasn &apos;t OK .
Tom got paid .
Tom doesn &apos;t even understand it himself .
I can &apos;t talk about this right now .
We have been studying French for three years .
Tom told me he had studied French for three years .
You &apos;ll have to come with us .
Tom was afraid of what people would think .
Do you know where Tom was born ?
Are you interested in the job ?
Tom looks tired this morning .
I &apos;ve seen that , too .
She rarely stays home on Sunday .
He was badly wounded .
I thought he was sick .
What do you like most about Boston ?
Let &apos;s see what happens .
She made me a cake .
I think I &apos;d better stay here .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
Tom and Mary have only been married three weeks .
I wrote it for Tom .
The room has two windows .
Thank you for giving this to me .
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
&quot; Where is my book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s in the classroom . &quot;
Can I take your word for it ?
No one wants that to happen .
We &apos;re not married .
I gave Tom one of those .
Do you know this ?
My shoes are too small . I need new ones .
When will it be convenient for you ?
I &apos;ve been here for an hour .
Tom said that he feels good .
They don &apos;t want it .
I &apos;ll be back at 6 : 30 .
Mary used to be beautiful .
Tom had other things he needed to do .
My car was stolen last night .
I &apos;ll ask him how the accident happened .
Those are Tom &apos;s .
I need Tom &apos;s help .
Let &apos;s talk about your job .
Tom looked very tired .
Tom is very busy .
This is my cat .
I never thought anything of it .
I may be able to help you .
I wonder why Tom did that .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t go to the movies very often .
I &apos;m not happy about that .
Tom thinks he &apos;s too good for us .
Tom is never at home .
Tom looks cold .
I know that you &apos;re disappointed .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
How long have you been dating ?
I fear so .
You &apos;re not very good at it , are you ?
I think you should give Tom a chance .
Is this book yours ?
You can &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
This is the book I want to read .
I will wait .
There &apos;s a little bit of water in the glass .
Tom is the one with the problem , not me .
How do you view this matter ?
Do you want any of these flowers ?
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
The car looked as good as new .
I &apos;ll explain it to you later on .
I &apos;m serious .
What are your plans for tonight ?
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom , how &apos;s it going ?
Tom will leave soon .
I can see some people walking across the street .
Tom is thinking about the problem .
I still don &apos;t know how to do this .
Mary looks like her mother .
Who helps her ?
Tom &apos;s afraid .
He stopped reading a book .
He was satisfied with his new car .
I didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that .
Tom never goes anywhere by himself .
Tom didn &apos;t need to tell Mary . She already knew .
You should start as early as possible .
Tom may do that for you .
I love old books .
He could still be alive somewhere .
We &apos;re different .
Tom and Mary got married three days ago .
Did you really say that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his father .
Everybody &apos;s tired .
I &apos;m very rich .
You &apos;d love it .
Tom is happy to be home .
They &apos;re all going to prison .
Tom called me .
Can I eat ?
Did you speak to Tom yesterday ?
A lot has happened while you &apos;ve been gone .
It &apos;s for Tom .
Tom is outside playing with his friends .
I saw you .
Won &apos;t you sing ?
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t the only one who hated doing that .
Don &apos;t say such a thing .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
What did Tom find ?
I want you to leave now .
I wasn &apos;t at home then .
Is this too big ?
I can tell this has been difficult for you .
Tom isn &apos;t well today .
Is it OK to do that here ?
I &apos;ll be with Tom on Monday .
She quickly opened the letter .
Tom thought it was easy .
I hope you will be pleased with this present .
Let Tom live .
Did you forget something ?
Is Tom in the hospital ?
I like this room .
Tom had an accident at work .
It happened in a flash .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary wants to go .
She is used to living alone .
It &apos;s important .
I don &apos;t like your boss .
That room is not very large .
I found the story interesting .
He &apos;s afraid of cats .
I wrote him to ask why .
The time will come when you will understand this .
She writes to me once a month .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to have anything to do with me .
Mary was beautiful .
It was nice of you to ask .
Boston is where I want to be .
Tom , this is Mary &apos;s brother John .
I love you , Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has enough money to buy that .
When was the last time you won a prize ?
Tom hasn &apos;t done any work .
He himself did it .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop doing that .
We &apos;ve got time .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary well enough to ask her to do that .
French is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom has learned a lot about Australia from Mary .
I have a brother .
You can &apos;t just go .
I saw a plane .
Is this your first time here ?
I wish things had happened differently .
This is not a hospital .
What &apos;s good ?
Tom just got home from work .
I was up all night .
You should probably tell Tom you don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom never said anything about where he &apos;d been .
She did come , but didn &apos;t stay long .
She was alone in the house .
You can &apos;t have understood what he said .
Where &apos;s Tom going to live ?
His wife was mad .
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
I &apos;m the same age as Tom .
Tom lived in Boston for a long time .
Why did you decide to study French ?
It &apos;ll be fine .
We can &apos;t afford to make any mistakes .
Is this your first trip abroad ?
This isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
She doesn &apos;t speak English .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
Those are their books .
I don &apos;t recognize any of these men .
Are you free tomorrow ?
Tom says that he &apos;s still hungry .
Could you call me tonight , please ?
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
I love French .
Tom is acting like nothing happened .
Tom likes French and he &apos;s good at it .
Give me that one .
I understand your language .
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for directions .
We don &apos;t live in Boston .
Don &apos;t bother seeing me to the door .
What do we know ?
He said he would write to me , but he hasn &apos;t .
Tom isn &apos;t as rich as his friends think he is .
Tom didn &apos;t know for certain when Mary was going to arrive .
I don &apos;t know who wrote this letter .
Tom ate my lunch .
Tom stayed up late last night .
You can &apos;t let Tom go outside .
What do you need ?
What do you like about Tom ?
Tom came into the room .
You may go .
There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
What has Tom done now ?
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been sick .
I may do that .
I heard it .
The truth is very simple .
I &apos;m so proud of Tom .
Here &apos;s something I want you to give to Tom .
You seem to know everyone here .
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is .
You &apos;ve done that already .
Air is to man what water is to fish .
This is insane .
I stayed with my uncle .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you doing that .
When he came , I was writing a letter .
I take it for granted that they &apos;ll get married .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
This task is too much for him .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
If you don &apos;t want to do it for Tom , then do it for me .
I &apos;d like to be as rich as Tom .
My work is very important .
How about you ?
Tom is very busy right now .
Do Tom and Mary know why you &apos;re here ?
I wish I had been there with you .
They &apos;re not here .
Tom gets home almost every day at 2 : 30 .
I have to go to the airport to meet my family .
Tom called Mary up from the airport .
Tom asked Mary what she wanted for her birthday .
I need a lot of them .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
I &apos;ll pay you .
I would like to come and see you .
I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
The old man lives alone .
Leave it where you found it .
Are you sure that this isn &apos;t true ?
We saw her dance .
This isn &apos;t the only key .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
I love cooking for you .
Does Tom have one ?
That &apos;s not for Tom .
Tom is exactly like his father .
Here &apos;s one for you .
I saw you there .
We want to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come .
Who invited you to the party ?
I completely forgot about that .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s not too much .
You should arrive at school before eight .
What do you think of my new hat ?
I visited my friend Tom yesterday .
What else do you know about Tom ?
I came with Tom .
How much money does he have ?
It doesn &apos;t hurt .
Tom is willing to do that for you .
Did Tom give it to you ?
I think I understood .
Tom can &apos;t handle this anymore .
Tom and Mary are doing their homework .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom is .
Have you decided to go to Australia ?
Who did you talk to ?
I &apos;ll never change my mind .
He was angry with his daughter .
Tom dated Mary for three years .
I have to get back to work .
I have no idea what this is .
She invited me to her home .
Are you all alone ?
I &apos;ve been looking for this for a long time .
I &apos;ll tell Tom .
I know almost nothing about it .
Tom will be able to do that .
Tom made himself a cup of tea .
I want you to know that .
You should do that before it gets too late .
She does whatever comes into her mind .
Tom doesn &apos;t like eating fish .
I want you to come with us .
Tom is doing everything he can to help .
It &apos;s what I want to do .
The answer misses the point .
I had two dogs .
Not everybody will be able to understand this .
Tom had never been so busy before .
He is proud of his family .
Tom asked Mary if she needed some help .
I &apos;d like to know the reason why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom is good at what he does .
Nothing &apos;s going to happen .
You must be here by five .
Come anytime you like .
My brother is now in Australia .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
Tom wrote the report .
You can see the whole city from here .
Keep an eye on Tom .
Do you know how dangerous that is ?
What would you like to do while you &apos;re here ?
I know Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
I think your letter is under that book .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
Tom pretended everything was OK .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll like it .
You should learn French .
When do you want to do this ?
I &apos;ll wait here until she comes .
I think it &apos;ll be raining tomorrow .
Tom is reading it .
Watch the road .
I need to learn French .
Tom speaks French a little .
The new movie was a big hit .
I heard someone call my name .
All I can think about is next month &apos;s vacation . I haven &apos;t been on one in so long .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
This is better than nothing .
You &apos;ve got my computer and I want it back .
He seems happy .
This is the first time that I have been here .
Thanks for having me here .
I met Tom on the street .
That &apos;s not what Tom does .
Tom came alone .
Why are your eyes so big ?
I think Tom should be home with his children .
What does Tom know about me ?
Be nice to others .
Tom believes Mary .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to answer Mary &apos;s question .
Why does Tom do it ?
We &apos;re not doing it .
You know enough .
I do that every week .
I wish I had more money with me .
I really ought to go .
Are there any questions ?
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
Why do you think that Tom did that ?
The only one here who doesn &apos;t enjoy doing that is Tom .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
That is really good news .
Do your homework now .
I want to do what &apos;s best for both of us .
I became very ill .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
Tom shouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
I made a decision .
I &apos;m in danger .
Tom has lots of time .
Why do you have to do it ?
Who &apos;s going to pay for all of this ?
This room is too small for us .
The days are getting longer .
I can hardly believe it .
Why do I have to study French ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
I played with Tom and Mary today .
Where did you find the keys ?
I &apos;ll go to Boston to be with family .
Let &apos;s get back to work .
He had few other friends .
I want one !
You &apos;re a good man .
She decided to marry Tom .
I am surprised to learn this .
Tom is pretty much finished .
Where &apos;s my car ?
Why did you even bother to come ?
Tom is very hungry .
This isn &apos;t really true .
Tom immediately began playing again .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to cook very well .
Where are your people ?
Don &apos;t you say a word .
Why is Tom out here ?
They &apos;re not here .
Tom won &apos;t even look at me .
Are you busy ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
I &apos;ve seen you somewhere before .
That &apos;s a tree .
Tom stayed at home .
What did you do there ?
Don &apos;t play with fire .
I sometimes see him on TV .
Add more water .
I &apos;m afraid Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom plays piano .
Tom should win .
I go to the movies once a month .
I think Tom believes everything Mary says .
Tom didn &apos;t see a thing .
Tom has done it already .
I know that .
When are you going to talk to Tom about that ?
We must do this right now .
Tom knew I &apos;d be there .
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee .
Tom thought Mary was in the room .
Tom asked something .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
I never thought I &apos;d win .
It &apos;s good that you &apos;re here .
Tom can &apos;t help the way he is .
This won &apos;t take long .
They &apos;re leaving us .
Where did you get to know her ?
It &apos;s you who doesn &apos;t understand .
Where are my clothes ?
It &apos;s not my fault .
Winter is cold , but I like it .
Tom wasn &apos;t so sure himself .
Ask Tom to help you .
Tom said that Mary may do that .
Did you like Tom ?
Everyone needs friends .
I speak French every day .
How well can you play tennis ?
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
Tom is already here , but Mary hasn &apos;t gotten here yet .
I need something to eat .
Tom and Mary want to get married .
Tom called me from Australia .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
They &apos;ll need help .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe anything Mary says .
Why is this so expensive ?
You gave Tom the money he asked for , didn &apos;t you ?
I can do that right now .
Release him .
I used to live near Tom .
I don &apos;t like dogs .
Where did you stay in Boston ?
Tom had already eaten lunch when Mary arrived .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I haven &apos;t spoken French for years .
How long does it take by car ?
There is one less .
The house belongs to him .
I know nothing about you .
I hope my boss agrees to my plan .
What makes you think that I like you ?
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
Are you satisfied with your job ?
He is my brother .
You lost the game .
I want to work in a hospital .
Tom is doing that again .
What &apos;s this for ?
Tom hardly ever speaks to me anymore .
We don &apos;t know where he is .
Tom is taller than any of the other kids in his class .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be here long .
I &apos;m glad Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom stayed in his car .
What should we expect ?
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
There &apos;s somebody who wants to meet you .
Tom is kind of tall .
Who else is there with you ?
Tom asked Mary to come home .
There are some books on the desk .
I thought Tom had a day off .
I &apos;m studying French now .
How did you lose it ?
He &apos;s at home right now .
I have nothing to say on this matter .
I &apos;ll catch the next bus .
They don &apos;t understand .
I want some money .
Give us three minutes .
I have to see this movie .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows about this yet .
Tom has helped a lot .
Tom had nothing to do with what happened here .
Tom didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
I &apos;ll go with you .
Tom often reads in bed .
He was so tired that he could hardly stand .
Regardless what he does , he does it well .
I thought I knew what to do .
May I go home now ?
Everyone is talking about it .
How long does it take to walk from here to the station ?
You are absolutely correct .
I cannot afford to buy such a thing .
Can I ask why this is so important to you ?
I don &apos;t know any French .
I won &apos;t leave .
That desk does not fit in this room .
Where did you see Tom ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Could you open the window ?
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
We &apos;re not young anymore .
Anybody could do this .
It &apos;s great to have a family .
I had no idea you were here .
I was able to answer the question .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
I think you &apos;re nice .
Why don &apos;t you want to do this ?
What do you like to eat for lunch ?
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
I remember seeing her somewhere .
Tom has just bought a new computer .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
Who would do this ?
I ran out of breath .
Do you have a wife ?
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen Tom .
We &apos;ll go after we eat .
Can you help me ?
Be quiet during the lesson .
Tom didn &apos;t need the money .
I &apos;m happy for Tom and Mary .
Don &apos;t give it to anyone .
I bought this book as a gift for Tom .
I hope you are all well .
Are you mad at me ?
This was all a mistake .
You made it possible .
Why don &apos;t you do that ?
What will your wife think ?
Let me repair it .
Tom walks his dog every morning .
How badly do you want it ?
Can you explain why ?
You &apos;ve made a mistake .
How &apos;s your father ?
Should I try to talk to Tom ?
It &apos;s difficult to answer this question .
I &apos;m in love with you .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
I have no idea what &apos;s going on here .
Don &apos;t be too sure .
I can sing .
That &apos;s not easy .
I wanted to work this summer .
Do you want something to eat ?
Where exactly did you lose it ?
Tom is bad .
Everyone was hungry .
I think Tom is going to like it here .
Where are your keys ?
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
She gave him something to drink .
You can &apos;t leave now .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll make it .
Does Tom have a key ?
I studied English when I was there .
He is not the boy who came here yesterday .
He is always reading .
It feels like that was only yesterday .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
You hardly ate anything .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it .
What do you know about it ?
I wanted to help you .
When was the last time you lost your keys ?
This place is nice and quiet .
I don &apos;t need your help .
Nobody can help me .
I want to know what to expect .
Have you told your mother ?
Tom lost Mary .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom until he gets back .
What is the doctor doing ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t run .
Is he a teacher ?
Can I leave now ?
Why are you doing this to me now ?
Tom has told us a lot about you .
Why haven &apos;t you called ?
Give me your money .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
She put her glasses back on .
You should leave .
It &apos;s easy .
Tom may come .
Come to my house at eight .
Tom can &apos;t find Mary .
Tom loves to read .
Tom is young .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary will come tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t know how that could happen .
Tom never got an award .
Let &apos;s dance .
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
I &apos;m going to go to the doctor this afternoon .
Is your husband at home ?
You shouldn &apos;t have done it .
I have enough money to buy it .
I &apos;m never too busy for you .
Have you made up your mind yet ?
It &apos;s good to be back in Boston .
Tom finally spoke .
I &apos;m not so sure this is such a good idea .
Do you want me to believe that ?
Do you believe Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it &apos;ll happen , but he &apos;s pretty sure that it will happen .
Tom has loved Mary for a long time .
Tom got on the train .
He was married to her sister .
No one knows we &apos;re here .
I want people to know the truth .
I do not feel like doing it .
I really have to go now .
That small one is also mine .
Tom bought a camera for Mary .
We do not know her .
Are you willing to drive me to the station ?
I should not have said that .
Even with his glasses , he doesn &apos;t see very well .
That &apos;s no secret .
She sometimes writes to her son .
Are you free this weekend ?
Tom asked if any of us could speak French .
Are you sure his name is Tom ?
If only it were that simple .
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
Tom was my friend .
Why don &apos;t you go in my place ?
Do you not know who I am ?
Tom had to carry all three suitcases .
She &apos;s gone on a trip .
Tom knows how much Mary loves him .
I knew you &apos;d make it .
I spoke to my parents .
I know a man who can speak French well .
Why didn &apos;t you call ?
That tree looks dead .
I come here as often as I can .
I told him to leave the room .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
May I use your telephone ?
I won &apos;t assist you .
Tom has no idea how long it will take .
This is for Tom .
What kind of person is Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary meant .
Where does Tom want to do that ?
I think this is good .
I need to see you in my office .
Why do you say that ?
We love each other and that &apos;s the only thing that matters .
The woman is reading .
This coffee is too strong for me .
You shouldn &apos;t make fun of Tom .
Will we be there soon ?
My brother plays guitar .
Who bought this ?
Eat and drink .
Can you repair these shoes ?
Let &apos;s wait until the crowd thins out .
I know that voice .
They are still children .
He will be free tomorrow .
I will take it .
I don &apos;t require assistance .
Perhaps you &apos;d better drive .
You didn &apos;t say that before .
I &apos;m no longer angry at you .
I &apos;d like to spend more time with my family .
I hate dogs .
I think Tom will be able to help .
We can do nothing about it .
I will give it to you .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
Do you have my money or not ?
It looks very good .
I haven &apos;t met any woman I wanted to be married to .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
I &apos;ll ask my mother for money .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
He is at work now , but will be coming home at seven .
Tom was having car trouble .
Isn &apos;t there anything you want to tell me ?
You &apos;ve been at it for hours .
They &apos;re outside .
Why didn &apos;t you call ?
Is this your first trip abroad ?
Who ate ?
When did you find this ?
She doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
Are you still married ?
He abandoned the plan .
I think now is the time .
Tell Tom he has to get home before 2 : 30 .
Who &apos;ll drive ?
Tom married into money .
He was made to wait at the station for two hours .
It looks good on you .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do that .
Hand me the letter .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with me .
Is that fun ?
You &apos;ll have a rough time .
Doesn &apos;t that just make you angry ?
I think you should apologize to Tom .
When can I visit you ?
Tom knows what you did .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where we are .
Tom can play tennis better than Mary .
I came by bus .
Tom came to visit us .
Let me know when you &apos;ll be ready .
I &apos;ll go with Tom and Mary .
Did you find another picture ?
When I got back , I found my car missing .
Tom said that he thought it could happen in Boston , too .
I &apos;m not going to be very happy .
I don &apos;t hate Tom anymore .
It &apos;s for my family .
It nearly cost him his life .
He has a lunch .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe it .
My mother gets up early .
Who &apos;s your dad ?
Tom started off strong .
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow .
Tom would never hurt you .
Can you give that to Tom ?
He does not know how to drive a car .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
I &apos;ll see you on Monday .
What should Tom have done ?
Tom and Mary had nothing in the world except each other .
He believes whatever I say .
Everyone &apos;s tired .
Tom was dead .
How are you going to do that ?
Tom is going to go to Boston by car .
You shouldn &apos;t speak so ill of him .
Tom wrote this letter .
Where did you find these ?
We &apos;ve done what we could .
Where &apos;s your family , Tom ?
Tom won &apos;t go alone .
We &apos;re meeting in an hour in front of the hotel .
Why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom is too old for you .
Tom has already gone home .
What does it involve ?
Tom told everybody that he was able to speak three languages .
I really like this car .
What &apos;s in the box ?
Someone &apos;s outside .
I wonder why nobody told me .
Tom and Mary have two cats .
Tom said he was too drunk to help me do that .
Your story is hard to believe .
I stayed .
This is too long .
I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you .
You don &apos;t understand anything .
&quot; That &apos;s not the problem . &quot; &quot; Then what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I &apos;ll give you anything that you want .
Tom says Mary doesn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
I had no idea you could dance .
I didn &apos;t find everything I needed .
You must stick to your promise .
I don &apos;t know where we are .
Do you want me to help you ?
You must learn French .
He can &apos;t walk any more .
I got some money for my birthday .
Maybe we ought to ask Tom .
Never be late for school again .
He is having lunch .
Tom is fortunate .
His daughter has become a beautiful woman .
Tom has been in the hospital for a long time .
Tom is furious .
It may be that he likes his job .
I &apos;ll be good to Tom .
I have a good idea .
Tom is a man you can rely on .
I &apos;m from America .
I thought you might like one of these .
Tom is waiting there for you .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything else ?
She works at a bank .
Say what you want .
What did they do ?
I cannot afford to keep a car .
Tom is in the room .
If you change your mind , let me know .
I &apos;d like that .
It &apos;s raining here in Boston .
I &apos;ll be back by six o &apos;clock .
She asked me if I was all right .
I sat by his side .
I &apos;m looking forward to tomorrow .
You must do exactly what I tell you .
What do you want , Tom ?
I liked this film .
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
Tom knows more .
Do you want to hear the truth ?
He &apos;s still at work .
I want to see Tom .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
He fell ill because he ate too much .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
Tom is not the problem .
Tom is just my age .
I &apos;m thinking about something else .
The dress suits you very well .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
You aren &apos;t here .
She decided to study abroad .
You and I are old friends .
Dinner will be ready in a few minutes .
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
He knows that you know .
This bed is too hard to sleep in .
The rain turned into snow .
I bet you &apos;re wondering how this works .
There was a small box inside the big box .
We mustn &apos;t be late .
We made many mistakes .
The price rose .
Tom asked Mary not to go alone .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen again .
Tom told me that he wasn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
We &apos;ve got a lot of stuff left to do .
Tom was better .
Tom knows what &apos;s coming .
Tom has very little money .
We went for a walk on the beach .
My parents are away on a trip and I &apos;m alone in our house .
Don &apos;t you ever let me hear you talking to your mother like that again .
We &apos;ll do it when we have time .
I have to sleep .
You understand why , don &apos;t you ?
Give me what I want .
That was of great help to me .
I don &apos;t want to talk to him anymore .
You ought to find nice shoes here .
I wanted to do something for Tom .
He asked his friend for advice .
Do you want to be near Tom ?
Tom can drive a car , too .
I wanted to buy the book .
How did you make it ?
It &apos;s been fun .
Tom is sick .
Your suitcase is too heavy .
Tom isn &apos;t here . He &apos;s already left .
I &apos;d be happy to sing for you .
You &apos;ll have to ask someone else .
When are you coming home ?
Tom isn &apos;t listening .
I &apos;m quite sure of that .
She knows nothing about your family .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
The police will find us if we stay here .
No one I know talks to Tom anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t going with you , is he ?
I &apos;ll be late to work .
Tom listens .
Tom got very angry with Mary .
Don &apos;t give up on love .
I hope you know it doesn &apos;t really matter all that much .
Let Tom do this .
I know you &apos;re not scared .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
What did she say ?
Tom went to Boston three days ago .
Stop thinking about it .
I prefer tea to coffee .
Let &apos;s go back to the office .
You &apos;re needed here at the office .
The whole room became silent .
I &apos;m glad to see you here .
Tom speaks French as well as me .
He posed a problem .
Please don &apos;t ask me about Tom .
Tom has been in Boston for a week now .
Which do you like better , tea or coffee ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom know that ?
Could you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
Tom will soon be a father .
I already told you everything I know .
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom may have to do that .
He looks young for his age .
He is angry with me .
I plan to tell Tom that I don &apos;t want to go .
Tom &apos;s suitcase looks very heavy .
I don &apos;t care .
That is her car .
No one else could do my work .
Tell Tom about it .
Tom likes his job .
He has three children .
He &apos;s not stupid .
This is the most fun I &apos;ve had in a long time .
He seldom , if ever , reads a book .
It is possible that I forgot my keys .
You could &apos;ve asked me .
Go see Tom .
What &apos;s Tom up to ?
I have to cook dinner today .
Do you want to talk about it ?
I always walk to school .
Tom blamed me for the accident .
You don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
We need to be cautious .
I need to put the children to bed .
These shoes are too small for me .
It &apos;s none of our business .
Your parents must be so proud of you .
I saw Tom before he saw me .
I &apos;ve been looking for them for more than one hour .
Tom probably got home last Monday .
Can you stop it ?
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do today .
You need to leave .
Tom got out of bed and put his clothes on .
I know where to go .
Where did you find these ?
I wouldn &apos;t blame them .
My daughter &apos;s your age .
He left early in order not to be late .
Everybody has left except Tom and Mary .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
Let &apos;s go !
I should just go home .
I can &apos;t understand Tom .
Is she your mother ?
Which one would you like ?
I &apos;ll be thinking of you today .
Tom became very cold .
Tom isn &apos;t very funny .
You are the one .
What does she do ?
Tom lives with his parents .
He was sitting next to me .
Tom called Mary this morning .
We haven &apos;t even tried .
I think it should &apos;ve been discussed .
Aren &apos;t you new here ?
They are reading her book .
Tom has already left .
Maybe I don &apos;t need Tom .
Tom and Mary are crazy .
Tom is very interesting .
I &apos;d like a car like yours .
You look exactly the same .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like this hotel ?
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
This car looks like mine .
How does Tom do this ?
He is good at cooking .
Tom has gone crazy .
She &apos;s eating for two .
I &apos;m still in love with him .
He won &apos;t make it .
Everybody knows everybody .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Playing the guitar is fun .
There was only one problem .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
You &apos;re looking good .
What is it , Tom ? What &apos;s wrong ?
You &apos;ve just missed Tom .
All I have is books .
Tom would have eaten more if he hadn &apos;t been sick .
I don &apos;t want to die here .
Have you ever tried to swim across this river ?
Do you want this shirt ?
It isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s fault .
How was your trip ?
We arrived at the hotel an hour ago .
This is the house where he lives .
I walked alone .
It was too expensive .
How many do you need ?
You can &apos;t pretend that this didn &apos;t happen .
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
I was new .
We &apos;re coming for you .
I have already finished reading this book .
Is there a message ?
I &apos;ve got to run to the bank .
Tom wanted to talk with Mary .
What just happened here ?
How about a beer ?
What are you going to do for Tom ?
My mother is in the kitchen .
Can we talk about this later ?
I &apos;ve already finished my homework .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
My mother must be angry .
You haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
Tom , could I have a word with you ?
My work is almost finished .
That one &apos;s OK .
We should &apos;ve stayed in Australia until Monday .
I think it &apos;ll rain today .
I need to talk to Tom .
That &apos;s not what I want .
Breakfast is at half past nine .
Tom has a lot of land .
That was quick .
I know Tom does that every morning .
I know you are rich .
I went into Tom &apos;s room .
We &apos;ll see how it goes .
Tom is back in town .
I &apos;m not interested in your opinion .
I stayed up all night .
You &apos;re talking too fast .
I like rain and snow .
What should we tell the others ?
How did you get into my house ?
You don &apos;t understand .
I met your father yesterday .
Tom wants to learn to swim .
She &apos;s not the kind of girl you think she is .
I have nothing to do with the affair .
Tom is as busy as ever .
That &apos;s irrelevant .
I , too , didn &apos;t understand anything .
I think Tom must be hungry .
I often went to the movies with my father .
You should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
I had help .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
We &apos;re going to have a good day .
I like English better .
Tom has been here for about three years .
Tell Tom that when he &apos;s finished , he can leave .
I don &apos;t recall asking for your opinion .
I &apos;ll go let Tom know .
Are you angry at me ?
Here &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
Tom , we have a problem .
Tom received a letter from Mary this morning .
It looks very expensive .
I drove Tom to school .
It &apos;s easy to hear you .
I &apos;ll wait .
I would like to tell you something .
Tom &apos;s not sick .
Tom is a baby .
Did Tom come home ?
I want Tom to be happy .
I was just about to go home .
I never see you without thinking of my father .
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
I want time .
Tom may not be in Boston .
I can &apos;t be late .
She knows nothing about your family .
I took a taxi to get there in time .
What do you do in the afternoon ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;ll be finished .
I don &apos;t want to see this again .
Tom has to go to the hospital .
Tom did it very well .
Tom knew it was wrong .
Tom gave it a try .
I wish Tom would learn to speak French .
How much do you love Tom ?
I &apos;d better drive you home .
Tom understands what needs to be done .
She asked about the others .
All men must die .
I &apos;ve got no plans tonight .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
I think you &apos;d like it in Boston .
You must have a reason for telling me .
This is a very tall tree .
No one knew that .
It &apos;s a good movie .
I &apos;ve already tried .
He asked for the money .
Here &apos;s the key to my apartment .
She has flowers in her hand .
Tom never talks about his job .
Is it a good play ?
Let it be .
Let &apos;s leave her alone .
He can &apos;t cook very well .
He doesn &apos;t come here every day .
I will give you the money tomorrow .
I &apos;ll take your word on that .
Nothing can be produced out of nothing .
Why wasn &apos;t anything about that in the report ?
If I &apos;d only listened to my parents !
I know the drill .
Tom never would &apos;ve asked .
I asked Tom to be quiet .
Do you object to smoking ?
We should &apos;ve stayed home with Tom .
Will you help me for a minute ?
Tom lost his new watch .
I see no reason not to .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
Why did she ask for our help ?
Since it was Sunday , the store was closed .
He got very drunk .
Tom made this for Mary .
We know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his way back home .
His plan is dangerous !
I wish I could have spoken more English .
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow .
When are you going ?
I won &apos;t go .
He learned to swim .
I &apos;m going to the hospital .
I can &apos;t talk about it right now .
Tom opened the door for the dog .
I took her home .
Can you show me ?
They can &apos;t afford it .
Tom can swim fast .
I have nothing to write .
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
We don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
Where can one buy books ?
Tom was very busy today .
When did you finish the work ?
Tom knows how to read French .
Did you get their letter ?
I had to carry Tom &apos;s suitcase for him .
I paid thirty dollars for these shoes .
You don &apos;t have to do it , but you should .
We &apos;ll be here .
Have Tom do that .
Father drives to work .
I didn &apos;t know how to do it , but I was willing to give it a try .
Do you know why he couldn &apos;t come ?
Maybe I &apos;ll go , and maybe I won &apos;t .
Are you hungry yet ?
I have a right to be on this ship .
What do you mean by that ?
Mary is helping her mother .
Let &apos;s go !
I don &apos;t have any friends to help me .
You should pay for it .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
Tom will probably like this game .
Open the door .
Tom and Mary are the same age as John .
When will you visit me again ?
Tom may have to help Mary .
He does everything very quickly .
I don &apos;t know what Tom did with it .
Tom wanted to see Mary .
There &apos;s no point in worrying about it now .
You should work hard .
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible .
I was unable to go outside .
Tom looks very sleepy .
I have no friend to talk with .
Tom can play tennis quite well .
I have a hunch that it will rain .
Tom will cook .
I asked Tom where he had gone to school .
You look like your mother .
I &apos;d like to talk about your situation .
Please tell them where they need to go .
Tom put down his suitcase .
Tom told me I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary is .
Tom is good at causing problems .
I &apos;ve got a message for you from Tom .
It &apos;s the first time that anybody said something like that to me .
This is what my mother gave me when I got married .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word about it !
Is that a boy or a girl ?
I think this is the way to do it .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t ready yet .
Is Tom ready to leave ?
What is on the desk ?
Tom got drunk again last night .
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school .
Can you read ?
Tom knew a lot .
We &apos;ll be there .
You &apos;re working hard .
Tom believed in me .
They had no idea what needed to be done .
Who benefited from that ?
Is this yours , Tom ?
Tom is old .
Were you telling the truth ?
I &apos;m a friend of Tom and Mary &apos;s .
Is this a new car ?
He can be relied on .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with John .
He keeps a cat .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Tom is jittery .
They &apos;re almost three times as big as we are .
I bought it for 10 dollars .
I can &apos;t live without Tom .
It wasn &apos;t important to me .
Are you free this weekend ?
I &apos;m giving up on it .
Did he go to see Mary ?
Tom frequently speaks with Mary .
We had a lot of fun together today , didn &apos;t we ?
I had lunch with Tom .
Tom said he thought the room was too small .
Tom wrote two books .
The moment he caught sight of me , he ran away .
This one is Tom &apos;s .
Tom seemed very surprised when I told him about what had happened .
He did not have enough money .
I want to go to bed .
I can &apos;t gain weight , no matter what I eat .
I didn &apos;t write that .
I haven &apos;t heard from anyone .
If I knew anything , I &apos;d tell you .
I had nothing to say to Tom .
There &apos;s so much more to learn .
I am eating lunch with my sister .
Tom said he saw Mary doing that .
I like to watch TV .
Yesterday I had my bicycle stolen .
I had my watch repaired .
What have you been up to ?
Tom looks weary .
He telephoned me again and again .
Does she have a boyfriend ?
She dressed herself quickly .
Tom and I are very busy just now .
He may have missed the train .
Do you want to hear it ?
I didn &apos;t know you could do that .
You need to help me .
How did you like it ?
A fire broke out nearby .
I think Tom knows French .
Tom took the money off the table .
What time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
We &apos;ll go a week from today .
I must speak with you alone .
I take my health seriously .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
I &apos;ll prove it to you .
You &apos;re going to be so happy here .
I &apos;m very glad I got to know you .
He wrote a letter .
I think you &apos;ll want to see this .
What beautiful flowers !
I can explain everything .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
You can &apos;t scare me .
He doesn &apos;t eat this , does he ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
She &apos;s too young to get married .
Tom learned how to swim when he was three .
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend .
Why did you buy the flowers ?
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV .
He might not be happy .
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary &apos;s school .
My guess is that it will rain soon .
I &apos;ve just gotten home .
Many of you speak French , right ?
What do you think of this work ?
I met him once .
We &apos;re not where we want to be .
You should &apos;ve said so earlier .
That &apos;s what we want .
I hope you know that .
Can &apos;t you help us ?
What we need is help .
You aren &apos;t me .
Both of my parents don &apos;t know how to swim .
Tom bought drinks for everybody .
Now I feel sorry for her .
I see that it is raining .
I &apos;m in my car .
Where did they go ?
I know you &apos;re trying very hard .
He has a lot of money , but has almost no friends .
I &apos;m not satisfied yet .
Tom is going to do that again .
We have nothing else .
My sight isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
Tom will be thirty this year .
I think Tom should go .
Isn &apos;t that good enough ?
He had no money .
You &apos;ve been very good to me .
You &apos;d better not tell him .
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog .
Isn &apos;t that your dictionary ?
Tom speaks French really well .
Don &apos;t you want to go , too ?
Last night , my wife and I went to a friend &apos;s house for dinner .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell me ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
Do you know where Tom &apos;s car is parked ?
I speak French at home .
This is going to be long .
Nobody understands me .
Please give me another chance .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
I can carry that for you if you &apos;d like me to .
This is our friend Tom .
You &apos;re doing it wrong !
It &apos;s not easy .
Who wants another piece of cake ?
Tom wasn &apos;t young .
He put the book on the table .
It was his fault .
Let &apos;s meet in front of the hotel .
That doesn &apos;t happen very often .
I just can &apos;t believe they &apos;re getting married .
I &apos;m not a mind reader . You need to tell me what you want .
Tom should go help Mary .
Night is when most people go to bed .
He has a crush on this girl .
I will deal with this problem .
That &apos;s not very good , is it ?
Go look for it .
I failed the exam .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything to me .
Tom has already seen it .
Tom watches TV with the kids every evening .
She gave money .
Cut that out !
Tom looked good today .
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
He has a lot of money in the bank .
Let me go alone .
I &apos;m the only one who understands you .
I have to take my son to the doctor .
That sounds stupid .
This bike is easy to ride .
Tom won &apos;t live much longer .
I &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
You &apos;re big .
What else do you have in your pocket ?
Is there a cat under the table ?
My sister married a doctor .
Tom has always been strong .
Does Tom have a car ?
Do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
What &apos;s the horse &apos;s name ?
Do you want to see the house ?
Tell Tom I don &apos;t like him .
Why didn &apos;t you call us ?
You &apos;re just like your father .
I don &apos;t know how long it &apos;ll take .
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
Let Tom eat whatever he wants .
He asked me if I was busy .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wants Mary to want him .
I just got home from school .
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
How did you get so good at French ?
Tom is going to tell the truth .
They don &apos;t like to do that .
I think this book is very good .
I heard that he &apos;d died .
We learn a good deal at school .
You don &apos;t need to come so early .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary &apos;s over thirty .
What is this girl &apos;s name ?
When I saw him last , he was still a child .
I have known that for a long time .
If anyone can do it , Tom can .
Did you like Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to go , does he ?
I feel sorry for her .
I haven &apos;t seen much of him recently .
Tom didn &apos;t take much persuading .
She was very beautiful when she was young .
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
What is it that you want ?
Have you forgotten about me ?
I &apos;ve never had a friend quite like you .
I &apos;m glad to be here .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
Anyone can make a mistake .
What would the world be like without women ?
Thanks for this .
They often help each other .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
Mary has a new boyfriend .
The car is in the way . Please move it .
Could you lend me a hand ?
They are the same age .
That does it .
This is easy .
I gave him a call .
They &apos;ve lost so much .
Tom knows he isn &apos;t welcome here .
I might as well do it now .
I used to like walking in the rain when I was a child .
I want to live .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary .
What have you been doing all week ?
I read about that .
I know everybody here .
What were you doing when I called this morning ?
You never can tell what will happen in the future .
Tom put on his glasses and opened the book .
Who is already awake ?
Everything went well with him .
It &apos;s difficult for me to understand French when it &apos;s spoken quickly .
He is having lunch now .
Where was Tom born ?
I know who we &apos;re dealing with .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
How &apos;ve you been keeping ?
I &apos;m used to people not agreeing with me .
She went home .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
I &apos;d ask Tom .
When will you leave ?
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
You have very little time left .
Tom had to catch a taxi .
I didn &apos;t let them know .
We have plenty of time now .
This coat fits me very well .
I shook hands with Tom and left .
The computer is in the library .
Maybe your name really is Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
I &apos;d be happy to sing for you .
Tom is the same age as I am .
I &apos;ll try to say it in French .
Tom got up .
I am surprised to see you here in this hotel .
I want to make Tom happy .
What &apos;s Boston like ?
I &apos;ll get to it .
Who likes Tom ?
This happens to me all the time .
He asked me whether I was busy .
I had a good time .
They were lucky .
I &apos;m hungry because I haven &apos;t had lunch .
That &apos;s very good .
Get out of the water .
Are you free this evening ?
Let &apos;s hit the hay .
Nobody had an answer .
She &apos;s found herself a boyfriend .
Where did you get that ?
Tom felt nothing .
I don &apos;t think that happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here , does he ?
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary was .
Nobody &apos;s hungry .
We had so much fun together .
What &apos;re you saying ?
He &apos;ll be safe with me .
Why does Tom want to be a teacher ?
I think Mary likes me .
Tom asked some of his friends for their opinions .
It is stupid of you to believe in him .
Is that love ?
How did you make it ?
Tom already knows what Mary wants to do .
Tom was never content .
She was there in the morning .
Keep the door closed .
I wish I were dead .
I already said I &apos;m not going .
Do you not know who I am ?
She is no less beautiful than her mother .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
I &apos;d love to live in Boston .
I asked Tom to come .
The cops are on their way .
Tom had nothing to do with it .
I asked Tom to open the window .
That is the house where I was born .
Why &apos;s that important ?
You &apos;ve been a great help .
I didn &apos;t say anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t coming .
Tom knew he couldn &apos;t win .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
Tom will stay with us .
Tom seems to know the way .
You make me very nervous .
I should &apos;ve been there .
It was my decision .
That &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t know .
Wouldn &apos;t you like another glass of beer ?
How many apples are there ?
My brother is in Australia now .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
You should always keep your word .
Do you have a key to Tom &apos;s apartment ?
It looks like Tom is afraid .
I feel perfectly fine .
It &apos;s too far away .
Everything is now ready for you .
I &apos;m losing .
I will be back soon .
Tom received help .
I understood almost nothing .
Tom walked over to the desk .
What time is the meeting ?
She wasn &apos;t able to meet him .
Tom met Mary for breakfast .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Perhaps I &apos;ll like this book .
Tom makes a lot more money than I do .
We were best friends .
Tom became very ill .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at school ?
Don &apos;t give it to Tom .
Do you want to hear the truth ?
Tom is as busy as I am .
I don &apos;t feel like going out for a walk .
Can you take me home now ?
If it weren &apos;t for her help , I would not be alive now .
I heard you talking .
Don &apos;t show off .
The girl doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
My dog is almost half the size of yours .
We have to do it together .
The world is small .
Nobody came to work this morning .
Tell me if you need anything else .
This one &apos;s on me .
You aren &apos;t invited .
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
Tom doesn &apos;t want it .
Tom is no longer living in Boston .
Everyone was happy .
Pay very close attention .
Tom seems hungry .
Tom might hear you .
What are you doing to me ?
Has it arrived ?
We &apos;ll sing .
No one knows .
French is one of the languages I &apos;ve always wanted to learn .
Tom is about your age .
Tom told Mary about John .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come here .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
We are sorry about the bad weather .
What did Tom give Mary ?
This is not good at all .
I can &apos;t really believe that .
How was your trip ?
Tom is from here .
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else does .
I wasn &apos;t the only person Tom talked to .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary has done .
It &apos;s as simple as that .
I went to the room .
You can &apos;t just pretend that nothing happened .
I believe Tom is correct .
Is it really worth it ?
This should be more than enough .
If we begin early , we can finish by lunch .
Tom seemed to be telling the truth .
Tom would love to see this .
Today you turn four years old .
I hope he &apos;ll get better soon .
He drives fast .
Do you want to see Tom ?
You got hurt , didn &apos;t you ?
He often walks to school .
I just want to have fun .
I went to bed later than usual last night .
I know why he did it .
He has enough money to buy it .
We have to talk .
I &apos;ll be with Tom and Mary .
He and I are friends .
I feel like telling him what I think of him .
I just need to talk to you .
Tom , can I have a moment with you alone ?
Tom speaks French fairly well .
He became rich .
Tom said he heard Mary say that .
I want to stay in Boston for a few more days .
I am quite opposed to the plan .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom , but he said he didn &apos;t want to go with me .
No one is listening to you .
We all have a lot to learn .
Tom texted Mary .
That wasn &apos;t your decision to make .
Her hair is long .
I saw you there .
This book is easy enough for them to read .
I didn &apos;t know you had a boyfriend .
Is there anything else you want to know ?
How fast did Tom run ?
Is it large enough ?
When do you want it ?
When do we want it ?
We are students .
He &apos;s right behind me .
You must start at once .
We could not see anyone in the street .
I usually eat less than my boyfriend .
Can &apos;t they speak French ?
They aren &apos;t hungry .
Do they have a computer ?
Tom and Mary had three children .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party yesterday .
I am proud to work with you .
Tom is a good friend of mine .
I &apos;m not able to swim .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
Tom said he &apos;d do that .
I will go at 10 .
Thank you for coming early .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
Why don &apos;t I do that ?
You always do that by yourself , don &apos;t you ?
Tom started it .
Do you know who said that ?
How does Tom get to school ?
You can hear everything .
I don &apos;t want to play with you .
Tom wants to do that , too .
Tom did everything he could to help Mary .
Is it cold outside ?
Do you want me to call Tom ?
Leave us alone .
What are you reading right now ?
I know that Tom does that every morning .
Finish this .
Where are we now ?
This is quite difficult for Tom .
This house is large enough for your family to live in .
We know each other very well .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
Women are better at this than men .
I speak French and English .
Be careful what you say and how you say it .
I didn &apos;t call Tom from Australia .
He ran away with the money .
Tom and I have worked together for over three years .
I &apos;m going to work by bicycle .
Do you know who this belongs to ?
It was easy for him to solve the problem .
Tom is unrelated .
Tom spends too much money .
I &apos;m very afraid .
You should &apos;ve come yesterday .
I &apos;m sorry if I hurt your feelings .
I closed my door .
What is Tom to you ?
He seemed to know everything about me .
When did you last see my brother ?
Tom seems to have lost his passport .
Is Tom still on the job ?
I &apos;ll sleep here .
You have a task to complete .
Her name is Mary .
You will never be alone .
Tom isn &apos;t hungry .
Let &apos;s sing and dance .
It &apos;s easy for her to make friends .
He looked as if he had been ill .
This book is not available in Japan .
I don &apos;t understand English .
Tom , are all these books yours ?
I came here yesterday .
&quot; What time is it now ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s 3 : 30 . &quot;
This house is too big for us .
When did you buy it ?
Do you want some more tea ?
They can &apos;t believe it .
Tom said goodnight .
Tom is not in .
Who found my bag ?
Can you please help ?
You are a woman .
I saw Tom &apos;s father .
It is difficult , if not impossible , to solve this problem .
Why do you think that ?
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
You didn &apos;t have to do that .
Whoever wants the book may have it .
Only Tom and Mary were at home .
You should &apos;ve told me sooner .
I wish he had attended the meeting .
I heard her singing in her room .
Go home now .
I need someone to understand me .
I want to know more about your country .
Tom needs you .
Tom is short .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom .
The man behind them is playing the piano .
He wants to come with us .
She is almost as tall as you .
Nobody cares about me .
Tom still intends to go .
What are we doing out here ?
We need to speak with you .
This is simply not true .
You should do it like this .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
I know a lot about Australia .
Return this book as soon as you can .
I would like to speak with Tom .
I just don &apos;t feel like going to school today .
We know you &apos;re very rich .
I want Tom .
I arrived here yesterday .
I knew what had happened .
How does it look ?
The old doctor takes pride in his work .
Are they here ?
He shut the door .
Tom didn &apos;t say that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it happened .
What &apos;s the date of the letter ?
Tom is expecting to meet you here .
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
I saw her at the station .
Give me another beer .
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
Tom didn &apos;t say a word .
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
She must be very happy .
I hear she is going to get married next month .
Don &apos;t show your face around here again .
We will fix this .
I bought this book for myself , not for my wife .
We go there often .
I have a lot of flowers .
Have you ever seen Tom eat ?
Tom is quite happy .
Tom and Mary are about the same size .
I &apos;ll see you on Monday in Boston .
They understand now .
Is it too late ?
Nobody knows his name .
We &apos;ve only got three days .
When do I get to meet Tom ?
You &apos;ll get it .
I let go of Tom &apos;s hand .
We don &apos;t need them .
Please come into the light so that I can see you better .
I talked to Tom last week .
Why would Tom want to go there ?
What does Tom think ?
Tom must be Mary &apos;s father .
This hat is too small for me .
Do you think Tom told us the truth ?
Are there any questions ?
They &apos;ll probably come by car .
She &apos;s just acting disappointed .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
Tom left his wife .
You &apos;re three years older than me .
He admitted his mistakes .
Would you like to have some tea ?
Did they say how ?
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
I &apos;d like to , but I can &apos;t .
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
Tom is married , Mary isn &apos;t .
Tom told me he was disappointed .
Where did you get that hat ?
She herself gave him something to eat .
We are working for you .
Tom called Mary to apologize to her , but she hung up on him .
My father is as busy as ever .
I came here to make you an offer .
We have to do something to stop this from happening again .
Tom made coffee .
My son can neither read nor write yet .
Tom took the day off .
I &apos;m still your boss .
I want to speak in French .
That was really difficult .
I &apos;ve started learning French .
Cold this morning , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ll talk with you when you &apos;re not busy .
It &apos;s been raining since last night .
Where can we meet you ?
I don &apos;t want to live here anymore .
I have to be here .
I want to stay a few days .
I &apos;m very sorry I did that .
I &apos;m free tonight .
I am not older than he is .
Tom was looking for you .
What do you think about this plan ?
He is sure to win the game .
Did Tom work for you ?
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s condition ?
Tom stood on his head .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know why Mary wants to do that .
I went to Boston on Monday .
Tom gave a speech .
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
What did you do with my book ?
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
It &apos;s the truth .
You &apos;d better not tell Tom .
They love coffee .
I &apos;d like to see you this afternoon .
Give me three more apples .
I could show you around the city .
There is nothing going on between Tom and me .
I got a new camera .
Tom likes to listen to music while he &apos;s doing his homework .
They &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
I cannot tell you everything that happened to me yesterday .
She &apos;s wearing a hat .
I would like to tell you something .
Tom didn &apos;t do that for us .
You two probably want to be alone .
I need to sit down .
Isn &apos;t life beautiful ?
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom can afford it .
I never thought I &apos;d find a woman like you .
He gets angry very easily .
Tom will soon become a father .
Is Tom good at swimming ?
I should go help Tom .
You can &apos;t leave until we say you can leave .
Please tell me where we &apos;re going .
Tom isn &apos;t home yet .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Tom and Mary have been married for over 30 years .
I &apos;m very , very happy for Tom .
That &apos;s what I want most .
There &apos;s still one thing I don &apos;t understand .
Tom has already done a lot for us .
I know what Tom likes .
He tried it over and over again .
I said I &apos;d look after you .
We &apos;re going dancing tonight .
He seems as busy as ever .
Did you make this yourself ?
Give these children three pieces each .
Tom will help Mary tomorrow .
We do what we want .
Where is the beach ?
Did you finish your homework ?
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you . You must ask someone else .
Who did it ?
We have work to do .
Tom won &apos;t make it in time .
I can swim as well as you .
She ate her dinner .
We couldn &apos;t do anything for them .
You must make the decision on your own .
Tom is one of my best students .
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
How did Tom die ?
Just listening to that song makes me think of you .
It &apos;s not like you think .
Tom says he enjoys studying French .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here today .
It would be better for you to read more books .
I hope he will come .
Don &apos;t give up !
Tom said he didn &apos;t need our help .
Do you really enjoy doing that kind of thing ?
I have to answer his letter .
It &apos;ll rain soon .
Get out of my way .
I got furious when Tom said that .
I don &apos;t want you to die .
Tom heard Mary singing in the kitchen .
She asked us to be quiet .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
They made me go there alone .
I can &apos;t let Tom see me like this .
Tom has gone to Boston .
I know you really like Tom .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you ever again .
I can &apos;t get along with him .
You know how important this job is to me , don &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s not love .
It was for Tom .
Is this your bike ?
Tom was the one who wrote this story .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you want .
She will get well in a week .
I still have to do that .
You &apos;ll learn a lot here .
We have to do it .
See you at school .
Who is it that you want to talk to ?
Tom got stood up .
I &apos;ll come home .
We were on the train for ten hours .
What &apos;s it worth ?
How long have you been standing here ?
He doesn &apos;t love his girlfriend .
I sat between Tom and Mary .
I can &apos;t remember everyone .
I just want to talk .
It was a good idea .
We need more food .
Tom moved to Boston three years ago .
He hasn &apos;t written to them in a long time .
You need a key to open the box .
I don &apos;t want to play anymore .
Where could he be ?
What are you up to today ?
You may have it .
I remember seeing her before .
What were you doing about this time yesterday ?
What does Tom want you to do ?
You don &apos;t have to work today .
Tom is almost always at home on Sundays .
Tom is coming with us .
This book was written by Tom .
I want the other one .
If you really want to know , all you need to do is ask .
You have to find Tom .
Tom is now in jail .
You &apos;re going to be OK .
Tom still lives at home .
There must be another way .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear shoes inside the house .
Everyone is very proud of you .
I need new shoes .
Your father will be so proud of you .
I looked at my dog .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Tom is good at it , too .
Tom admitted he couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom is really big .
What happened to the money ?
Tom watched Mary work .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
I don &apos;t like this shirt . Please show me another one .
I should have left earlier .
Tom doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s his fault .
They had no money left .
Tom went to Boston yesterday .
What &apos;s your name ?
I feel the same .
Tom thinks that Mary may do that .
Do you really want to go back to Boston ?
What are you really here for anyway ?
We don &apos;t have a single thing to worry about .
Tom is going to be happy .
I took Monday off .
I don &apos;t think you know what you want .
What are you going to do in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is busy or not .
He proceeded to the next question .
That &apos;s what I like about Tom .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
How do you cope with so many people disliking you ?
I &apos;d like to , but I can &apos;t .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Most students don &apos;t like homework .
Our friends took a walk in the park .
I turned to him for advice .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be careful .
Are these your things ?
Tom is around thirty years old .
I know what Tom said .
Tom has never been sick .
You don &apos;t really care , do you ?
I hope the weather stays this way .
She is no longer what she used to be .
Tom was sitting alone in his room .
You &apos;re nervous .
I know you like Tom .
I &apos;m learning how to drive .
I can &apos;t find my bag .
There &apos;s nothing more you can do for me .
Ask him his name .
An apple fell off the tree .
Your table is ready .
Tom was obviously drunk .
I &apos;m sorry I didn &apos;t call .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
I saw Tom this morning .
I don &apos;t hate you anymore .
Tom should come .
That is something you should not have said .
Tom wondered why Mary was so mad .
No one ate anything .
I saw Tom play tennis .
She always speaks English .
I have to go back to work .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
Tom has come .
It &apos;ll happen .
I might not have to do that until October .
I want to see your boss .
Since it &apos;s important , I &apos;ll attend to it .
They live nearby .
Tom can barely read .
The park is filled with children .
We &apos;re too late .
Do you remember who told you that ?
We &apos;ll get one .
We &apos;re with you .
Tom didn &apos;t hear Mary enter the room .
An accident has happened .
How long have you been abroad ?
Don &apos;t let Tom near my kids .
Go back outside .
That &apos;s from Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
We don &apos;t know why .
This train is bound for Boston .
They got to be good friends .
I &apos;d like to do that .
She invited us to her birthday party .
She loves Tom more than she loves me .
Tom shouldn &apos;t always believe what others say .
I hate it when you pretend like you don &apos;t know me .
That &apos;s me .
Tom finally came home .
You are as tall as my sister .
Tom is no longer a boy .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to see what he &apos;s doing .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
Tom came by car .
Which did you eat , fish or meat ?
Can &apos;t we leave it as it is ?
Tom won &apos;t be back tomorrow .
I don &apos;t see your name on it .
Tom is helping Mary .
Tom will never see you again .
Was Tom the one who did this ?
What are you doing out here ?
I &apos;m busy now .
We come here every day .
Be quiet for a second .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday !
You must go to school .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom saw someone .
He came at about four o &apos;clock .
The only girl that will even talk to Tom is Mary .
The students are back .
Stop saying that !
She is going to have a baby .
Tom studies French .
Have you read this book already ?
Why didn &apos;t anybody do anything ?
What can you tell me about Tom ?
I thought I knew him , but I didn &apos;t .
Could you show me the way to the station ?
Are you sure you can do this ?
Tom asked me if I wanted to dance .
You should be proud of yourself .
We play tennis after school .
I &apos;m hoping that Tom never does that again .
We need to get this done by 2 : 30 .
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
We understand why .
Now they have three children .
When was it you first met Tom ?
Tell Tom we &apos;re waiting for him .
Perhaps I can help you .
Tom is on his way home .
Tom is in Australia already .
Tom has been here for years .
I asked Tom if he was OK .
Tom gave me this watch .
Why did you even bother to come ?
I &apos;m not well .
Did you get something to eat ?
I hate milk .
They were satisfied .
He needs it .
Tom had trouble getting his suitcase opened .
Tom asked Mary to give a speech .
Tom drove .
I don &apos;t have a wife .
Tom isn &apos;t really in love with Mary .
I was too drunk .
I am sure of his passing the exam .
Do you know where you are , Tom ?
I ache all over .
Tom and I are both very proud of you .
Life is very short .
Tom is a little taller than me .
What do you want me to do , Tom ?
This is a picture .
What &apos;re you doing in Boston ?
Don &apos;t you want me here ?
The decision is yours .
I was lucky to get this job .
Aren &apos;t you going to ask ?
We &apos;re all proud of you .
Breakfast is at half past nine .
Where shall I wait for you ?
I chose to stay .
This room is just about big enough .
It &apos;s not worth reading any further .
It looks fine .
I still don &apos;t understand how it works .
I said I &apos;ll do it .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
Where &apos;s the nearest doctor ?
Take these .
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle ?
Have we met before ?
It &apos;s happened to me .
Without air and water , nothing could live .
You have to believe in yourself .
She thinks that she &apos;s always right .
It has been two years since he came to Japan .
Let &apos;s try !
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
He went to school by car .
You can &apos;t let the dog out of the yard .
I &apos;ll go and have a look .
Tom just left .
What are you going to have ?
I want a cup of tea .
We have to go to school .
She &apos;s three years older than I am .
I don &apos;t see why Tom wanted me to be here today .
How did you lose it ?
Those two don &apos;t get along .
Were you looking for Tom ?
She is very busy .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
We must not do that .
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
You &apos;re one of Tom &apos;s kids , aren &apos;t you ?
We can &apos;t do that either .
I wish I knew where he was !
Why couldn &apos;t you come yesterday ?
There &apos;s a car coming .
They know what &apos;s going on .
It is not far away from the hotel .
Tom , I want you to have this .
Tom gets up at six .
We can &apos;t stay here .
Tom and Mary are waiting for John and Alice .
Tom can hear Mary very well .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive .
This book isn &apos;t very good .
You never come over anymore .
I did what Tom told me to do .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
I &apos;ll come back soon .
You &apos;d better leave now .
I didn &apos;t want to be left alone .
You have three cats .
Tom won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Tom always worries about his daughter .
I haven &apos;t understood anything you &apos;ve said .
It &apos;s far too small .
You &apos;re just doing your job .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
You didn &apos;t need to do that .
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
I wish I could help .
It &apos;s difficult to help people that don &apos;t want your help .
She will not stick to her word .
I wasn &apos;t sure if Tom had eaten yet .
It &apos;s my belief that knowledge is power .
I should &apos;ve gone home .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;ll be at home tonight .
This book isn &apos;t as interesting as that book .
Is there anything else I can help you with ?
I have finished my homework .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but a teacher .
Are you planning to help them ?
Tom tried to swim .
I wish we &apos;d done that .
It doesn &apos;t matter now .
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
I was worried .
We &apos;re workaholics .
We want to be here for Tom .
I couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
Tom walked to the store to buy some milk .
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
How do you know Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
I got home yesterday afternoon at about 2 : 30 .
It appears to me that you are right .
I &apos;m back .
Tom had Mary do that .
I hope Tom comes .
It &apos;ll surely rain today .
Tom sat on the bench with Mary .
Tom looks strong .
Tom is not welcome in our home .
You &apos;re standing in my way .
I want Tom to have this .
He did not buy it after all .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t tell you that .
We succeeded !
Tom and Mary got along very well .
I &apos;m feeling fine now .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Can &apos;t we just talk this over ?
Aren &apos;t you going to introduce us ?
You have no idea who that is , do you ?
I want to know where they &apos;ve taken Tom .
We plan to leave as soon as possible .
Tom sat at his desk doing his homework .
You can do it .
Is it this hot every day ?
I haven &apos;t quite made up my mind .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is telling the truth or not .
He opened his mouth wide .
My watch is five minutes fast .
Nobody visits Tom .
I do not like this song .
Do you want another one of these ?
He didn &apos;t say anything .
Are you sure that &apos;s what it was ?
He is sick .
I want to hear more about this .
She is about my age .
I &apos;m from Boston .
I must get it fixed .
Tom believes everything I say .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
Close your eyes .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is going to do .
Tell me why you think that .
Tom appeared busy .
Here &apos;s $ 5 .
What &apos;s the time now ?
Tom and Mary will get married sooner or later .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party , but nobody knows why .
It didn &apos;t even cross my mind .
The lights went out .
Do you have a friend named Tom ?
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
It is better for you to do it now .
I want a new car .
The water is cold .
Tom saw Mary at the station .
Tom made us do that .
If I get rich , I will buy it .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
I heard you talking to Tom .
Tom won &apos;t have time to do that .
You remember Tom and Mary , don &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s yesterday &apos;s news .
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
I remember seeing her once .
He is writing a letter to his parents now .
Tom is a really nice kid .
Where did you learn all that ?
Why are you scared of Tom ?
You can find somebody else to help you .
His son is ill .
I liked your story .
My grandfather speaks very slowly .
It doesn &apos;t need to be white , but I &apos;d prefer white .
He is not as tall as his brother .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us ?
Who teaches you French ?
You must eat something .
Where do you guys live ?
I think he likes you .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
I &apos;ve heard nothing .
I &apos;m not doing it again .
She killed herself yesterday .
Tom will be giving a speech today .
What &apos;s your decision ?
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher .
I have no time to help you with the work .
She told him to study .
What &apos;s it we &apos;re waiting for ?
We took a walk in the park .
I &apos;m not afraid anymore .
I came to say I &apos;m sorry .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
Have a piece of pie .
Tom is good at playing tennis .
It &apos;s very cold today .
She &apos;s beautiful .
I &apos;ve just finished doing that .
I &apos;m happy to see you .
Do you want something to drink ?
Your mother loves me .
What time did you go to bed last night ?
Tom managed to finish his homework quickly .
I don &apos;t think anyone can help me anymore .
Tom often plays guitar with Mary .
Is this a good time to buy a house ?
Are you still in love with Tom ?
He &apos;s only a couple of years older than me .
I didn &apos;t say it like that .
Be yourself .
I &apos;m new .
How do I get out of here ?
I &apos;ll always take care of you .
I know Tom well .
Tom arrived in time .
He has some money in the bank .
I found somebody .
Which newspaper do you read ?
The children rarely go outside .
My room is very small .
How did you hear about that ?
We both know what &apos;ll happen if you do that .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
May I leave this book with you ?
We sure don &apos;t want that .
I didn &apos;t catch what he said .
Tom is going to do that for me .
Tom speaks a little French .
I &apos;ll go myself if I need to .
I heard Tom singing in the kitchen .
I wish I had a friend like you .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
I can swim very fast .
Tom took off his goggles .
I &apos;m very proud of our students .
I wish you had more time for me .
He seems ill .
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
Tom tries harder .
I didn &apos;t ask for these .
Let Tom stay .
Tom is going to enjoy this .
We have been married for three years .
You always make mistakes .
Do it for Tom .
No one takes me seriously .
Is that all you want to know ?
I don &apos;t think I understand you .
They plan to get married tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand what you want .
What is he up to ?
Tom kept me waiting .
He &apos;s helping me .
We &apos;ve seen him .
I &apos;ve paid you already .
It must be hard for you .
I want to know why you did that .
I &apos;ve been seen .
Tom is still there , waiting for you .
I couldn &apos;t get hold of him at his office .
Let &apos;s visit Tom .
I &apos;m going to tell you something about Tom that you might not want to hear .
Why don &apos;t I take Tom ?
I hate people like you .
It &apos;s very cold here .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen you around here before .
This is driving me crazy .
Is Tom drunk ?
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
Tom goes to bed early .
Your son is dating my daughter .
Our teacher likes his new car .
Tom , come here , I want you .
Tom thought I knew Mary .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
That includes everything .
Tom is doing fine in school .
Do you know his name ?
How long can you stay ?
Leave it where you found it .
Tell me your plan .
That &apos;s what I want .
Tom , I want to stay with you .
I &apos;m thirty years old .
That is her car .
He has a dog and six cats .
We &apos;re very sorry about that .
It didn &apos;t hurt at all .
I think we should leave Tom alone .
How many books do you think you &apos;ve read so far ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday next week .
I can &apos;t understand this business .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
I don &apos;t want you to be late .
I think his life is in danger .
That doesn &apos;t sound too hard .
Tom does want this , doesn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t know either of them .
Tell me how to solve the problem .
&quot; Where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I can &apos;t find him . &quot;
None of your business .
That &apos;ll just have to wait until next week .
I study English after dinner .
They &apos;re very old friends .
I already knew the truth .
We &apos;re not entirely sure what the problem is .
Why did Tom do this ?
All those things are true .
I wish I could help .
I disagree with you .
I bet Tom doesn &apos;t have any plans .
I read this in the newspaper .
Tom is looking good .
Tom is busy making breakfast for the family .
I &apos;ve heard all this before .
It would have been better if you had left it unsaid .
This is the house that he lives in .
Could you please be quiet ?
All of us speak French .
It might be important .
You look surprised .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
I &apos;m a man .
I often think about the place where I met you .
She is anxious about your health .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t early .
I &apos;m sure that Tom will be here soon .
I &apos;m not your mother .
Tom had a little money .
This is where I want to be .
Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
How many books do you think you have read so far ?
She reads after lunch .
I &apos;ve seen enough .
You always take things too seriously .
She is in need of help .
Tom is awake now .
I &apos;ll go wherever you want me to go .
You never should &apos;ve left your husband .
Tom found my bicycle .
Did you ever call Tom ?
Tom bumped into Mary .
Let &apos;s go by car .
What language is this ?
Let me have a try at it .
You haven &apos;t paid me yet .
I &apos;m not sure why I &apos;m here .
Let me handle this .
This river is beautiful .
&quot; I thought you liked him . &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
I have no family .
The boy ran away .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
Tom likes writing .
When was the last time I told you I loved you ?
What you say is right .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school today .
You &apos;re not happy , are you ?
I &apos;m going to be an uncle .
I have family in Boston .
Tom told Mary the truth .
I love Monday !
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can drive or not .
Give me the watch .
I look forward to meeting you .
How did you lose it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t deserve this .
Would you like to play with us ?
I &apos;ll be in the car .
Your secret &apos;s safe .
Tom never should &apos;ve let Mary out of his sight .
You have no other choice .
I like what you &apos;re doing .
You are completely right .
No one can understand your letter .
Are you taller than Tom ?
I thought you would say that .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
This is our house .
I don &apos;t want to think about what could &apos;ve happened .
I &apos;m not hungry right now .
This is not my home .
I am not like you .
I hope Tom likes me .
Open your eyes , Tom .
Tom and Mary got married when they were very young .
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
He plays the piano better than I do .
Tom is a good doctor .
Tom and Mary have what they want .
We speak French at home .
Tom had no idea where Mary went .
He turned out to be her father .
They can &apos;t get out .
I can tell this has been difficult for you .
Tom knew it was wrong to do what he did .
He has enough money .
Tom wasn &apos;t there last week .
I &apos;m still not talking to you .
Tom started that .
I can wait for you .
Tom is evil .
I guess I &apos;d better leave .
How can I help you ?
I couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
What kind of man are you ?
I had an accident .
You can &apos;t go .
I do not like the way he talks .
No one will be at home .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom about anything .
I was planning on telling you .
I can &apos;t drive .
Did you enjoy the movie ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary right now .
How &apos;s your mother ?
Tom and Mary are both college students .
Tom &apos;s here .
I can &apos;t go .
These glasses are beautiful .
Tom and Mary just bought a new car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
It &apos;s totally different .
Tom stayed silent .
We &apos;re not going to leave Mary alone with Tom , are we ?
What do you want to study ?
I &apos;ve still got work to do .
Tom and Mary were surprised by what they saw .
Tom will be able to swim soon .
I went to the airport by taxi .
He wanted to buy the book .
I know that it &apos;s there .
Tom is a very good friend of mine .
Tom &apos;s father comes home once in a while , but he never sticks around for long .
Tom eats anything .
The answer is simple .
It is too late .
I &apos;m concerned about Tom .
It &apos;s not entirely your fault .
He cannot afford it .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
Things don &apos;t always happen the way we intend .
What do we tell Tom ?
Do you know what has become of him ?
I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
You &apos;re way too late .
Let &apos;s have a go at it .
Nobody wants you to do this .
We can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about Mary .
She might come .
You have to sit down .
Do you know what time it is ?
We work together .
Why are we doing this ?
You are here because we need your help .
She said that she had been happy .
You should give up smoking .
Tell Tom why you &apos;re here .
Mary has beautiful eyes .
Tom was at school .
We &apos;ll take you home .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Where do you want me ?
I can &apos;t reach it .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand Tom .
I &apos;d like something to drink .
Has Tom ever told you how he met Mary ?
Tom &apos;s family is in Australia .
You ought not to say such a thing .
They &apos;re all good .
It won &apos;t take so long .
Where did that ship come from ?
I &apos;m not angry at you .
Who else knew about it ?
I can &apos;t tell yet .
I do want it .
I &apos;m not busy now .
I finally met Tom today .
He was satisfied with his new car .
I made this for Tom .
You know who they are .
Pay attention to what he says .
We &apos;re not leaving until we see Tom .
Tom is far better today than he was yesterday .
We &apos;re learning French .
I think you &apos;re right .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary is supposed to come .
He always keeps his promises .
I &apos;m not too tired .
Tom drove back to Boston .
Maybe Tom should &apos;ve stayed with the children .
Tom asked Mary a few questions that she wasn &apos;t able to answer .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday !
Everyone loves him .
When will you finish your work ?
Would you like to play with Tom ?
Nobody called Tom .
You still have a lot to learn .
I &apos;ll be careful .
If the car is gone , he can &apos;t be at the office .
Tom had difficulty learning French .
What else do you know about that ?
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
He will be very busy next month .
I was so happy .
We are brother and sister .
The movie hasn &apos;t started yet .
I didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
Tom has definitely studied French .
Tom is tipsy .
He thought that it would be interesting and fun .
He accepted her gift .
She began to talk to the dog .
This is no good .
We &apos;ll see what Tom has to say .
We can speak French .
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak English .
He wrote three books in three years .
I haven &apos;t told Tom anything .
I had no idea you were in here in Boston .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
We live in Boston .
It was very cold this morning .
Why is everyone looking at me ?
I feel like dancing .
What have you been doing all this while ?
Tom wants to learn French .
Where are we getting the money ?
You have to help us .
Tom bought a car last week .
He does this all the time .
All of us speak French .
How long do we stop here ?
You and I aren &apos;t like that .
I spoke to the principal himself .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
This book belongs to you .
Tom is rich , but not me .
This is a picture of Tom and me when we were three years old .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t around .
How many friends do you have ?
Where did you get your camera repaired ?
Not everyone could hear what Tom said .
How do you pronounce this ?
I &apos;ve got no friends .
Do you know what has become of him ?
Tom said he was from Australia .
I forgot his name .
It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn &apos;t come .
I can &apos;t speak English as well as he can .
How long have you been learning English ?
Tom asked me if I were happy .
Where can we buy it ?
I &apos;ll be waiting outside .
Tom didn &apos;t take the news very well .
You &apos;ve never been as busy as I am right now .
She watches television from four to six .
Who told Tom about Mary ?
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
I will go there even if it rains .
Why does Tom think that ?
Tom seems quite busy , doesn &apos;t he ?
We &apos;re not going to Boston .
How long &apos;ll that take ?
Can &apos;t we just be friends ?
We &apos;ll have to do it even if we don &apos;t want to .
I &apos;m not going to die .
Look , I know what I saw .
I hear you have jobs for us .
They are willing to talk about the problem .
When did you find out about it ?
Is your child a boy or a girl ?
I &apos;ve been reading that book all afternoon .
If only I could speak English !
Go to bed . It &apos;s a school night .
I am not too tired .
You &apos;d better go to bed at once .
I &apos;m glad Tom has gone .
What &apos;ll Tom say ?
Tom needs money .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
What does your son do ?
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
Is that all Tom told you ?
Have you already eaten lunch ?
Do you really think that &apos;s true ?
I don &apos;t know why you want me to do that .
Maybe Tom would be willing to help .
I want a picture of that dog .
Tom asked me to speak to you .
What did Tom do this time ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary .
Tom is rich , isn &apos;t he ?
He was not disappointed .
How big is your house ?
You can &apos;t leave yet .
When did you go to London ?
Tom lives somewhere around here .
I &apos;m not that happy .
Make sure Tom doesn &apos;t see you .
Is that not possible anymore ?
That &apos;s a good thing to have .
The light is off .
Tom was there .
Do you want to sleep on the couch ?
You &apos;re not satisfied , are you ?
Tom wasted no time .
Tom and Mary got married last month .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that with you .
When was the last time you went to the beach ?
Would you like me to ask Tom to do that ?
Are you afraid of a little girl ?
He made up his mind quickly .
Tom got back into his car .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
I can &apos;t do it by myself .
Don &apos;t you want to be rich ?
The dog seems sick .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
You can wait for me here .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home .
I wouldn &apos;t want to lose my job .
Tom is reading the newspaper .
This matter is extremely important to us .
Tom may eat wherever he wants to .
I &apos;m glad you made it .
You can &apos;t let that come between you and Tom .
You &apos;re doing it right .
You &apos;ll be happy again .
How much did you pay ?
My house is only five minutes &apos; walk from the station .
You don &apos;t need to go there if you don &apos;t want to .
Did Tom talk about it ?
School is over .
I gave Tom Mary &apos;s phone number .
I think Tom is tall .
I &apos;d like to work in Australia .
Why don &apos;t you come earlier ?
We &apos;ll help .
We had a lot of fun together .
What was inside ?
Here , this one &apos;s yours .
I think I should &apos;ve asked Tom to help .
Tom is a student .
My uncle comes to see me from time to time .
You made an error .
Tom is going to love being here .
That &apos;s not my opinion .
Are you sure Tom is happy ?
I would like to get a camera like this .
Is that your sister ?
What books have you read in English ?
You &apos;re going with me , aren &apos;t you ?
Is this your first time here ?
Can I count on you to do that ?
You are what you eat .
Tom knows nothing about Mary .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
Tom makes more money than Mary does .
He gets tired easily .
He made his parents happy .
We aren &apos;t going to do that .
Tom is the one who told me about it .
Tom says he has plenty of time .
That &apos;s what makes this so difficult .
I don &apos;t know how other people do it .
I &apos;ve learned a lot from Tom .
Stop saying that .
Tom is coming to Boston with us .
You &apos;re welcome to stay .
Tom had nothing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I want .
Tom &apos;s been so busy lately he doesn &apos;t know whether he &apos;s coming or going .
Please don &apos;t sit on that bench .
I hear Tom &apos;s voice .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure what to do .
Tom bought a very good camera .
Come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
The light went on .
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary .
What do you think they want ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to help us today .
I ate something I wished I hadn &apos;t eaten .
Have you heard whether Tom got the job ?
I want you guys to wait for me .
Do you have it with you ?
I &apos;ll go by car .
Tom doesn &apos;t think you &apos;d do that .
I have to open the window .
Where did Tom see you ?
Would you like to go with me ?
Tom was Mary &apos;s first love .
She has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom asked a very good question .
Here is your bag .
I have a lot of things to do .
That was so much fun .
I know Tom &apos;s phone number .
I study about two hours every day .
Tom had other things he wanted to buy .
He &apos;s done his homework .
You can wait for me here .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
Tom and Mary met in Boston three years ago .
I &apos;d like to apologize .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t like speaking French .
Count me in .
Tom has bad eyesight .
I &apos;m having lunch with my sister right now .
Where do they do that ?
This is how we do it .
Is your mother a good cook ?
Are you alone right now ?
Tom is a very fast swimmer .
I know where Tom did that .
You &apos;re standing in my way .
May I have a piece of it ?
I &apos;ll ask Tom to wait .
I &apos;m going on a run .
I need some bread and milk .
We all make mistakes .
May I come , too ?
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom and Mary each have a bicycle .
Come here . I want to show you something .
A girl phoned me .
I have to go to Australia next month .
She always keeps her word .
I won &apos;t be able to eat all that by myself .
He earns a good salary .
Tom walked home .
What book did you buy ?
Here &apos;s your lunch .
It &apos;s been three years since they got married .
I know why you want this job .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
I really don &apos;t feel like seeing Tom .
You can always rely on me .
Is this your cat ?
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that .
Why is Tom doing that ?
Tom looks like he always does .
Do you want to learn French ?
You don &apos;t have to answer those questions .
You need to go .
How long have they been here ?
I want to find Tom .
When did you go to work ?
He will visit his uncle .
Tom bought a dog .
Tom deserves the prize .
Tom didn &apos;t study at all .
Nobody knows how I feel .
What fun !
Tom shouldn &apos;t have done that .
When will you come back ?
How often do you come to Boston ?
I hope you don &apos;t mind walking .
Tom , we have a problem .
He won &apos;t live a long life .
How are you going to help Tom ?
I hate my job .
I &apos;m not interested in what Tom thinks .
We know this song .
There &apos;s a man here that wants to see you .
Where were you working last year ?
Do what you like .
Why were you eating by yourself ?
He likes to read books .
I thought I could count on you .
Tom will never love you .
What should I say ?
What more do you need ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Someone is playing the piano .
Did you guys hear that ?
Tom is one of my students .
Winter is coming .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m ready .
Tom sat on a bench reading a book .
I like your shirt .
I hope no one sees us .
How do they know ?
Hurry home .
Tom also has a daughter .
When will that occur ?
Did you call Tom ?
I &apos;ll remember you forever .
I will prosper .
Tom came yesterday .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
I can swim as well as you .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t eat meat .
Tom loves going out with his friends .
We &apos;re not going to give Tom the money he asked for .
You don &apos;t have a choice .
It is said that he knows the secret .
I think he takes after his father .
Do you know what day it is today ?
We want meat .
That &apos;s a good question .
Tom never told me about this .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as I am .
Tom did it , didn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve been to Boston a couple of times .
I want this one .
I think Tom is kind .
He drives very fast .
I don &apos;t want to get sick .
He ran .
Wait a sec .
I &apos;m the one who should be doing that .
I want to see you as soon as possible .
Our city is getting bigger and bigger .
Has everyone gone crazy ?
She is not my sister , she &apos;s my wife .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you until tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
She is a friend of mine .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
I &apos;m tied up now .
I finally was able to contact Tom .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
Tom waited for Mary .
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years .
I knew Tom couldn &apos;t have done this by himself .
Tell her to call me .
My bike was stolen yesterday .
How do you feel about what she said ?
My brother caught a big fish .
Tom could &apos;ve died .
It is about time you went to school .
It looks like we have everything .
This one &apos;s mine .
Tom and Mary used to often do that together .
I do not understand you .
Tom won &apos;t be here that long .
It &apos;s your fault .
Most boys know his name .
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve said .
I &apos;m really glad I did it .
This is your chance , Tom .
Tom , I want to go to sleep .
That &apos;s what I want most .
I have a big brother .
He gave me not just advice , but money as well .
Did you work yesterday ?
It &apos;s a good book .
It might be Tom .
I can &apos;t show you this .
I &apos;m getting hot .
I ate as little as possible .
You won .
Are you disappointed ?
Everyone has problems .
He lost his job .
This is too expensive .
I can hardly hear you .
Don &apos;t keep company with him .
I need more room .
That was really interesting .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
You are drunk !
I was surprised to see an old friend of mine there .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d like a cup of coffee .
You &apos;re absolutely wrong .
Tom is older than you think .
That &apos;s what I told him .
Today is my best friend &apos;s birthday .
I don &apos;t know what else I can say .
I don &apos;t believe I &apos;ve heard that name .
I have money .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;ll live .
You &apos;re too young to understand .
I was in the hospital for a week .
It &apos;s not true .
We should try harder .
How long is that going to take ?
I can explain it .
How often do you eat food you don &apos;t like ?
You must believe me .
Tom has a picture of his dog on his desk .
Tom is the one who told me how to do it .
Where are we exactly ?
I hate this .
Tom has to go to Boston .
I &apos;d like to know what you &apos;re doing .
Why don &apos;t you come over here ?
If you wish to speak to Tom , you &apos;ll need to wait about three hours .
This train stops at every station .
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
Is he tall ?
Tom saw Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything to her .
My head still hurts .
She is two years older than you .
Do you really want to go to Boston with me ?
I &apos;ll pay you .
Have you arrived at a decision yet ?
When will you come ?
Do you have money ?
He doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I should &apos;ve told you sooner .
I don &apos;t know anyone by that name .
It &apos;s too loud .
Which do you like better , tea or coffee ?
He &apos;s tall and handsome .
Did you go to London that day ?
What do you think of Boston ?
Why do they do this ?
Tom , Mary already has a boyfriend .
I wonder what it feels like to be rich .
I don &apos;t like him because he loses his temper easily .
We &apos;re just trying to help you .
I &apos;ll give you a ring tomorrow morning .
Can &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom hadn &apos;t done that ?
It &apos;s dangerous to play with fire .
I received your message yesterday .
They &apos;re coming again .
I &apos;ll give you this .
Tom was the last to arrive .
I don &apos;t hate children !
Maybe Tom shouldn &apos;t be here .
How did you come by all this money ?
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday .
It &apos;s cold out here .
I heard that Tom is sick .
Did you see the accident ?
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about a thing . Mary will take care of everything .
Tom looked again .
Somebody stole it from me .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
You made a good decision .
Why are you on this ship ?
I think Tom is getting ready .
Tom seems stupid .
I &apos;d rather stay here .
Tom is doing that the right way , isn &apos;t he ?
I know exactly where it is .
Everybody likes her .
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
How &apos;s your mother ?
He reads a good deal .
He has something to do with the matter .
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
I don &apos;t see a problem .
When did you go to London ?
You can &apos;t be too careful .
Tom is much better today than he was yesterday .
Tom sat on the couch .
I want to see your house .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Can I sit with you ?
He said that he didn &apos;t know .
Let me handle this .
Tom is probably alone in his room .
That sounds beautiful .
I just need more time with Tom .
When did you buy it ?
Isn &apos;t Tom with you ?
Why don &apos;t they like me ?
This is your last chance .
She helped the old man cross the road .
That &apos;ll put you in danger .
Tom likes to do that here .
Tom wrote a song about Mary .
The only one here who &apos;s able to do that is Tom .
My father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
It &apos;s about time .
Tom , are you awake ?
I was married once .
What &apos;s going on in this town ?
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to me .
I &apos;ve never seen you in a dress before .
This problem seems difficult .
You can speak French , can &apos;t you ?
Tom can &apos;t be over thirty .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Anyone can do it .
You look contented .
I love going to school here .
This book is very new .
He is in the kitchen .
You &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
Where are you , Tom ?
You may use my new car .
Tom told Mary to do that .
Don &apos;t give up on me .
The trouble is that it costs too much .
You are one of us .
I bought a book about animals .
Tom knows a lot about music .
My father bought me a camera for my birthday .
Can you make room for me ?
I &apos;m going to go find a doctor .
I know it was you .
Are you Tom &apos;s brother ?
I guess everybody thinks that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
You never say anything .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook this well , Tom .
They all look the same .
Mary is gracious to everyone .
It is just half past seven .
Tom saw Mary do that .
What you do is up to you .
We &apos;ll let you know .
We &apos;re not giving up .
I have a horse .
How many times has Tom been here ?
I lost everything I had .
I just want you to come .
Tom has a new girlfriend already .
I know your father .
Children often make mistakes .
Those who know him speak well of him .
I &apos;m not as stupid as you think I am .
That was very easy .
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary .
You &apos;ll be safe with him .
This is good , isn &apos;t it ?
I had no idea what to do .
Tom passed away three years ago .
She doesn &apos;t speak my language .
I don &apos;t know much about Australia .
Maybe we should blame Tom for what we did .
I could not sleep well last night , because it was so hot .
My father is always busy .
Tom looks awake .
Give me your book .
It won &apos;t be a problem .
That isn &apos;t safe .
Tom didn &apos;t want to marry Mary .
I saw her a week ago .
I already feel much better .
We &apos;re both fine .
I can &apos;t hear it .
You may choose whichever you want .
Why do I have to do that ?
She cannot have understood what you said .
Have you already tried not thinking of anything ?
He goes to work on foot every day except on rainy days .
Don &apos;t tell Tom .
Tom died almost instantly .
He was in good health last summer .
Have you finished writing the letter ?
I have no friends .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
No one will believe him .
Can you come for dinner tonight ?
She is five years old .
I saw Tom swimming across the river .
Tom saw Mary standing in the crowd .
Do you know what love is ?
Won &apos;t it keep until later ?
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
We can worry about the other problems later .
The man is right .
She pointed at him .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
Where should Tom go ?
What are your plans for today ?
We want our kids to be safe .
My uncle lives near the school .
We &apos;re OK .
It &apos;s hardly a secret .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too well .
I believe I was wrong .
Tom has it .
Why aren &apos;t they here ?
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary .
What would you do if you were in my place ?
Tom tried to leave .
I wish we could do this every day .
Tom became calm .
I don &apos;t know anybody here in this town .
Tom isn &apos;t invited .
I &apos;m not a child anymore .
His mother didn &apos;t want to do it .
Tom and Mary always speak to each other in French .
I &apos;m no quitter .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
I wonder if he will come .
It &apos;s you who doesn &apos;t understand .
Who asked you to help ?
This one &apos;s for you .
A promise is quickly forgotten .
Everyone I know has been there .
Tom is good at playing tennis .
I didn &apos;t have time to explain everything to Tom .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to like this .
I think Tom might like that .
What kind of music do you like ?
I &apos;ll be coming home .
Tom felt nervous .
This is Tom .
He wrote one letter .
Go back to your seat .
Tom said that he wanted to help .
Why are people scared of Tom ?
Maybe we should ask someone for directions .
She &apos;s not a doctor .
Is this Tom &apos;s bike ?
Tom laid the book aside and looked up .
You may as well tell me the truth .
Tom knows Boston well .
I know Tom likes me .
Is that something for me ?
Tom said to give you this .
I don &apos;t want to live with that .
I pointed at him .
That &apos;s what I told him .
Has Tom studied French ?
I don &apos;t like this .
They want to go home .
Why did he live in the United States ?
He was standing at the door .
Tom &apos;ll understand .
May I sit next to you ?
It turned out to be true .
He often drives to the library .
What did you eat for dinner last night ?
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
Tom took off his coat .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
He &apos;s rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom isn &apos;t safe .
I &apos;ll make it simple .
Would you prefer to speak in French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
This is my family .
How long does it take to go to the office from your home ?
We &apos;re not in Boston .
You can &apos;t mean that .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
Let &apos;s study English .
You don &apos;t have to tell that to your parents .
I want to speak to Tom .
I &apos;m not allowed to tell you .
When did the accident happen ?
I didn &apos;t hear it .
Tom looks like you .
I &apos;m going to leave school .
Have you read that book ?
Why aren &apos;t you home ?
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Tom loved me .
What have you got there in your pocket ?
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s Tom .
Tom is the one who told me that I should study French .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
She always cared about my health .
Tom isn &apos;t like that .
Tom can only get better .
There is a lot of money .
Give me another chance .
They &apos;re awake .
I &apos;m really happy for you .
Tom is planning to eat dinner with Mary tonight .
That &apos;s not how I want things to be .
It &apos;s my horse .
I know his family .
Tom gave us a lot of food .
All the students study English .
What are we doing here ?
He &apos;s better at the piano than I am .
Do you want to be my friend ?
I &apos;m very pleased to have met you .
Tom likes to do that .
Where &apos;s Tom ?
You don &apos;t want to do this .
You &apos;ve never had a girlfriend , have you ?
Everybody looked disappointed .
What have you eaten ?
Do you want to see more ?
This makes me happy .
Stop it .
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
I was glad to help .
Nobody saw me .
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
Tom moved towards the door .
I have the feeling that my French isn &apos;t getting much better .
What do you know about that ?
I think you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
I don &apos;t think I can do this alone .
They &apos;re expensive .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
Those are my books .
My mother always says she &apos;s going to visit me soon .
Would you tell me the time , please ?
Can I go now ?
I have money enough to buy it .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
I thought Tom told you about me .
It &apos;s very likely that it &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
Tom thinks Mary is beautiful .
Women don &apos;t usually want to talk with me .
This is where Tom and Mary live .
He loves me for who I am .
I don &apos;t know who you are .
What would you do in my place ?
It has to be true .
What is it you want to do ?
Do you know where he lives ?
She is proud of her daughter .
He looks like his grandfather .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
I was very happy .
It &apos;s almost time .
He can read and write .
You should go home .
I &apos;m worried about Tom being alone .
I &apos;d rather not sing that song .
How is your mother ?
Why were you absent yesterday ?
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
We want to know what happened to Tom .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
I &apos;m at the airport now .
Has anything like this ever happened to you before ?
Let me call Tom .
Is that Tom ?
Tom came back soon .
I hate dancing .
She quickly opened the letter .
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
He is very kind .
She was a great help to me .
Tom said this kind of thing happens all the time .
It &apos;s probably Tom .
He isn &apos;t young .
Let &apos;s speak in English .
Tom spends more than he earns .
Do you eat meat ?
I am a teacher , too .
You are children .
What is it you need ?
I want to hear you say it .
It &apos;s very hot , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s just not enough .
Please sit down on the sofa .
My opinion doesn &apos;t really matter .
I will get in touch with you next week .
I &apos;ve got a message for you .
I want to know all about you .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a brother .
Tom wasn &apos;t told why Mary wasn &apos;t there .
Don &apos;t say his name .
I don &apos;t want to eat lunch with Tom .
Why don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
You can &apos;t both be telling the truth .
Tom has one for you .
I think it &apos;s going to rain today .
I read the letter to him .
Where did you meet your girlfriend ?
Nobody died .
I don &apos;t feel like studying French today .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do that .
I didn &apos;t want to lose Tom .
That &apos;s quite a story .
What do you learn English for ?
I &apos;ve often wondered what it must be like to be rich .
What did you take a picture of ?
I think everything is ready .
How could I help you ?
The piano won &apos;t go through that door .
Father is still in bed .
I already have a girlfriend .
I will help you when I have finished my work .
We can &apos;t go .
Tom wanted to turn himself in .
What are you up to today ?
I wish I could remember his name .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
I couldn &apos;t call you . The telephone was out of order .
The decision &apos;s already been made .
She eats lunch here from time to time .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house .
Tom may not be as hungry as you think he is .
I &apos;ve never been this busy before .
You must be Tom &apos;s mother .
It &apos;s very cold this winter .
Tom had no one to talk to .
I hope that Mary passes the examination .
I was able to win the first prize .
You may take this .
Tom wants to go back to Boston .
Tom said he needed our help .
May I help you ?
We should study together .
I wanted to speak in French with Tom .
Where do you come from ?
Tom published a book about Australia .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to play with his kid .
I think we can help each other .
Life is crazy .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , is he ?
Tom went back to the table .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy everything we need .
We need to get to the bottom of this .
No one loves you like I do .
She can swim further than I can .
I could write a book .
I could do it again .
It doesn &apos;t matter when you come .
Give me a little money .
I knew there would be something to eat .
This doesn &apos;t mean a thing to me .
He spoke well of her son .
What makes you think I &apos;m rich ?
I &apos;m not sure .
Have you already decided what to do next Sunday ?
Tom has left us .
We have only three days .
Do you have any objection ?
I &apos;m sure Tom is OK .
That was the only thing Tom could do .
I have never met a person like him .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do it without you .
I speak French with Tom and Mary .
You shouldn &apos;t have told him such a thing .
You ought to wait for Tom .
Could you have done that ?
We do love it .
Regardless of what he does , he does it well .
I &apos;ll never ask Tom to help me again .
He &apos;s a good man .
I am tired of my work .
She could die .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
I remember them .
We are to meet again at the park tomorrow afternoon .
How long have you been in this country ?
You &apos;re never satisfied .
When did you go to bed last night ?
What is your name ?
I don &apos;t want you to go home .
That doesn &apos;t belong in here .
She may have missed the train .
I know what I &apos;d do .
I &apos;m not even sure I want to see that movie .
He and I are almost the same height .
Tom says he isn &apos;t happy .
I need a dictionary .
I know Tom pretty well .
You should have one of us do it .
How do you do that , Tom ?
You can &apos;t stay here .
I became very nervous when I couldn &apos;t locate my passport .
Tom wished he knew more than one language .
I have three children .
They &apos;re there .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll rain tonight .
What will you have to drink ?
Did you see your friends last week ?
She appears to have a lot of friends .
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like your new job .
I don &apos;t see what good that &apos;ll do .
I &apos;ve never seen you so nervous .
I &apos;ll get back to you on this .
It &apos;s one of the things that I like about you .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew French ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom in the car ?
I suppose you &apos;re hungry .
I want you to be ready when Tom gets here .
I want you to go to the doctor .
I think it was maybe Tom .
He went by bicycle .
How you &apos;ve grown !
What &apos;s the time ?
I often see Tom leave early .
What time is your bus ?
Be nice to others .
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
Almost all of us can speak French .
I just arrived .
I &apos;ve decided that I shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
Are you planning to help Tom ?
He sat on the bed .
We need a plan .
I told you Tom wouldn &apos;t want to go .
That &apos;s not possible .
I didn &apos;t understand your question .
I &apos;m just doing my job .
Maybe I left it on the table .
Are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
We don &apos;t need you .
I wonder if what I wrote was correct .
He &apos;s afraid of making mistakes .
All of my friends like Tom .
He likes taking walks .
Here &apos;s where the fun really begins .
Which is your bag ?
Thank you for telling me .
He &apos;s now studying .
Anybody home ?
Tom asked Mary how she was doing .
Tom didn &apos;t win .
We know Tom is here .
It wasn &apos;t easy for him to keep his promise .
He &apos;s always been kind to me .
I don &apos;t know where he went .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
There it is !
Tom doesn &apos;t live very far away .
I think of her day and night .
I can &apos;t do this without you , Tom .
I have to go .
I &apos;m taking my daughter to Boston with me .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
Tom is going to love this .
Tom started talking to himself .
Tom knows what Mary is doing .
Please come as soon as possible .
I thought I was going crazy .
We make a great team .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
I &apos;m always busy .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake myself .
Tom is running short of money .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
I &apos;ll cook for you .
We just finished .
Don &apos;t say things like that .
Give that to me , please .
I &apos;m having a hard time believing Tom didn &apos;t do that .
He may be on the next train .
What pretty flowers !
Why don &apos;t you ask me what you really want to know ?
Tom isn &apos;t worried .
I didn &apos;t know you could do this .
Tell me where you &apos;re going .
I &apos;m so happy you could make it .
Her brother is married , but he doesn &apos;t have children .
I forgot what I was about to say .
I enjoyed swimming in the river .
Tom brought Mary a drink and placed it in front of her .
There is no answer to your question .
You just don &apos;t know how it feels .
You &apos;ve earned it .
This dog is big .
Why can &apos;t Tom come ?
Tom is heavy .
Tell them the truth .
Tom wants you dead .
I don &apos;t have anything to read .
We haven &apos;t got all day .
How much is this worth ?
I never would &apos;ve thought that I &apos;d meet you here .
Why didn &apos;t you just ask ?
Tom and Mary want to tell us something .
I can &apos;t drive .
What would happen ?
We want a car .
How &apos;d you do it ?
I love them both .
Tom has nothing to do here .
That &apos;s the book I told you about .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I wonder if she is married .
Somebody called .
We need rain .
Who fell ?
Thanks for coming .
Tom is easygoing .
This month was kind of difficult .
Tom said Mary is good at French .
Maybe I can help .
Tom said that &apos;s fine with him .
I quickly tried to get advice from him .
I thought Tom might be sick .
That was stupid .
Tom will find out sooner or later .
I &apos;ll be back late tonight .
You will need a key .
He has a new woman in his life .
He asked me what was the matter with me .
I &apos;m not from Australia .
We &apos;re going to get you home .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Why is Tom looking at me ?
What should I buy ?
I had to make a choice .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
He didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
This really is something .
Tom believed Mary .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s quite true .
Why aren &apos;t you coming home ?
What do you want from me ?
You may swim .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
I &apos;d like you to come with us .
Tom and Mary were very quiet in the car .
Would you like me to carry your suitcase for you ?
This problem is too difficult for me to solve .
Did you ask your mother ?
You should do that right now .
Tom needs a job .
He works all night and he sleeps all day .
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Tom helped Mary yesterday afternoon .
She slapped him in the face .
I saw you .
No one likes it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think it was possible .
I have never done this before .
I just don &apos;t understand you anymore .
Your book is here .
It &apos;s going to take about three hours .
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
They know who you are .
You &apos;re always busy .
Why are you with me ?
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to speak to John .
Where did it happen ?
I think it &apos;s upside down .
You look content .
Tom said that he was very busy .
Where are we ?
Your plan is a good one , but mine is a better one .
Would you like some coffee ?
The old man lives by himself .
Do you believe in the power of love ?
Tell me what I need to do .
Tom has a lot of friends .
I like to learn ancient languages .
I think Tom knows where Mary lives .
They &apos;re there alone .
We can do without a television , can &apos;t we ?
You really know your stuff .
My parents don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom can &apos;t work .
The sky is clear .
I come to Boston quite a lot .
Tom knew .
Tom proceeded to the next question .
He &apos;s worried we &apos;ll lose the way .
I hardly understood anything at all .
It is not raining .
I don &apos;t speak French and neither does Tom .
Can he have said such a thing ?
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
Are you mad ?
You &apos;ve done a very good job .
Is that my hat ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary is .
I like fish more than meat .
This is very important to me .
They made fun of me .
The river was beautiful .
I don &apos;t eat that much .
You &apos;ve got a problem .
Tom put out the fire .
Here is your dog .
I hope not .
The car he &apos;s driving is not his .
That should be possible .
Leave it right where it is .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
My father bought a new car .
Tom is better at speaking French than the rest of us .
Life is interesting .
He is not a physician .
I didn &apos;t pay Tom anything .
I just want to go home and sleep .
As far as I know , he did nothing wrong .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
You can &apos;t tell anyone about this .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that Mary is in love with him .
All I think about is you .
Everything will turn out fine .
That &apos;s not the only reason .
It &apos;ll take you too long .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
Tom has one , too .
I love this school .
We expect that it will rain today .
She wants to buy a car , but she can &apos;t afford to .
I &apos;m taking the week off .
I &apos;ve got no choice .
Tom &apos;s French is very good .
I &apos;m going to do that again .
I knew you &apos;d ask Tom to do that .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
She took her own life .
I have a few friends in the United States .
I want to be happy , too .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do anything to help .
Tom makes big money .
Did you catch the first train ?
Tom isn &apos;t able to do his job anymore .
I do not have any money .
Tom works for a bank .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his dinner yet .
Be very careful .
I never heard you play it better .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to ever do that again .
I &apos;ve been looking for them for more than one hour .
I &apos;d like to be with Tom .
He &apos;s married and has three children .
Tom knows the man Mary came with .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
They were both drunk .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother .
I think Tom likes to do that .
It is up to you .
Please advise me on what to do .
A man is known by the company he keeps .
Is it there ?
It is too expensive .
He &apos;s not always happy .
&quot; I am a teacher . &quot; &quot; So am I. &quot;
Tom is old enough to drink .
I &apos;m having dinner now .
I &apos;m a lot taller than Tom is .
I don &apos;t care what you want .
You don &apos;t have to go with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t always come late .
He says that he has no memory of the evening .
We &apos;re not totally ready yet .
My wife &apos;s going to kill me .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
You &apos;ll never be alone .
He has been sick for a long time .
I just want this to never happen again .
I have plenty of time , but not enough money .
This isn &apos;t my money .
Tom doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Your answer is wrong .
Tom and Mary are going to get married .
I saw that , too .
I can sleep a lot better now .
Who &apos;s ready for more ?
I am disappointed that my friend is not here .
I have an opinion .
We haven &apos;t known each other long .
Many people in the world are hungry .
Tom won &apos;t get here until 2 : 30 .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
He arrived with me .
I worry about my future .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
Tom will win .
I want it .
What shall we eat tonight ?
You aren &apos;t going to tell my parents , are you ?
We are not speaking .
Tom seems to know the secret .
We found it .
Tom needs work .
I hear you &apos;re very rich .
What do you do here , Tom ?
Do you want to play with Tom ?
Tom wants more coffee .
It &apos;s quite large .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything at all .
Could you do it ?
I can &apos;t quite believe that .
Tom wants to go to Japan .
I &apos;m just as old as Tom .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;s coming .
Did you go to London that day ?
Tom found it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be in love .
It &apos;s one of mine .
I &apos;m happy for you two .
I like my coffee strong .
You didn &apos;t work hard enough .
Ask me anything !
I &apos;ll make you a drink .
I don &apos;t know anyone here , except for Tom .
Why are you still here ?
Tom gave it to us .
Tom is still there , waiting for you .
Tom plays the piano very well .
I &apos;m in bed .
He did not want her to leave .
I want you to come with me .
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is ?
I absolutely agree with you .
I don &apos;t know how they do it .
Tom must be hungry .
He was standing behind the door .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
I &apos;ve never seen anyone like you .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom is .
I don &apos;t mind .
Tom had to stay at home all week .
I must go right away .
I &apos;m going to go see Tom .
Do you have much money with you ?
Is everything OK at the office ?
The cat is looking at the fish .
Hasn &apos;t Tom started doing that yet ?
I want you to go there .
Tom looks busy today .
I think we should wait until Tom gets here .
He came .
What do you usually do on Sundays ?
She didn &apos;t want to get involved .
You go to school , don &apos;t you ?
He is older than you by eight years .
Tom really doesn &apos;t need the money .
I hope Tom never gets out of prison .
I &apos;m not happy .
Tom isn &apos;t wearing a shirt .
Tom sat down beside Mary on the bench .
I &apos;m now busy writing a book .
We should &apos;ve listened to you , Tom .
Tom put everything back where it belonged .
Tom took the knife away from Mary .
Is there somebody you want to talk to ?
It &apos;s nearly six o &apos;clock .
Tom and Mary are our best friends .
This boy is his brother .
Tom is rich enough to buy whatever he wants .
Everyone knows us .
That &apos;s for sure .
Tom didn &apos;t go to work all last week .
The boy I love doesn &apos;t love me .
I don &apos;t want Tom there .
Tom is short , but he &apos;s strong .
This room is not very large .
They say Tom can do that .
We got married very young .
I want you to come with me to see Tom .
I forgot my own birthday .
Tom is looking at me .
Why doesn &apos;t that surprise me ?
Get on with it .
All of us went except for him .
Are you sure about this ?
It turned out to be true .
I need to see you in my office .
I hope to see you tomorrow .
I learned it from him .
Tom is supposed to be in Boston .
I want you to tell me everything that happened .
It &apos;s not funny .
Tom walked past .
How good are you ?
Since he is old , this task must be difficult for him .
He &apos;s going to love this .
I went to sleep about 10 o &apos;clock .
Why are we doing this again ?
They were watching television .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here today ?
I &apos;m older than your brother .
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
Do you want me to go now ?
Did you ever call Tom ?
How &apos;s the weather there ?
Tom married Mary last year .
How long did Tom work here ?
I don &apos;t know what to do or what to say .
Do we have one ?
This is simple .
Tom punched her in the face .
It is impossible for me to answer the question .
You know that I like you .
I do not know anything about him .
It &apos;s very kind of you to help me with my homework .
No one came with me .
Tom has problems .
I still don &apos;t see it .
What &apos;s this room ?
I was in Australia all last month .
I like this cup .
You must do it this way .
I don &apos;t know how to swim either .
Yesterday was my birthday .
I &apos;d prefer to be left alone .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
Where did you buy the flowers ?
He wasn &apos;t there last week .
Tom said that &apos;s what he wants to do .
Tom wanted Mary to be his wife .
He dwells in the country .
Do it again , Tom .
Tom has children .
Please wait for five minutes .
You ought to know that .
I looked in the window .
Tom is right .
This book is full of mistakes .
What you said is true .
I must know the truth about Tom .
Tom and Mary are both happy .
I just don &apos;t want to be disappointed again .
It &apos;s a present for you .
What did Tom just say to you ?
This book is for you .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told me what to do .
He asked his teacher for advice .
This book is yours .
You &apos;re deceiving yourself .
There is a cat in the kitchen .
Vote for me !
We would like to buy a sofa .
When will he go home ?
I just have one question for you .
I let Tom drive my car .
How fast does this train run ?
Tom is studying French .
Tom understands me .
Tom made Mary go .
Did Tom , by any chance , let Mary drive the car ?
Your French is good enough .
The rain stopped and the sun came out .
Everybody knows for a fact that he is still alive .
That &apos;s how he likes it .
I know Tom is rich .
I was just talking to Tom .
I don &apos;t have time for boys .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Mary .
This desk , which I bought yesterday , is very big .
Are you going to be at this afternoon &apos;s meeting ?
This car is his .
The sun was hot and they were tired .
Tom loves to run .
I feel cold this morning .
The first was not the best .
Have you ever seen Tom do that before ?
Tom was not able to quit smoking .
We &apos;re about to go home .
What does Tom want us to do ?
Tom told me that he would help us .
Tom will try it .
What have you been doing recently ?
They all looked happy .
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
May I leave now ?
I think we have to make a decision .
Can I catch a taxi near here ?
I wish you &apos;d told me that a bit earlier .
My father never talked about the war .
Tom said that he feels much better today .
Please tell me the answer to the question .
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
We are afraid .
Nobody wants you to do this .
What if Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to do that ?
Somebody opened the door .
I have many books that I haven &apos;t read .
I &apos;m not getting this .
No one &apos;s going to find Tom .
He gave up .
I didn &apos;t want this to happen .
Monday &apos;s not good .
Eat with us .
How did it all come about ?
Here &apos;s the plan .
Tom seemed to know everyone .
The book is on the table .
She really needs your help .
Everyone says that he &apos;s a good man .
It &apos;s good to see you .
I found this in Tom &apos;s room .
I &apos;ve been to the bank .
Everybody loves him .
How often do you eat out ?
We are doomed .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
It was so simple .
I had fun doing this .
She gave me a present .
I &apos;m busy at the moment .
He knows what &apos;s going on .
Pay attention to what I say .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
Where &apos;s my wife ?
You will be safe with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Make the time to do it .
Do you do that often ?
How did you guys first meet each other ?
They &apos;re free .
Tom will like that .
I was just about to go to bed .
She is busy at present and can &apos;t speak to you .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
I don &apos;t understand you at all .
I wasn &apos;t kidding .
No one knows Tom is here .
This building is very large .
It &apos;s all going to be fine .
Is there something that you want ?
I was tempted .
What Tom did was very wrong .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
It &apos;s hot here .
Can you play the piano ?
We can &apos;t let Tom walk . Let &apos;s give him a ride .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here .
They attend every meeting .
The parents are playing a game with their children .
We ought to leave Tom alone .
He said that you had better go .
I liked everything .
I have to write a letter .
I &apos;m still angry .
Her name was spelled wrong .
Tom and I are mad at each other .
I was in bed already .
Can you drive a car ?
Did you forget ?
Tom isn &apos;t stopping .
I &apos;m not that old .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
I &apos;m only going to be here for three weeks .
What do you and Tom want to do ?
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
Aren &apos;t you from here ?
I need it by tomorrow .
Tom and I are old friends .
Tom and I want to study French .
I don &apos;t recognize any of these names .
You could have come to me .
Why do you permit it ?
You had better go to bed now .
He asked me to do it .
Tom isn &apos;t coming till tomorrow .
Tell Tom what to do .
That &apos;s what makes me happy .
That &apos;s what you told me .
If I had time , I could help you .
What are you getting out of this ?
&quot; Tom &apos;s death was an accident . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
I don &apos;t want to do his work for him .
I can speak to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come or not .
Life is too short .
Tom knows .
You have to speak French here .
I can &apos;t afford a new car .
You don &apos;t have to go to the party unless you want to .
I guess they really weren &apos;t all that busy .
She wants to buy her boyfriend a present .
Here &apos;s what I want to do .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like that .
Tom never showed up .
Tom and Mary are getting married next year .
I wish I had seen her .
Let me get right to the point .
I have nothing to do with the affair .
I didn &apos;t want milk .
Tom left before I arrived .
Tom won &apos;t leave .
I don &apos;t know where my keys are .
What &apos;s this about ?
Let &apos;s be friends .
We hardly see you anymore .
Tom is a psycho .
Do you have a plan ?
They believe you .
Tom helped Mary into the car .
If that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
Not all men are like that .
I bought you a present .
Everyone was there .
She pretended not to hear me .
Come back .
Tom , are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
Did you really talk to Tom ?
Are these your things ?
When did they leave ?
I have to be in Australia next Monday .
Children really do grow up quickly .
Did you say you had a cat ?
It has to be done .
It was very cold last month .
I don &apos;t want Tom &apos;s help .
Would you like me to explain it to you ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming home .
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
Tom told Mary that he wanted to eat .
Does Tom have a problem with that ?
What do you do when you don &apos;t have time to eat lunch ?
What are you guys up to ?
I &apos;m not interested in this .
Take my car .
I &apos;ve been misunderstood .
Tom isn &apos;t as fast as me .
She is always kind to everyone .
My daughter went to school .
Maybe it &apos;s Tom .
They &apos;re eating apples .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with him .
What did this Tom say ?
Go away !
It is dangerous to drink too much .
How come you don &apos;t know this ?
Tom needs something .
Tom came to Boston with me .
I knew what Tom meant .
Copy this , please .
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
Tom will find you .
Would you like to hang out at my place ?
I &apos;ve already forgotten Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name .
He just left .
Do you know why Tom isn &apos;t here ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom can hear Mary .
Tom knows Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I was worried about you all day .
The car bumped the tree .
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work .
Tom picked something up off the floor .
I don &apos;t think I like you .
Tom knows that Mary loves John .
Let us go home .
We went to Boston .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve never seen her .
You should call Tom .
Have you seen this man ?
They might tell us the truth .
I &apos;m not sure yet , but I think I &apos;ll become a teacher .
It looked like Tom wanted to say more , but he didn &apos;t .
Tom is now in jail .
I asked her to wait a moment .
You have no right to be here .
I went to the park this morning .
They might be taller than you .
Tom wants to take it .
Tom is the one that doesn &apos;t like me .
Let bygones be bygones .
I think he won &apos;t come .
Is that your car ?
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to be here .
Tom says it &apos;s hot .
Tom put on some music .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I didn &apos;t need to do that .
She turned off the lights .
Tom will be absent today .
I just have one question for you .
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
I don &apos;t know when Tom left .
He looked quite tired .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
I think you know what I want .
I want to stay for a few days .
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play .
I &apos;m not afraid of the future .
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can .
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
Where did you find that dress ?
It &apos;s already 7 o &apos;clock .
Promise me you won &apos;t tell Tom .
Tom always looked happy , but never was .
You should have listened to me .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that again .
No one knows what to say .
We &apos;re not going out .
He is taller than any other boy .
I &apos;ll be fine here .
Please come here .
There &apos;s a message for you .
I don &apos;t want your help .
I haven &apos;t understood anything that you &apos;ve said .
You can stay here as long as you like .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Tom now knows what he has to do .
Let &apos;s help Tom .
I &apos;ve always wanted to learn to cook like you .
Tom seemed afraid .
We &apos;ll do that .
Do you want to know who I am ?
This is theirs .
Tom said he had a gift for Mary .
This is my car .
I only know that Tom isn &apos;t happy .
Why is Tom running ?
Tom stole something from my house .
Tom &apos;s alive .
Do you want me to do that ?
Tom asked if I wanted to go to a party and I said yes .
What should I say to Tom ?
I can &apos;t contact Tom .
Tom is very sorry .
I just got here yesterday .
She was about to leave the house .
I &apos;m very sorry about this .
What am I here for ?
You look terrible .
Nobody wants you to do this .
We &apos;ll help you .
I &apos;ll take your word for it .
My mother is not always at home .
No one has seen Tom for years .
I have my passport .
It would be better for you to stay in bed today .
Your friend is here .
I don &apos;t know who you are .
Tom has been single all his life .
If that happens again , I &apos;ll leave .
I saw him enter the room .
Do you know Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
Where did you learn this ?
Do you have a moment ?
You must keep your room tidy .
Tom wrote down Mary &apos;s phone number .
She loves cats .
I think you &apos;re ready .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will like this idea .
I &apos;ve got to know .
I have nothing to tell you at this moment .
How long will you have to wait ?
Tom and Mary were there , too .
How about a cup of coffee ?
What are you still doing here ?
We &apos;ll wait a while .
This will pass .
This book is hers .
He can be proud of his father .
We &apos;ve known each other for more than thirty years .
Tom almost never says anything .
He will be back in ten minutes .
You can &apos;t leave yet .
Tom didn &apos;t read the book .
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
It looks good to me .
There &apos;s no reason for you to do that .
What are you getting out of this ?
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom is dating Mary .
Let &apos;s take a train .
Can you do that again ?
I don &apos;t hate you .
You &apos;re welcome to wait .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
If I &apos;d wanted to go , I would &apos;ve said so .
I did that right away .
What do you like the most about Tom ?
There was nobody in the garden .
Tom doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
Tom had a lightbulb moment .
You &apos;ve never been married , have you ?
You know where everything is .
They don &apos;t get it .
You can read French , can &apos;t you ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along very well .
Tom isn &apos;t nice .
What do you think this is ?
They love this song .
I &apos;ll say no more .
I just received your letter .
When did you buy it ?
Would you like some ?
Tom isn &apos;t paying us anything .
He writes beautifully .
You may read this book .
There are many people who don &apos;t speak French .
Tom found it .
How much snow have you had ?
What , may I ask , is so important ?
You asked for our help .
How are you coming ?
I &apos;m coming , too .
Can you give me a hand with this table ?
She helped him .
It &apos;s a lot of work .
Can you stay for dinner ?
Tom walked through the door .
He is going to be a father soon .
You can lean on me .
I think you &apos;re doing that wrong .
Release Tom .
I do not like music .
I could learn something from you , I think .
It never existed .
Tom is the one I want to go to Boston with .
I don &apos;t have what I want .
You &apos;re invited .
Don &apos;t you want to help ?
It is impossible for me to help you .
I &apos;m sure Tom told you .
Tell Tom that we &apos;re leaving .
Tom would be able to do that .
Can you come back later ?
This is a present for you ?
Tom was fatally injured .
I hope Tom is alive .
You have to believe in something .
They know who you are .
Perhaps I will never see you again .
Tom isn &apos;t the kind of person who blames others for his mistakes .
I feel happy when I &apos;m with you .
What kind of game is this ?
He asked a very good question .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , but Mary is .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
Let go of me !
Tom does love you .
Are we alone ?
I have to have it .
Mary has flowers in her hair .
Tom loves cats .
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
Come on , Tom . It &apos;ll be fun .
Tom said no one else was there .
Finally , I found a job .
I haven &apos;t worked for years .
I didn &apos;t want to cook .
Who did you learn French from ?
Do you have anything further to say ?
I don &apos;t know what his name is .
Tom is in the prime of his life .
We know that and they know that .
I cannot help you .
You have to listen to Tom .
What is in the desk ?
I want to know how you did it .
What are they going to do ?
He wants to marry my daughter .
Tom has no idea why Mary did that .
I don &apos;t really know .
This isn &apos;t about Tom , is it ?
It won &apos;t stop raining .
He asked me whether she was coming .
What is it you &apos;d like to know ?
We now live in Boston .
I don &apos;t like this type of house .
It is next to impossible .
Tom told me you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
When I grow up , I want to be just like you .
You &apos;re not watching .
I met Tom on my way to the theater .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
Let &apos;s begin .
Tom doesn &apos;t want that .
Is Tom right ?
Do it at once .
We know what we want .
What are you doing tonight ?
You can &apos;t go home now .
What I &apos;m saying is true .
I don &apos;t have a present for Tom yet .
Is this your bicycle ?
Tom wasn &apos;t quiet .
I &apos;ll be free .
Tom died alone .
Do you want to eat anything ?
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here .
I &apos;m at the airport right now .
I can &apos;t remember anymore .
No one knows where Tom has gone .
I would like to go , too .
Tom says I have to study French .
Please tell me how to get to the airport .
I finished work at six .
She went with him to Boston .
Are you still angry with me ?
Do you want to go for a swim ?
Tom swims every other day .
I &apos;m not in Boston .
How did you do it without our help ?
They are very old .
Promise me you won &apos;t go .
I hate people like you .
You have to stay in bed until next Monday .
Tom is at home now .
You &apos;ll have to come here .
Let &apos;s discuss your idea .
Take the dog for a walk .
You &apos;re a good student .
I don &apos;t know whether I can do it , but I &apos;ll try .
I have eyes .
I have a question .
Tom bought this house thirty years ago .
I just want to go home .
I &apos;ve come all the way from Boston .
I think that everybody knows .
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s doing OK .
Do you want to see her very much ?
This car is good .
Tom is very young .
Tom is watching TV .
We prefer to stay here .
Tom did this .
I want a glass .
I could hear everything .
Tom read a book .
Tom is likely to be dead .
Do as he tells you .
It wasn &apos;t Tom who left the water running .
Tom realized that he couldn &apos;t play tennis as well as Mary .
Family is family .
I &apos;m very hungry today .
Look what we have here .
Tom and Mary are about the same height .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
How old is your cat ?
Today isn &apos;t really convenient for me .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I bought a book .
It wasn &apos;t possible for the boy to swim across the river .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
Tom was mad .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Tom got into the car and slammed the door shut .
I have to leave now .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
I didn &apos;t look at Tom .
I can &apos;t remember anymore .
It &apos;s just what I needed .
It &apos;s easy .
The man stood up .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
When I &apos;m with you , I &apos;m happy .
Let me call Tom .
Tom wrote a letter to himself .
That bicycle belongs to our school .
Let &apos;s go to the beach .
Tom will come tomorrow .
I don &apos;t understand why you want to do that .
It could be important .
I admit this may not be the best way of doing it .
Tom drove to school .
Tom slammed the door behind him .
I can &apos;t give those to you .
I &apos;m not going to work with you today .
Where are you heading ?
You don &apos;t look too good .
I &apos;ll never be able to play again .
Tom has the day off .
Most people like watching TV .
Tom wants to see that .
Please give me a cup of coffee .
I &apos;d already thought of that .
I don &apos;t think there is a doctor here .
Playing with fire is dangerous .
Tom certainly got the message .
Tom didn &apos;t know he &apos;d hurt anybody .
Tom has worked hard .
I know nothing about it .
Tom &apos;s family is here .
The party was almost over .
This is one of mine .
He made it for his sister .
This computer is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
She came back in about thirty minutes .
How long ago did you start studying French ?
What &apos;s Tom going to say about this ?
Why are you still here ?
Have another .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
All Tom does is eat .
That has something to do with this problem .
Tom has just arrived .
Don &apos;t repeat that .
He lives from hand to mouth .
I &apos;m not here .
Tom ate a lot more than I expected .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really Tom .
I may never see you again .
I know him very well .
Look me up sometime .
Are we sure about that ?
You seem busy .
Tom and Mary were in the garden .
She sat next to me .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that .
Do you play tennis ?
I remember her face , but I don &apos;t remember her name .
You &apos;re not rich , are you ?
I &apos;ll show you the way .
Love me , love my dog .
Tom can win .
Did you use to live here ?
What do you think ?
I missed the last train .
Tom likes tea .
Why would I tell you ?
I think I can fix this .
Tom had to go there by himself .
I love you and I will always love you .
I gave you a book .
How long has Tom studied French ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has a dog .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
It won &apos;t just happen overnight .
Tom may do whatever he likes .
I think you know that .
Didn &apos;t you use to work at a hospital ?
I was just here yesterday .
We haven &apos;t made a decision yet .
Tom said he thought that it could happen in Boston , too .
What you &apos;ve heard about me isn &apos;t true .
Let &apos;s get a cab .
What is your decision ?
I just wanted to be sure .
Tom talked to Mary yesterday .
Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
Tom is just like you .
I wonder why .
Nobody called .
I had no idea what I should write .
He learns fast .
Tom might be able to help me .
What were Tom and Mary thinking ?
Why is life so difficult ?
What do you do when you don &apos;t have time to eat lunch ?
This is my book .
Tom rides a bike to work .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
She wants him .
I wonder why Tom needs that .
She put on a coat .
Can you imagine what life would be like without television ?
Tom wrote me a letter .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows exactly how that happened .
Are you going to be at this afternoon &apos;s meeting ?
Tom became sleepy .
I stayed in Boston for three years .
That &apos;s not how you spell my name .
I already knew this .
Everything is OK .
Is the job too much for you ?
I &apos;m still busy .
What were you doing at Tom &apos;s house ?
Nobody listens .
If you don &apos;t go , I won &apos;t , either .
That &apos;s exactly what I mean .
Who are you there with ?
I &apos;ll come as often as possible .
So what are you implying ?
Tom wants to go to Boston .
Tom needs to stay where he is .
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom plans to be there .
Do you want to eat ?
It &apos;s not your fault .
Why do you think that is ?
I can &apos;t remember .
I was away for a year .
Tom was the first one to leave .
I gave one to Tom , too .
He acknowledged his fault .
He &apos;s mad at everyone .
Why don &apos;t you go and have a look ?
Do you remember when Tom said that ?
What &apos;s Tom good at doing ?
Where is your homework ?
Tom asked Mary to meet him at John &apos;s house at 2 : 30 .
Tom said he &apos;d be able to help us do that tomorrow afternoon .
When &apos;s Tom getting here ?
I hope it works .
Tom wasn &apos;t stupid enough to tell Mary what he really thought .
Tom doesn &apos;t care what people think about him .
How do you want me to do that ?
I &apos;m very proud of you .
I &apos;ve known Tom since we were both kids .
I &apos;m in love with Tom .
Tom went back home .
Tom is waiting for Mary &apos;s reply .
Tom is going to love you .
Tom made me eat it .
Tom seems to be angry .
Open your mouth wide .
Did you telephone him ?
Tom wasn &apos;t the only person who couldn &apos;t do that .
These keys are not mine .
I have to take it .
We think you &apos;re doing very well here .
I will come to your party this evening .
There is a television in my room .
Tom took some things out of his bag .
Is this your book ?
When did you find this ?
Could you do that tomorrow ?
That &apos;s just the way things were back then .
He lives with his mother .
We are at home today .
I feel strong .
He was sick last week .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
Why does this surprise you ?
We &apos;ll find that out soon enough .
This is my office .
I will be taking the exam about this time tomorrow .
I know why Tom is doing that .
May I try it ?
You &apos;d better go .
Tom is a good friend of Mary &apos;s .
They won &apos;t make it .
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
I want to live in a small town .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
I have the same number of books as he has .
Tom &apos;s birthday was yesterday .
I know the problem .
How would you say it ?
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
Please give me a piece of bread .
They &apos;ll love that .
It &apos;s definitely a bad idea .
Everybody left .
It &apos;s too big .
Do you want to have some coffee ?
How about some music ?
I don &apos;t want you to do that , Tom .
Please tell me what I &apos;m doing wrong .
Tom won &apos;t change .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with .
I had nothing else to say .
You know this is a mistake .
Don &apos;t ask me that again .
Tom is busy right now .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants .
I can &apos;t believe you did this by yourself .
Tom walked into the room .
Give me some advice .
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
Tom sat behind his desk .
I can &apos;t remember where I bought it .
I thought Tom was going to do that .
I heard something .
Please say something .
His house isn &apos;t far from this store .
Tom wanted to succeed .
Tom comes to school by bus and train .
I told Tom not to use those .
I don &apos;t like that name .
It &apos;s my fault , not yours .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
It was a mistake .
She went on speaking .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
We &apos;ve already done our work .
I remember it all .
I wish I could swim .
It &apos;s interesting .
I know someone who speaks French well .
I must get the television fixed .
I &apos;ve never met anybody like you .
I hope Tom won &apos;t be too disappointed .
Tom took Mary and her daughter home .
Who wrote the letter ?
I thought you &apos;d decided against it .
Have they gone ?
Tom will tell us .
This makes me think of you .
Why didn &apos;t you let me know ?
Tom might &apos;ve been the one who did this , but I don &apos;t think so .
She called him .
Where is your room ?
Tom is too young to drink .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
They were very kind to me .
I like dogs and my sister likes cats .
School was fun today .
I &apos;ll do what Tom says .
Why did Tom start studying French ?
He &apos;s old enough to be her father .
I met your friend .
Tom and I get along fairly well .
I &apos;m not your boyfriend .
I am in the classroom .
How old were you when you learned to write your name ?
We &apos;re anxious about your health .
You are late . The meeting finished thirty minutes ago .
This isn &apos;t for me .
Tom appears nervous .
They are all very busy .
What &apos;s in your suitcase ?
Tom has to come .
Tom isn &apos;t a child anymore .
Tom almost won .
I &apos;m in the car .
Tom got upset and left .
Tom isn &apos;t capable of doing it .
This book is hers .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
I felt sorry for Tom .
Tom won &apos;t lose .
They &apos;re dancing .
Tom is coming to the party , too .
I &apos;m not your girlfriend .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
I will stay .
I almost feel sorry for you .
Nobody could &apos;ve known that this was going to happen .
I didn &apos;t write this letter .
We &apos;re not doing that again .
Your watch is ten minutes slow .
I hope Tom stays in Boston .
I think that girl &apos;s name is Mary .
It &apos;s just too soon .
I &apos;m not afraid any more .
Why didn &apos;t I see that ?
You &apos;re never satisfied .
I know what you want to do .
Thanks for the milk .
Have you read this book already ?
You have to stay awake .
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat lunch today .
You sure look handsome today , Tom .
Tom wished he had a dog .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
We found it here .
I &apos;ve always wanted to study French .
What &apos;s it like being Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary about what had happened .
Are we all ready ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there alone .
Who made this cake ?
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
I want my money returned immediately .
Tom didn &apos;t know how long the meeting would last .
Can we swim here ?
Why did you call ?
When will you get married ?
I &apos;d like to know why .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve kept you waiting so long .
Let us know if you &apos;re coming .
I &apos;m not feeling too well .
I &apos;ll never do it again .
I &apos;m new in town .
I know you don &apos;t like Tom .
She has lived with us since last summer .
He is alone .
Tom is out walking his dog .
Tom wanted you to know .
You can &apos;t see me , can you ?
It &apos;s been ages since we last met .
He is studying at his desk .
Tom talks to Mary a lot .
He left the room .
Did Tom speak French to you ?
I want to know about Tom .
No one helped me .
He &apos;s ten years older than you .
Tom called you .
Is it October already ?
Do you know how old I am ?
I &apos;m not going to be there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
I don &apos;t like him .
The guy playing the piano is Tom .
I &apos;m already rich .
You &apos;ve got to help me .
Tom helped himself .
Tom and I &apos;ll meet you there .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
I called you this afternoon .
There &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
It is difficult for me to answer the question .
Stop singing .
Tom helped me a lot with that .
I said yes immediately .
We don &apos;t have to be here .
We would die without air .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
Don &apos;t blame Tom .
The movie theater was filled with people .
I want to know where you &apos;re going .
I &apos;m not ready yet .
Is that all you want to say ?
This isn &apos;t a place for kids .
This is from Australia .
He is taking a day off today .
Tom can &apos;t picture himself as a teacher .
You &apos;re back again .
This is the house in which he was born .
I &apos;ll take him .
Tom knows hardly anything about it .
Tom looks young , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom had expected something quite different .
I had to stay home .
Tom needed help .
I used to live there .
Tom didn &apos;t know this .
He has no girlfriend .
I took Tom to the hospital .
Tom can &apos;t have done it by himself .
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know .
I &apos;m giving it to you .
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that because he doesn &apos;t think he needs to .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary had already done that .
She knows she does not have any other choices .
I only found out about that a few days ago .
I can run .
I &apos;ve lived in Boston for a little over three years .
You cannot imagine how happy she was .
Why do I have to talk to Tom ?
Tom made Mary do the work .
Some kids are playing in the park .
I hope you &apos;re hungry .
He was never to see his wife and family again .
Tom isn &apos;t particularly bothered about what other people think of him .
My time is running out .
Tom and Mary both work eight hours a day .
They seldom , if ever , speak in French .
Tom took Mary with him .
I hope to hear from you soon .
My telephone doesn &apos;t work .
No one seems to have any idea where Tom is .
Tom was furious .
Tom never gave up .
Do you know where ?
I met an old friend of mine .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
We &apos;ll see each other tomorrow in the library .
Kids don &apos;t read books anymore .
Aren &apos;t you going to introduce us ?
I believe that everything will be okay .
He cannot have done it by himself .
You can &apos;t do two things at once .
Tom could &apos;ve gone .
He will win the first prize .
It is pretty cold .
Tom did do that .
I won &apos;t be long .
Isn &apos;t that what they want ?
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me ?
I &apos;m going to go find Tom .
He is a teacher at our school .
Tom knows not to do that .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
Get a doctor in here .
My mother is always busy .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
Let &apos;s get married .
I want to see my parents .
Tom gave up .
She is very proud of her daughter .
Tom looked through the small window in the door .
I would like to tell you something .
Tom wouldn &apos;t mind .
If you need my advice , I &apos;d be glad to give it to you .
Why do they want me ?
I am through with my work .
That &apos;s not a good thing .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
We can get what we want without your help .
Tom seems to be very happy to be here .
You remind me of your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened .
Tom came early .
I &apos;d like to study in Boston .
Wait , why are you here ?
I haven &apos;t eaten since breakfast and I &apos;m very hungry .
You are my friend .
I can &apos;t imagine why .
Thank you for remembering my birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s not done yet .
I don &apos;t really know why .
Has the movie started yet ?
I heard him sing a song .
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow .
I like fish better than meat .
When do you need it ?
Who can speak French better , Tom or Mary ?
I wonder if Tom is intoxicated .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it on time .
You said it yourself .
I wish I could talk about it .
Tom will be very pleased .
I &apos;ll go tell Tom we &apos;re ready .
Tom is very calm .
Tom doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
We &apos;ve arrived .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
What do you people do ?
Tom introduced me to all his friends .
I can &apos;t remember who I gave it to .
Tom sometimes visits me .
My French isn &apos;t that good .
Tom wore a new coat to school today .
Tom can read .
Tom asked for more money .
Can anything else be done ?
I think it &apos;ll rain today .
There is no telling what he is thinking .
My mother died when I was a kid .
Has the world gone mad ?
Children should be allowed to be children .
How much is that all together ?
Tom has many friends .
It &apos;s been three days .
Tom told me you were with my son when he died .
You were always too busy to talk to me .
What my mother had said was true .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
I gave you my word .
All Tom can think about is Mary .
You need to go .
It &apos;s out of the question !
All of them speak French .
You know what you have to do .
We were a little tired .
I know how I am .
We &apos;re all right .
Tom has never been abroad .
I can &apos;t ever be what you were .
That &apos;s about it .
How was your afternoon ?
I think that we should forget about this .
I would like to have a cup of coffee .
Is Tom here ?
I eat only what I want to eat .
You need me more than I need you .
He seldom , if ever , comes .
I went to school here .
Tom can &apos;t explain it .
What have you told them ?
Tom still loves Mary .
Tom &apos;ll change .
Have you ever gone to work on Sunday ?
There &apos;s nothing I want to say to you .
How did you achieve that ?
I can afford it .
Are you all by yourself ?
You will stay at home .
Do you have any further questions ?
This isn &apos;t a game .
Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning .
How did you come by such a job ?
Come home at once .
You should stop that .
Have you talked to Tom about this ?
I don &apos;t remember what I wanted .
What &apos;ll this accomplish ?
Tom wanted Mary to know .
Be nice to her .
May I start eating now ?
I &apos;ll be back at seven o &apos;clock .
Tom fell asleep while reading the newspaper .
I must get back to my work .
I would like something to drink .
She always gets up early .
I believe Tom can do that .
Don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did today .
We regard the situation as serious .
Tom thought no one was at home .
Do you know how to do it ?
I &apos;m afraid I won &apos;t be able to have lunch with you today .
How do you do that ?
That &apos;s our fault .
Is everything alright here ?
There &apos;s nobody here by that name .
He asked for more money .
Tom has been told not to talk to Mary .
I &apos;m not free .
What does Tom want to know ?
I can handle it myself .
She speaks loudly .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
What is it you want to know ?
Tom got very concerned .
I don &apos;t care what you say . It &apos;s not going to happen !
My cat is sleeping on my bed .
They are all very happy .
I think that you &apos;re right .
She is working night and day .
Tom works .
What do you enjoy doing ?
If you tell Tom what to do , I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do it .
We &apos;re going to make it .
I &apos;ve spoken in French with Tom many times .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
That sounds funny to me .
What &apos;s Tom done ?
You can &apos;t help me .
Have you ever stolen anything ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
Why did you ask ?
We &apos;re parents .
Tom still wants to come .
I have a girlfriend back home .
He can &apos;t be ill .
The store was not a big one , was it ?
I &apos;m dreading the exam .
Yesterday I had my bicycle stolen .
Why are you so busy today ?
I saw a plane .
Are you still thinking of going to college ?
When did Tom start studying French ?
Tom isn &apos;t that young .
That was fast .
We love Tom .
I think you &apos;re stupid .
Is Tom still awake ?
This coffee is too hot for me to drink .
You &apos;re not very happy , are you ?
Everybody is very busy .
Tom wanted to buy a new car .
Tom appeared busy .
They &apos;re after me .
What do you think of this work ?
Tom is avoiding me .
Please stop playing with your hat .
I bought a good camera .
I only look like Tom . I &apos;m not Tom .
Tom needs you .
I need some time .
I don &apos;t like your dog .
We know it &apos;s not about that .
Do you think she still loves me ?
This is a hospital .
I don &apos;t want to harm you .
We are students .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
I wanted more .
I regarded him as the best doctor in town .
Tom seemed quite pleased with himself .
Tom will turn thirty in October .
It began raining just now .
That &apos;s what I thought .
I didn &apos;t get the job .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
We have things to do .
I don &apos;t say it without reason .
I do wish we could finish today .
I hope we &apos;ll find lots of it .
Tom didn &apos;t even want to go to the park .
We &apos;ve found it .
&quot; What are you thinking about ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about you . &quot;
I don &apos;t care what you do .
Tom couldn &apos;t run very fast .
Tom helps anybody who asks him for help .
I got married .
I &apos;ll never be your friend .
Are you still mad ?
Who did you learn it from ?
How did you make it ?
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2 : 30 .
Tom said that he lost his key .
I know what they &apos;re like .
Tom asked us to help him .
Tom said it was out of the question .
Have you called the boss already ?
My dog died last winter .
I may have to go to Boston .
I &apos;ve learned a lot .
Where is your sister ?
Tom knows what he wants to see .
I worked a lot today .
Tom stood in line .
Can you give me this one , please ?
I think you &apos;re going to like it .
Tom isn &apos;t thinking about that .
I &apos;ll be back at ten .
His sister looks young .
No one &apos;s going to see us .
Tom can fix anything .
Come on , Tom . Let &apos;s go home .
I sat behind a very tall man in the theater .
Tom told Mary he loved Alice .
I &apos;m glad that you asked Tom for advice .
Why do we have to do this ?
One cup of coffee , please .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
Tom is difficult .
I &apos;m glad you like our house .
I &apos;ve never been so tired .
You haven &apos;t seen Tom , have you ?
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
Tom became very sick .
Don &apos;t be sorry .
What are we to do ?
Tom thinks he knows why .
This coat is nice , but too expensive .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me what I want to know .
We must never do this again .
We should do this every Monday .
She tried her best to help him .
I don &apos;t know her at all .
We used to talk about our future .
Did Tom give you that ?
The teacher stood before the class .
Tom is coming here .
I know what people want .
That &apos;s what Tom thinks .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have written that .
Tom was scared .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go to bed .
Tom isn &apos;t nuts .
Tom has three kids now .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
The train is very fast .
Tom would do that .
I don &apos;t remember anything about it .
You &apos;re strong .
Tom seems very interested .
This has got to stop .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
Tom wants to come with us .
Tom made dinner .
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
We know everything you know .
Tom seated himself .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
Tom put his clothes back on .
I &apos;m ready when you are .
My name is Tom , and this is Mary .
We &apos;ll come together .
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
What would you like to drink ?
Come on ! We &apos;re going to be late .
Did they say why ?
Do your parents know about this ?
There &apos;s lots of rain all year .
He visits us now and then .
No one is listening to me .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
She must be angry with me .
I &apos;d still like to have coffee with you .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
Isn &apos;t that why we &apos;re here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
How did you hear about that ?
You must do it .
You can &apos;t leave us , Tom .
Do you plan to buy that car ?
I &apos;m going out for a drink .
We went to Australia together three years ago .
We don &apos;t even know each other .
My uncle bought me this book .
You can go wherever you want to go .
Tom is already waiting .
Tom took a day off .
Do you think you can do this alone ?
Is it really that simple ?
Give them to her .
I was crazy to do that .
They already got married .
Tom &apos;s in heaven now .
We &apos;re always very careful .
Why is Tom sleeping ?
We know they &apos;ll come .
What does this have to do with my future ?
How good was Tom today ?
He kept me waiting for a long time .
I was asked to do this .
What do you think is going to happen ?
He did not eat anything yesterday .
You surprised everybody .
Tom finally believes us .
You can have it .
Tom and Mary want a big family .
I &apos;d do it .
Where is today &apos;s paper ?
If anyone can fix this , it &apos;s Tom .
He made a mistake .
He ran as fast as he could .
This car is easy to handle .
We can do it right now .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom wants to see his son .
Everyone &apos;s watching Tom .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t a student anymore .
I really don &apos;t want to do that .
I love my wife .
Tom almost never goes to Boston .
Tom is trying to learn French .
I &apos;ll go there on Monday , too .
Can you stay for dinner ?
Where &apos;s it from ?
Tom is three years older than you .
I &apos;m not going to open this .
Why don &apos;t you and Tom do it ?
It &apos;s going to take about an hour .
What are you up to today ?
I should have taken the money .
English is not difficult to learn .
Tom didn &apos;t say who he &apos;d gone with .
Tom and I enjoy talking with each other .
Tom could &apos;ve said something , but he didn &apos;t .
Tom seems to be much taller than he used to be .
How did he come here ?
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
You must never forget that .
Please take good care of yourself .
I don &apos;t recall saying that .
I already said I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Why &apos;s Tom always here ?
Please tell me what &apos;s wrong , Tom .
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
We found one .
Tom is studying in his room .
I don &apos;t like anything .
We didn &apos;t talk long .
I know exactly where it is .
The problem is difficult to solve .
Tom has said he has to do that .
How did you learn to dance so well ?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary ?
She called the students into the room .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Where does Tom go to school ?
Do you want something to drink ?
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
I only wish to help .
You had better tell me now .
I don &apos;t like that word .
No one will ever find you .
You must never forget that .
I worked on it day after day .
Tom spoke French to me .
He &apos;s my brother .
If you &apos;re not quiet , I &apos;m going to ask you to leave .
We need to know .
Thanks for the cake .
Tom died three hours after Mary died .
Who are you and what are you doing here ?
I don &apos;t know why everyone &apos;s so tired .
He saw everything .
I want nothing to do with it .
How did you first meet Tom ?
I don &apos;t even know where Tom lives .
Tom doesn &apos;t belong here .
What &apos;s going on out here ?
I hope that he will help me .
If that happens again , I &apos;ll leave .
Ask me anything you want .
Is this your letter ?
Something &apos;s not right .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
I don &apos;t like beer .
I &apos;m a doctor .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
I &apos;m not stopping .
You have a lot of books .
I can &apos;t live on my own .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
I don &apos;t know who he is .
Tom is going to be with Mary .
Is that important ?
We have a lot to do .
I want us to be friends again .
My bicycle was stolen .
Tom arrived yesterday .
My brother plays the guitar .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
That belongs to my brother .
This one &apos;s for you , Tom .
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
Give us some space .
Tom gave me the key .
Go back to your room .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
Tom may not want to go .
This is a better house than the other one .
Nobody likes Tom .
They know who you are .
I wish I had enough money to buy a new bicycle .
That &apos;s part of it .
Tom thinks Mary knows .
Don &apos;t be too sure .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
It &apos;s all very simple .
None of us want that .
Tom and Mary understood each other .
She stopped smoking .
Tom left for home well over an hour ago .
I &apos;m happy to have you here , Tom .
Because he was tired , he went to bed early .
I asked Tom to give me a second chance .
How do you know there isn &apos;t one ?
This isn &apos;t working .
How far away is the airport ?
You &apos;re hurting me .
You &apos;re going to like working for me .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
I &apos;m late , aren &apos;t I ?
I arrived too early .
We &apos;ll be living in Boston .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
Should we try it ?
Tom was a good father .
She speaks clearly enough to be easily understood .
Tom will be happy to show you the way .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I haven &apos;t heard that word in a long time .
My sister isn &apos;t a good cook , and neither am I .
I think you worry too much , Tom .
How did you get Tom to do that for you ?
I like their house .
Tom didn &apos;t seem surprised .
We &apos;ll be there in less than three hours .
I need to get to this meeting now .
I have bad eyesight .
Don &apos;t talk like that .
Why are we going to Boston ?
Tom stopped .
She gave us a present .
I mean it !
She &apos;s way taller than me .
I still do that .
I don &apos;t like that kind of music .
Tom was real happy .
I can &apos;t explain what happened .
I &apos;d like to ask a question .
Life is tough .
Where is Tom anyway ?
You &apos;re not going to sleep , are you ?
Tom has what he wants .
I like it when Tom does that .
There is a bank in front of the station .
I &apos;m fed up with homework .
No one here knows anything .
I &apos;m taking a walk in a park .
Tom is no longer in jail .
They are more or less the same size .
Tom believes you .
Tom had questions .
I mean what I &apos;m saying .
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
I also wanted to know .
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
I think we &apos;d better wait for another thirty minutes .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know any French .
Can I help you with that ?
I know that you know .
That &apos;s my brother .
I &apos;m tired of losing .
He &apos;ll answer your letter soon .
Tom and I hardly ever see each other anymore .
Tom knew nothing .
My mother looks young for her age .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
You have to stop .
I think they like me .
I read your letter to my family .
I &apos;m not going home .
No way !
I bought my sister a new hat .
I feel very ill .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind .
What &apos;s this street called ?
Do you know when Tom &apos;s birthday is ?
I &apos;d rather not go to Boston with Tom .
I can &apos;t really remember .
Come soon .
All three of us were at Tom &apos;s party .
I &apos;m just lucky .
I wonder who &apos;s going to be at the party .
She didn &apos;t have much money .
Why does this surprise you ?
I bought it for ten dollars .
Tom can &apos;t possibly do that by himself .
Why didn &apos;t you call me last night ?
We don &apos;t know where Tom is .
I have bad eyesight .
I love you more than you love me .
Isn &apos;t there anyone else who can help you ?
After dinner , I take a walk on the beach .
Tom told me that he was hungry .
I bought a few eggs and a little milk .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
Isn &apos;t his name Tom ?
We all felt sorry for Tom .
What makes you think I want this ?
That was very funny .
October is over .
Everything seemed OK .
We &apos;ll all go together .
I &apos;ve never done this before .
They live there .
Tom is facing up to thirty years in prison .
This telephone is out of order .
It &apos;s too big .
I &apos;m sorry if I hurt your feelings .
Tom arrived in Boston less than three weeks ago .
What &apos;re you doing about this ?
Tom is going to do fine .
Do you think you can do better ?
I felt lonely .
We &apos;re here .
I think about Tom every day .
Tom has Monday off .
He looked very tired .
Tom now understands what has happened .
You know who I am .
I hope you &apos;re enjoying yourselves .
I think I &apos;ll be back in about 30 minutes .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
I have wine .
I &apos;d like to know more about it .
Isn &apos;t that Tom &apos;s hat ?
Set Tom free .
It was the only way .
I do not fear death .
I just want to be with you .
I &apos;m still your boss .
Where shall we meet ?
Tom said you would come .
I &apos;m very tired and I want to go to bed early .
I &apos;ll give you a ride home .
I hate my parents .
Tom slept in the car .
You have to believe in something .
I &apos;ve only been there once .
Tom works for Mary &apos;s father .
I learned a lot from Tom .
I knew what needed to be done .
What can you give me ?
You don &apos;t need that .
Tom is wearing a hat .
Tom wasn &apos;t safe .
I didn &apos;t expect you to get here so soon .
She &apos;s two years older than you .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at all .
Tom has a family now .
We rarely go out .
The boy remained silent .
You didn &apos;t need to take a taxi .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I don &apos;t know anybody here , except for Tom .
Tom was already doing that when I got here .
I &apos;m going out in an hour .
You &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
Do you want me to drive ?
The coffee is hot .
We understand each other .
That &apos;ll be fine .
I have to stop this .
Do you know if Tom can speak French ?
You won &apos;t get there on time .
I didn &apos;t eat anything .
I &apos;m not sure why .
I want to see the movie .
I want one !
Are you happy with your life ?
He is unable to do it .
It is very kind of you to show me the way .
I know that Tom is a doctor .
I ran as fast as I could .
The TV doesn &apos;t work .
Would you like to go for a swim with me ?
I knew you &apos;d come after me .
Tom and Mary are still there .
I was able to swim across the river .
You could &apos;ve said something .
She asked several question of us .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
There &apos;s a party after work .
Tom knows we &apos;re coming .
Tom and Mary are getting married soon .
It was from Tom .
You act surprised . What did you expect ?
I love tea .
It &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .
I should go to Boston .
Tom lives in the city .
Give me my money back .
She comes from a good family .
The light went out .
Tom was different .
I wouldn &apos;t do that for all the money in the world .
What would you like ?
Tom has been expecting Mary .
I wonder if you might be able to help me .
I want to know who started it .
I may not do that .
Where are the boys ?
Tom had no problem doing it .
Be kind to others .
Have you eaten dinner yet ?
Have you had lunch ?
I want to watch this .
I figured you might want this .
This is a question for Tom .
What a country !
He told me not to drive too fast .
Don &apos;t admit anything .
Tom can &apos;t even write his own name .
We saw them leave .
It &apos;s not what you think .
He can &apos;t stay long .
I know that he was busy .
Thank you for calling .
They look like us .
Tom will try .
I have to say this .
He always keeps his word .
&quot; What time is it now ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ten o &apos;clock . &quot;
I said we aren &apos;t going to do it .
This is the first time I &apos;ve heard that word .
Women had little choice in the past .
I couldn &apos;t wait .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston last week .
It &apos;s yours if you want it .
I &apos;m up .
Do you really want to know what I think ?
You &apos;d better not stay up too late .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t have time .
If you won &apos;t tell Tom , I will .
What are you two doing here ?
We &apos;re not busy .
She always looked happy , but never was .
She might come .
What do you want to do with your life ?
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning .
Tom was in the kitchen helping his mother .
Tom said goodnight to Mary .
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
I don &apos;t know how Tom finds the time .
What are you wearing ?
How come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
We &apos;re here , too .
Tom is loud .
Tom is exactly the same age as me .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he could do that .
Tom knows where you are .
Can you give me some money ?
You &apos;ll never be alone again .
Tom seems pretty happy .
Tom was here less than an hour ago .
How did you come up with such a good idea ?
What &apos;s Tom eating ?
It &apos;s not a problem .
Tom wants me to take Mary to the party .
Dog is man &apos;s best friend .
I want to help you with your homework .
Tom is in the car .
I don &apos;t really remember all that much about what happened .
Do you have enough food ?
I hurt the same way you hurt .
Tom drives too fast .
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here .
I &apos;m really proud of you .
Take care of the kids for me .
I have to do something .
This book is mine .
It was an easy decision .
Tom will always be here for you .
I &apos;m a high school student .
We all know Tom .
Tom can understand you .
I &apos;ve fallen in love with you .
It &apos;s fine with me .
You run .
I know the situation is very difficult for us .
What Tom said wasn &apos;t true .
That we are not able to do .
I think Tom knows things that we don &apos;t .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
I was hardly able to see it .
Tom isn &apos;t that crazy .
I want to know where you heard that .
Why don &apos;t we take Tom there ?
Don &apos;t give me a thing .
Tom won &apos;t be going to school next week .
We are watching TV .
Tom was there yesterday .
You may do whatever you want to .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be able to solve this problem by ourselves .
What &apos;s their plan ?
My mother gets up earlier than anyone else .
She did not read the book .
Tom had other things he needed to buy .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary driving his car .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand Mary .
Tom &apos;s impossible .
Tom &apos;s father died before Tom was born .
Tom is also studying French .
That &apos;s interesting , but beside the point .
Look after yourself .
She didn &apos;t go yesterday .
Tom kept me waiting for three hours .
Tom often comes late .
Tom had his palm read .
Tom sat alone .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
What is it like in Boston ?
Tom is writing a new book .
Someone else might want your old desk if you don &apos;t want it anymore .
I dislike Tom .
There &apos;s no reason to do that .
Tom can &apos;t drive .
As I told you earlier , I can &apos;t help you .
I &apos;m a long way from home .
My father gets up early .
I &apos;m not so good at tennis .
I don &apos;t remember exactly .
Tell me more .
Your French is hard to understand .
What are they doing out there ?
I know everything now .
You &apos;re used to that , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d really rather not eat that .
I want to be as happy as Tom .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
You found me where no one else was looking .
Tom &apos;ll stay .
I &apos;ve never seen you cook . Can you cook anything at all ?
Thanks for nothing , Tom .
May I try it ?
Tom can understand Mary &apos;s French .
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
I &apos;m at home almost every night .
I assume you &apos;re getting paid for this .
How is the weather today ?
Do you have any apples ?
He worked hard .
It was yesterday that I saw him .
No one lives here .
Tom is just going to need some time .
What did you do in Boston ?
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
Please feel free to ask questions .
It is not easy to be understood by everybody .
He will never make it .
You should phone your mother as soon as you can .
What you say is right .
It was rather funny .
We made it .
Tom loves what he does .
It &apos;s good to talk to you .
Tom said he was glad that he did that .
This book isn &apos;t mine .
He doesn &apos;t live far away .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
We &apos;re getting tired .
No one knows what has happened to him .
May I have this book ?
Tom can go wherever he likes .
It was quite simple .
Tom enjoyed it .
He is rich enough to buy that car .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember .
Tom could &apos;ve figured that out without Mary &apos;s help .
I have to get a new computer .
Tom helped Mary carry her suitcases .
Tom slept for a few hours .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
You should take a vacation .
I &apos;ll never do that again .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
Tom knows how to do that .
I may not have time .
Do you know how that could &apos;ve happened ?
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
Could you repeat that , please ?
Please come here soon if you don &apos;t mind .
I &apos;m better than him .
Are you certain it was an accident ?
Tom fell .
Tom and Mary played together almost all day .
Tom is no longer my friend .
I think we should visit Boston .
Promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
They are very big apples .
I can &apos;t find Tom . Has he gone already ?
We &apos;re just trying to help you .
You have to let me help you .
You aren &apos;t from around here , are you ?
Tom never saw Mary again .
Tom was there with one of his friends .
We don &apos;t know whether to believe Tom or not .
He has never been late for school .
Who wants to know ?
What do Tom and Mary look like ?
Tom had no food .
He was stupid enough to believe her .
Do you think Tom saw us ?
What does this have to do with my family ?
What are you doing ?
Thank you for doing this , Tom .
I can &apos;t wait to meet you all .
Tom is in Australia , but Mary isn &apos;t .
He has been sick in bed for a week .
I knew you &apos;d find me .
That &apos;s what I told her .
I want to live with you .
We can &apos;t go back there .
It may be all right .
Tom began to learn French .
I just wanted to make you proud .
Tom told me he was really hungry .
Tom may not want to do that .
When did he come here ?
We &apos;re not finished yet .
Did you get Tom &apos;s message ?
I had a good opinion of her .
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
Tom wasn &apos;t hurt .
I wrote it for Tom .
I don &apos;t really know why , but they don &apos;t like me .
We &apos;ve run out of beer .
Did you find another picture ?
There &apos;s nothing there .
How does he go to school ?
It &apos;s not easy to understand his ideas .
I will never forget the day when I first met him .
She got the money from him .
It is on me .
How many eggs are there in the kitchen ?
Tom sat next to Mary on the bus .
Is it white ?
He may have read the letter .
I &apos;m not sure if I like this one or that one .
People don &apos;t like what they can &apos;t understand .
The message is written in French .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
You are to do your homework before supper .
We visited Tom .
I would like to help you .
There &apos;s something here that Tom should see .
Tom is probably rich .
I want a beer .
Tom will be back from Australia next Monday .
Tom has left town .
I know Tom has been hurt .
This is very important to us .
Does anyone oppose the new plan ?
I don &apos;t feel like doing anything today .
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
You don &apos;t like music .
I want you to stay on the beach .
Tom probably died .
I &apos;ve lost my friends .
He &apos;s not sick .
Are you with us , Tom ?
People like my mom .
Does Tom have a girlfriend ?
I don &apos;t care what happens .
Do you want to sit down for a few minutes ?
We &apos;re going back to Boston .
My mother has made me what I am today .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
Please shut the door .
He called her every other day .
I have one in the car .
I don &apos;t care what Tom has done .
My wife looked surprised .
It &apos;s still raining .
I can &apos;t help .
I don &apos;t want to go to jail .
Are you able to swim ?
I love you more than I love her .
I &apos;d like to ask a few more questions .
Tom and Mary just got married .
Tom likes that one .
Could you drive Tom home ?
You should have done it earlier . It cannot be helped now .
Do you know where Tom works ?
Tom was surprised to hear Mary had gotten married .
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve .
The decision is ours to make .
Who knows what you saw ?
It &apos;s very small .
It isn &apos;t likely that she will come .
Do I look presentable ?
We require your help .
Tom and Mary know each other .
I don &apos;t want to have anything to do with that .
That &apos;s how we do it .
She could not believe what she saw .
Tell me what you see .
Tom did well .
I don &apos;t know anything about him at all .
It &apos;s already late .
What &apos;s wrong with that ?
I don &apos;t have much time .
I don &apos;t remember her name .
They will die .
Tom didn &apos;t see anybody .
You are safe here .
That &apos;s the way it works .
They arrived too soon .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at French .
I &apos;m going to go home .
My children don &apos;t speak French .
Tom can &apos;t come , because he &apos;s sick .
This is where Tom wants to live .
Tom didn &apos;t do any work .
I will have to change my ways .
I really thought Tom was happy .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t love each other anymore .
He showed her the way .
Is Tom with you ?
The teacher made fun of Tom .
He hasn &apos;t been able to come because he is sick .
I need some of your time .
They have to go to school .
Tom picked up the book and started reading .
She has her faults , but I like her .
Tom is almost never busy anymore .
Open your eyes , please .
Have you read Tom &apos;s new book ?
I knew you &apos;d like it .
I put some milk in my coffee .
She carried that table by herself .
Perhaps it &apos;s Tom .
You can do whatever you want to .
That &apos;s what works .
How do you like this town ?
Tom won &apos;t help .
Let Tom stay .
This is all wrong .
You can use this car .
What have you been up to lately ?
It &apos;s time to put the children to bed .
Could you please help me ?
He won &apos;t live much longer .
Tom speaks very good French .
I &apos;m more afraid of them than I am of you .
Tom got bigger .
Tom has more than enough money to buy a car .
Tom stayed home .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
She says that she wants me to come with her .
It &apos;s about time .
It &apos;s OK with me if it &apos;s OK with you .
I hear you loud and clear .
You don &apos;t miss a thing , do you ?
I began the book .
No one understands me .
Tom wants to study in Boston .
How do you know I don &apos;t know ?
The family ate dinner together .
It &apos;s not so bad here .
Tom isn &apos;t happy to be here .
The party is just getting started .
You don &apos;t have to help .
We can &apos;t find Tom .
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
Tom said he was tired and wanted to go home early .
Why don &apos;t you all come with me ?
Tom and Mary have three children .
My daughter is still at work .
Tom needed more .
It &apos;s never that simple .
You must do as I say .
I have visited the place time after time .
I think you should think about the future .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom is good at speaking French .
So why don &apos;t you tell Tom that ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom got very wealthy .
I &apos;m not asking Tom .
Why do you want to go ?
Ask Tom to wait till I come .
Tom thought it was a good idea .
What &apos;s it like ?
I &apos;ve bought a car .
I &apos;d love to visit Boston .
They arrived before you .
We don &apos;t need you .
There are still people who don &apos;t know how to read .
This clock is out of order .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
She wouldn &apos;t speak to him .
That &apos;s a good price .
I don &apos;t need them anymore .
That &apos;s my dress .
Tom wants to read a book .
Tom wants to know how long we &apos;re going to be here .
Those dogs are big .
The bus stopped , but nobody got off .
Here is your dog .
Many people do this .
This is impossible .
You can easily find the bank .
You could drive home by yourself .
She may have been beautiful when she was young .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I had no notion that you were coming .
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary does .
Tom won &apos;t know .
I thought you said your car was stolen .
They grew angry .
It &apos;s not always easy .
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
Why are you doing that ?
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I &apos;ll be there in about 30 minutes .
I need to see it now .
Are you with us , Tom ?
I think they saw me .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that kind of thing to him .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve got this little job I want you to do .
You can &apos;t imagine it , can you ?
Does he have many books ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary will say yes .
Tom doesn &apos;t usually do things like that .
You &apos;ve gotten better .
I have homework to do .
It &apos;s too difficult for me .
How hot is it ?
I don &apos;t like your friends at all .
If I can understand it , anyone can .
Tom left quickly .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
I said I &apos;m sorry .
See you tomorrow .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ve done some things I &apos;m not proud of .
How old do you think Tom is ?
How did you do that without our help ?
I was sleeping .
Tom spends too much time working .
Tom is still angry .
Men should work .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t know French .
Why didn &apos;t you visit Boston ?
Tom may eat whenever he wants to .
I don &apos;t need you to remind me of anything . I know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
You think I don &apos;t know who you are , don &apos;t you ?
He came at me with a knife in his hand .
I was thinking about buying a new camera .
Tom is listening .
I won &apos;t talk to you .
What am I going to do now ?
I don &apos;t have any plans for tonight .
Tom came to see you yesterday .
I think that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;d do .
Tom still writes to me from time to time .
Tom sat on the bench next to Mary .
What kind of dog is that ?
Don &apos;t get nervous .
I was scared of Tom .
Tom looks hungry .
Is the baby able to walk ?
They love their children .
I love kids .
Tom finished reading the book and returned it to Mary .
Did you really say that ?
I don &apos;t like it when people keep me waiting .
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
You &apos;re too good for me .
Tom asked Mary to open the window .
Everybody &apos;s happy .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
I can &apos;t walk .
You are free to go home .
How is that possible ?
I don &apos;t want to lose you , Tom .
He kept his promise .
I think I &apos;m a good teacher .
I &apos;m giving it to Tom .
Is that all Tom told you ?
If it were not for water , we could not live .
Can we try this again ?
It &apos;s not worth the effort .
Do you know how to get home ?
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t very hungry .
Are those for me ?
The reason I &apos;m here is because I was asked to come .
The tea is hot .
There is a letter for you .
See you in October .
Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
Tom was working .
This movie is worth watching .
We really had nothing to lose .
I was slightly surprised .
Do you want a glass of water ?
Tom is writing to a friend .
I need air .
They are looking to you for help .
Did you enjoy the movie ?
You should eat something .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
It &apos;s a dictionary .
I can see why Tom likes Mary .
Where have you been lately ?
She &apos;s helping me .
Don &apos;t make fun of them .
Tom was there for me .
I will stay at home .
He &apos;s ready to go .
This was my mistake .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you soon .
What are you guys up to ?
Do you want another one of these ?
Have you ever heard someone speaking French ?
Are you in Australia ?
Is your school far from here ?
There will always be things we &apos;ll never understand .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to apologize . He did nothing wrong .
Thank you for calling .
Where was Tom born ?
Tom walked Mary to the door and she left .
I hope it rains .
Why are you acting this way ?
I will do anything for him .
I wish I had more money .
What do you need ?
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
You &apos;re going to be a father .
Everybody likes you .
Who is going to speak tonight ?
I didn &apos;t forget you .
Tom and Mary got married very young .
My mother is beautiful .
When have you ever done anything for me ?
Mary told me that she was glad to see me .
You &apos;re good at what you do .
Perhaps that would be possible .
Tom made that himself .
They are leaving Japan tomorrow .
Tom is here with us .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t know . What do you think ?
I saw her swim .
If you don &apos;t want to do it for Tom , then do it for me .
I don &apos;t need it .
That &apos;s up to Tom .
He &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
We should go inside the house .
She made him a new coat .
It appears to me that you are right .
Your dog is here .
I love you more and more each day .
I &apos;m just about done .
The men are eating lunch .
Tom is the father of three children .
We have to tell them .
I think Tom should do that .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
I &apos;ll be back in a jiffy .
I want you to tell Tom that you don &apos;t love him anymore .
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Why don &apos;t you go home early today ?
I saw Tom and his dog in the park .
You &apos;re winning .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that you knew each other ?
Something must be done !
I think I know what Tom is doing .
Let &apos;s try to understand one another .
I just had to ask Tom that question .
I might go swimming today .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
I &apos;m worried for you .
Tom has so much money that he doesn &apos;t know what to do with it .
I should &apos;ve chosen the money .
Where did you get this beautiful dress ?
Please wait five minutes .
Tom thinks he knows where Mary went .
Is this your cat ?
I &apos;m very glad to be here .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
Someone stole Tom &apos;s bicycle .
Get your hands off of Tom .
Our first lesson today is English .
Are you here alone ?
Can I eat in my room ?
Did you call me up last night ?
I &apos;d love to know that .
Did you live here ?
That &apos;s the house where I used to live .
Let &apos;s walk .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
Tom seems intoxicated .
I forgot your phone number .
Let &apos;s see if Tom is in his office .
Where did Tom see you ?
Tom won &apos;t be able to do that that soon .
This is what he said .
I must buy a pair of shoes .
Tom comes here every day .
I like music very much .
I &apos;m giving it back .
Dinner &apos;s getting cold .
I just don &apos;t believe it .
Tom is my daughter &apos;s best friend .
Can I ask why ?
You can find somebody else to help you .
Did you say something ?
Tom needs your help to do it .
I think Tom will like this .
There was no one on the beach .
Why don &apos;t you drop in ?
I tried for almost an hour .
Tom has a good reason for avoiding Mary .
I don &apos;t speak French as often as I used to .
Tom won &apos;t have to wait very long .
There are many people living in this house .
We don &apos;t want to lose you .
Do you even know where the school is ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
I want a family .
They swim very quickly .
You should know it .
Is the job too much for you ?
He &apos;s a teacher and so am I .
You &apos;re welcome to write to me .
Tom &apos;ll help .
He was seriously injured in a traffic accident .
Tom removed the key from the door .
I don &apos;t think this is for you .
I &apos;m taking this one .
Tom wants way too much money .
Are you tired ?
I &apos;m very worried about you .
You can &apos;t wear those clothes to work .
I took a day off .
Tom sat down beside Mary .
What did Tom have to eat ?
Tom can &apos;t write very well .
What &apos;s happened to the money ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
It &apos;ll have to wait .
Tom took the bus to school .
This is a newspaper .
Tom and Mary love each other .
I really thought Tom liked me .
What else did you do there ?
You don &apos;t have a choice .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
School &apos;s out .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
I &apos;m very surprised that Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom and I are kind of busy right now .
I &apos;m never late for school .
We still want to help you .
This is his house .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
What is it you do again ?
Do you want to leave now ?
That doesn &apos;t interest me .
I &apos;d like to see my son .
I don &apos;t like that one .
Are you for or against my plan ?
Would you like to know how I did that ?
We &apos;re coming with you , Tom .
Are you ready to talk about it ?
I think Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
She hardly ate anything .
If you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll ask someone else to help me .
I no longer need it .
Everyone is drunk .
How do you like your new car ?
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
This is how I mastered English .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
It was rather easy for them .
Why is Tom in Boston ?
I would like to see your mother .
Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom anything .
How did you hit on that ?
What kind of books do you like ?
You aren &apos;t rich , are you ?
What does your sister do now ?
I arrived on Monday .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid to speak French .
He did what I wanted right away .
Are you from the bank ?
We drove to Boston last Monday .
Tom can speak French a little .
I need to ask you something .
How come this never happens to me ?
If I had enough money , I could buy it .
I think that I have a right to know what &apos;s going on here .
Hold on there .
I &apos;ll be leaving now .
I wonder why you would say that .
What do you think about it ?
Tom can &apos;t do this as well as I can .
Tom was married to Mary &apos;s sister .
I know Tom better than anyone else does .
No one knows the reason .
Tom needs Mary .
How much money have you got ?
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
What &apos;re you doing in my house ?
Tom has to walk to school every morning .
I remember how angry you made me .
Tom often appears on TV .
The building that I saw was very large .
What else could it be ?
See you tonight .
Where were you an hour ago ?
Tom got a new job .
We &apos;re here for the day .
I &apos;ve never heard my mother sing a song .
I went there yesterday .
Tom felt safe .
I have some friends in Australia .
My brother speaks very fast .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be early .
Tom said that he couldn &apos;t wait anymore .
I need someone to hold me .
He didn &apos;t know what to say .
Please go on with your story .
They have families .
They are both good .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
Tom will never make it .
Tom certainly didn &apos;t seem to be expecting us .
Tom has been playing games with Mary all afternoon .
This is a story about a cat .
Do you want me to go away ?
I can &apos;t tell you what Tom told me .
I didn &apos;t mean it .
Tom will call you later .
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t talk with you .
I &apos;ll do this .
What does Tom want Mary to do ?
Tom can run as fast as Mary .
Tom gave Mary something she needed .
Don &apos;t look up .
Tom isn &apos;t scared anymore .
If you eat so much , you &apos;ll get sick .
What do you want ?
They didn &apos;t find Tom .
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary .
Tom and Mary went outside .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
Tom is coming .
Did you invite Tom ?
I have a question for you .
He did it for the money .
This is your problem .
The door won &apos;t open .
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
I wasn &apos;t feeling very well .
Do you really want to know what I think ?
She is not herself today .
Tom admitted that he hadn &apos;t read Mary &apos;s book .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand what you said .
Tom would never have done that that way .
That doesn &apos;t concern you .
I &apos;ve remarried .
When is Tom going to come over ?
I know it &apos;s in the apartment , but I can &apos;t find it .
Is it five already ?
When do you study ?
Have you ever seen Tom &apos;s mother ?
I asked Tom where he &apos;d gone .
I read Tom &apos;s letter to Mary .
I &apos;d have come if you &apos;d invited me .
Come on !
The day isn &apos;t over yet .
Tom might be taller than you .
This we can do .
Tom dropped Mary off in front of John &apos;s .
I &apos;ll fix it .
I found your keys .
Tom arrived too early .
The shirt that I &apos;ve just bought is very nice .
I need more .
I told my parents everything .
He seems to have been ill .
I still don &apos;t see it .
Tom is used to doing his own cooking .
She &apos;s nice to me .
Tom should be back by 2 : 30 .
Tom was weary .
There are people here who need your help .
Let &apos;s drink the cup of tea here .
I &apos;m not here for a vacation .
I think that it &apos;s possible .
I finished the work in less than an hour .
You &apos;ve already told me this story .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
No one knows you &apos;re here .
Tom is holding a glass of wine .
I must get it fixed .
I &apos;ll write you a letter .
Why don &apos;t we ask Tom &apos;s advice ?
Tom is giving up .
Tom often stays up all night .
I made Tom happy .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
Tom &apos;s sister &apos;s name is Mary .
Tom said he &apos;d never leave his wife .
Give me the keys .
Which one would you like ?
Tom doesn &apos;t belong here .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that for Mary .
That &apos;s the way he likes it .
They enjoy one another &apos;s company .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Did you forget ?
I want to know what you see right now .
Tom has gone mad .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
What made her do that ?
I wanted to do that with you .
I told you Tom wouldn &apos;t want to go .
Tom has been away for three days .
He is reading a book in his room .
When &apos;s your birthday ?
Tom usually leaves home at seven .
I can &apos;t talk about this now .
Could you make time for me ?
Can you explain that to me ?
Might makes right .
Tom felt sick .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Australia .
Everybody has already left .
You look a lot older than Tom .
It &apos;s quite simple .
Tom and I often play tennis together .
We found one .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
Where did you find that dress ?
It is in the kitchen .
Tom wants you to come home .
Tom has it wrong .
They were able to do it on their own .
You must be a good walker to have walked all the way .
Tom believed it .
We &apos;re going to take good care of Tom .
Everybody likes him .
I &apos;m married .
How old are your children now ?
Did they come today ?
Are you surprised that I came ?
Can I sit with you ?
Everyone is talking about Tom .
I thought about my family .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really here .
I want to believe you .
Tom is exactly three weeks old .
Where &apos;s your phone ?
I &apos;m glad I was able to meet you yesterday .
There isn &apos;t any milk left .
We were in Boston .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t have to .
Where does Tom work ?
She left the last page blank .
When she was young , she was very beautiful .
How often do you see him ?
What did you learn ?
It is certain that he will come here .
Why do you want to do that ?
Tom says he does that .
Tom was sick last week .
We &apos;ve been asked to not do this anymore .
I was invited to Tom &apos;s party .
Tom needs water .
Tom believes it .
I would like to see that .
You and I are going to have a lot of fun .
I let you down .
He often writes to his parents .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , but he used to .
I &apos;m prepared to die .
I want you to be by my side .
You are making history .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted something to drink .
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
I won &apos;t assist you .
I &apos;d be careful .
We don &apos;t sing that song anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything .
Let &apos;s drop the subject .
Take a look .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
We &apos;re nearly out of time .
The cat slept on the table .
I &apos;ll see you later .
Do you know what happened ?
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom right now .
Do you have any idea who would do this ?
We do this all the time .
You want to go to Boston with Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t love you as much as I love you .
I waited an hour for my friend .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s really going on .
Tom likes Boston .
I want to hear it from you .
The kids are sleeping .
We went without him since he wasn &apos;t ready .
He asked the man to help him .
I think about you all the time .
He was able to solve the problem .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off of Mary .
When did you buy your car ?
The book is here .
I know what you want .
I &apos;m still in school .
She is still a girl .
Where are you taking Tom ?
Kids grow up so fast .
Tom made a promise .
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
This is where Tom used to live .
I think you look fine .
I think I found a problem .
I &apos;ll let you know in a day or so .
I don &apos;t care what Tom does .
Have you seen my son ?
Tom and Mary are both ready .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
How do you know what you should do ?
What &apos;s in this bag ?
Tom never said a word .
I &apos;m here to ask for your help .
Are you from Boston ?
It &apos;s expensive though .
It could be true .
Tom lives in a very large house .
Tom asked Mary what she had been doing all morning .
This car is too expensive .
What &apos;s it look like ?
Tom gives us everything we want .
Tom left Mary last year .
I &apos;m a little tired .
You look contented .
I &apos;ll give you anything that you want .
Don &apos;t leave me behind !
Tom might not be as happy as we think he is .
You make hardly any mistakes .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s book .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Tom saw Mary at the station .
She wants to dance .
We &apos;ve done everything possible .
I don &apos;t feel like playing either .
They can &apos;t hear you .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was already dead .
Tom is family .
Tom turned out to be right .
We have everything we need now .
We &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
Where are you going to live ?
I thought of Tom right away .
We have two television sets .
We &apos;re not giving up on Tom .
I can &apos;t open this jar .
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
What did Tom do with the money ?
I &apos;m not all that drunk .
My sister has been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t hear anything .
What are we going to do with it ?
I &apos;ve never done it before .
You ought to wait for Tom .
Do you know how to speak English ?
Tom does that because he has to .
Tom went out .
You should have stayed in the car .
Have they arrived yet ?
How young do you think Tom is ?
Tom also has a brother .
Tom is a little taller than me .
I read this book a couple of years ago .
I will be back soon .
Tom doesn &apos;t think about others .
We plan to stay a week .
I think Tom is old .
That &apos;s not a cat . That &apos;s a dog .
You look sick .
I didn &apos;t know that your mother lived with you .
The book &apos;s white .
Ask him when the next plane will be .
Tom wasn &apos;t here when I came in .
This is a great day .
Tom wanted to know everything about you .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
I don ’ t know their names .
That car is quite new .
Where are you going exactly ?
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
Tom enlisted .
I just don &apos;t get it .
I can &apos;t hear what they &apos;re saying .
You &apos;ve got to stay awake .
In the summer , people go to the beach .
Tom is taking this very seriously .
Who is your friend ?
It &apos;ll be difficult to do that .
Tom said that he was afraid to do that .
Tom got into the car and drove off .
This is where Tom lives .
He has a lot of books on history .
I was able to answer all the questions .
Tom knows what &apos;s really going on .
I would like to talk with you again .
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary is .
You should apologize .
You &apos;d better go .
I &apos;m able to read French .
I hope it won &apos;t be long before I hear from her .
Please do something about it .
I forgot the book .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s coming .
Stop doing that .
Tom , where are you ?
I &apos;ve been to Boston often enough .
You must show me how it works .
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
Tom often comes to Boston .
I &apos;m going to your house .
I asked you not to play with that .
I need to go back to Boston .
He found my bicycle .
She used to help him with his homework .
I can see a woman and two dogs in the car .
Have you had dinner ?
Do you want to go there ?
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I don &apos;t really understand French .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
Tom goes to Boston every once in a while .
I &apos;m driving to Boston on Monday .
I know what Tom knows .
Please don &apos;t go .
We &apos;ll stand .
If you wish to speak to Tom , you &apos;ll need to wait about three hours .
Tom wasn &apos;t that stupid .
My father used to eat at this restaurant .
Is there anything that you want to tell me ?
Tom said he was very tired .
I &apos;ve found it .
Yesterday , they went to the movies .
He has no interest whatsoever in money .
I couldn &apos;t sleep at all .
We must help him immediately .
You aren &apos;t invited .
I learned nothing from the teacher .
Everyone &apos;s doing it .
I want to know who you are .
Tom was one of us .
I &apos;d like to know what it is .
You can do this , can &apos;t you ?
How &apos;s the weather in Boston ?
That &apos;s good news .
Mary is the only girl Tom is really interested in .
Tom doesn &apos;t read .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that sort of thing .
How else can you account for it ?
What a beautiful night !
Who am I talking with ?
Tom has been pretending .
Tom works nearby .
See you on the weekend .
Tom spent three years in prison for what he did .
I got to the station this morning .
I don &apos;t remember Tom &apos;s face .
I wonder why Tom is here .
It is not easy to solve the problem .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave now .
You look fine , Tom .
He lost face .
We can &apos;t help you now .
Tom extinguished the fire .
I &apos;ll give you five minutes to work out this problem .
My plan is different from yours .
Studying French is a lot of fun .
I said stop .
Tom did nothing .
I will give you anything you want .
I won &apos;t tell Tom .
The word is not in my dictionary .
Tom opened a window .
I wish I had married her .
That should be enough .
I just found it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to stay at home .
I suppose I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
We &apos;re not going to find anything .
Have you ever heard of such a thing ?
It &apos;s safe here .
Is that a lot ?
I get paid tomorrow .
Can I dance here ?
Did Tom leave ?
You can count on me .
I had my car stolen .
Tom and Mary went for a walk along the beach .
The people in the other room are speaking French .
This is my brother &apos;s .
I can die happy now .
Tom has lost face .
I &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
I &apos;m happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I bought a lot of things .
He had friends all over the world .
I don &apos;t know how you do it .
There &apos;s something here Tom should see .
I learned to play guitar when I was ten years old .
You should have helped him with his work .
I got my hair done yesterday .
Tom likes to play tennis .
I have a problem and I need your advice .
Do you know whether Tom can speak French ?
We went to London last year .
I didn &apos;t understand what you said .
I was looking for Tom .
I &apos;m not doing that today .
May I help you ?
Tom came home by bus .
I &apos;m not your friend .
You should get married again .
Did you tell Tom when to come ?
Tom does have to do that .
I want a job .
I love you just as you are .
Should I wait for Tom to finish ?
You &apos;re stalling .
Did you live here before ?
Don &apos;t leave the TV on .
I bought a new pair of glasses .
I don &apos;t know them at all .
Do it again !
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
It &apos;s just a game .
She deserved it .
You don &apos;t seem to understand anything .
Has Tom ever asked you to help him ?
Where can I buy it ?
Tom was seated between Mary and John .
Why did you guys leave ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Tom is coming to dinner this evening .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Such things happen all the time .
I didn &apos;t think we were going to make it .
I &apos;ve been a teacher for two years .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
What are you saying ?
I &apos;m feeling much better today .
He begged us to go with him .
I can &apos;t even help myself .
He &apos;s new in town .
Tom isn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom is busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom is going to do this .
There is nothing that can &apos;t be bought with money .
There &apos;s not enough coffee .
My mother could speak five languages .
Tom looked around to make sure they were alone .
That &apos;s a good response .
I wanted to give Tom some money .
Tom would be a good teacher .
I need to know by tomorrow .
How fast can you run ?
I think we &apos;re fine .
This wine &apos;s very intoxicating .
Tom likes to eat out .
Can you please give me something to do ?
Tom is far from happy .
I &apos;ll be reading a book .
I could help Tom .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
She is quite satisfied with her life as it is .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
I just want people to like me .
It was all Tom &apos;s idea .
Tom is good at writing .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d want from you .
A deal is a deal .
We must work as long as we live .
Do you want to come with me ?
I don &apos;t like a world where things change so slowly .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
She &apos;s young and beautiful .
I can &apos;t find my suitcase .
There &apos;s another reason .
Tom says he can &apos;t eat any more .
The dog is as good as dead .
Your hair is too long .
You &apos;re just a boy .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
I love your son .
If you really don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
I didn &apos;t have breakfast this morning .
She told me everything .
It &apos;s your money .
We didn &apos;t get paid this week .
It wasn &apos;t that expensive .
We &apos;re doomed .
Money isn &apos;t everything .
You &apos;re good at that .
I &apos;m going to see Tom today .
I also like apples .
Are you sure Tom did that ?
I still have some homework to do .
They had fun with us .
We all looked out the window .
We expected that to happen .
Tom said he &apos;d be back soon .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary .
It hurt really bad .
Tom wears a hat every day .
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said to Mary ?
Why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
My mother was usually very busy .
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
You should have seen it .
Whoever wants it may take it .
Tom had no reason to be angry .
Tom may not know .
Let me have a look at it .
This is love .
I do not have much time .
I know what he did .
Is that the plan ?
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
May I ask you a question ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom said yes .
You &apos;re safe now .
Are you here to see Tom ?
Tom was born in Australia .
Tom found it .
Do you know where my watch is ?
Tom wasn &apos;t ready , but Mary was .
What do you want me to do with this ?
What a big dog that is !
She doesn &apos;t seem happy .
Tom said you &apos;d know .
I like to go to school .
Why isn &apos;t Tom happy ?
I was surprised to see you here .
Mary asked me if I loved her .
Mary is expecting .
Tom wants to go with you .
She won &apos;t make it .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
I know that she doesn &apos;t know who I am .
I can &apos;t live without TV .
I think these are yours .
Tom is in there with Mary and John .
Tom &apos;s wearing a new coat .
I don &apos;t want to do it like that .
I can &apos;t picture Tom doing that .
I know your father very well .
I would like to go with you .
The restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I expected it to be .
Give me the knife .
What &apos;s become of your dog ?
I was there last night .
Tom didn &apos;t give me a chance to explain what I meant .
I know where Tom is .
Tom didn &apos;t give you much choice .
Tom will go to Boston next summer .
I am really pleased with my new car .
I will give you whatever you want .
Do you have a daughter ?
I want to talk to you about last night .
Let Tom buy what he wants .
Tom spoke with Mary in French .
You are exactly like your mother .
Tom went back to sleep .
Tom said he isn &apos;t happy .
Do you have a family , Tom ?
I &apos;m a bit hungry .
We need to fix this problem right away .
I didn &apos;t hear what you said .
We want Tom to help us tomorrow evening .
I am happy that you are my friend .
I waited for Tom for three hours .
It &apos;s four o &apos;clock by my watch .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;d do without Mary .
He has not seen much of the world .
I am afraid he won &apos;t come .
What are these people doing ?
You know where Tom is .
She is fond of cake .
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d help her , but he didn &apos;t .
Is Tom in the garden ?
Do you think Tom will like it ?
My mother isn &apos;t at home .
Tom is a newcomer .
That &apos;s all I saw .
Tom wants his money today .
I wonder if Tom is nervous .
He asked us to help him .
You aren &apos;t welcome here .
This is where they usually have their evening meals .
Listening to music is lots of fun .
I came back home late .
He &apos;s no doctor .
Even now , it wouldn &apos;t be possible .
That was a good decision .
Tom needs to stop doing that .
Why don &apos;t you take a taxi ?
He doesn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
I don &apos;t eat much .
He is hard to deal with .
I like this dog .
Do you want to go , too ?
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
You can &apos;t marry Tom .
Who do you think is familiar with this matter ?
That &apos;s my mother .
I am right .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
You were pretending , weren &apos;t you ?
Are you ready ?
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Is Tom out ?
Please go .
I &apos;d never seen anything like that before .
I was very tired .
Can you show us the house ?
You &apos;re in no condition to drive .
Tom has this large room to himself .
It &apos;s getting larger .
Would you like to go ?
I &apos;d never have done that that way .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at this .
I don &apos;t watch TV anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t a very good cook .
No one was stung .
I have just what you need .
Tom speaks French fairly well , doesn &apos;t he ?
What are we doing ?
Tom never came home .
Tell Tom you want to go to Boston .
A good idea came into my mind .
Why do you always do that to me ?
I know who he is .
I still haven &apos;t found Tom .
You know I can &apos;t wait any longer .
Give these children three pieces each .
Tom wants you to do that .
We mustn &apos;t do that .
Is there anything I can do for you ?
I &apos;m hungry because I haven &apos;t had lunch .
When did you buy it ?
Tom is going to do well .
I just started reading this book .
What language is that ?
You said so yourself .
She reads the newspaper every morning .
We don &apos;t have that kind of money .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s brother .
He is about my age .
That &apos;s your job .
Let me pay for the dinner .
Tom felt better .
Don &apos;t worry about us .
That car is mine .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
That is quite possible .
Who died ?
She sat next to him on the bus .
I &apos;m not feeling well lately .
Tom is proud of his work .
I remember his face but I can &apos;t remember his name .
I hope no one sees us .
Did Tom see that ?
Tom is happy to be alive .
I think Tom is doing that , too .
I had to work .
Tom is talking to himself .
Don &apos;t you have something to say to Tom ?
Money isn &apos;t everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
You &apos;re not a child anymore .
I expected you home three hours ago .
You &apos;re not invited to lunch .
I know what they said .
She should listen more to other people .
I &apos;ve tried .
Are you sure Tom was the one who did this ?
I was busy all day .
Please give me one .
We must find them .
We &apos;re quite drunk .
I can &apos;t give it to Tom .
Mother and I were in the garden .
You must not stay in bed .
I think you &apos;re right .
You &apos;re doing everything wrong .
I don &apos;t speak French very much .
What does Tom want to say to Mary ?
Tom is being blamed for it .
I know you &apos;re here .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
What did that suggest to you ?
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
Who is it that you want to talk to ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
It &apos;s Monday .
Did you forget to buy eggs ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got much time .
I need a driver to take me home .
He stayed at the hotel .
You should call your father as soon as possible .
I &apos;m ready for anything .
The dog seems to have been sick .
Was Tom working yesterday ?
Do you have any water ?
Tom doesn &apos;t feel like eating .
I &apos;ll do anything for you .
How do you spell that word ?
Tom looks well .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
I will show it to you only once .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
Is that your sister ?
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go back to work .
The dictionary on the desk is Tom &apos;s .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t have come .
Tom acts like he knows everything .
Who made this pie ?
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
I have no money with me .
We have been here for two days .
Now I understand .
It was time to leave .
I understand you .
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
She shook hands with him .
I want you to be happy .
You look good for your age .
The plan did not succeed .
He said that if he were there , he would help her .
I should &apos;ve known this .
I know why Tom &apos;s happy .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go to bed .
The police released him .
Let &apos;s go and see Tom .
I know her well .
That &apos;s to be expected .
It &apos;s about time for you to leave .
My uncle runs a hotel .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Nothing ever happens around here .
We were right .
Tom now has a good reason to be happy .
I don &apos;t fear death .
Tom is still waiting outside .
There goes our bus .
No one lives in this building .
Where do we go from here ?
Anything worth doing is worth doing well .
What do you want to do now ?
Is it difficult to learn French ?
Tom looks like his father .
Tom didn &apos;t know that .
I saw Tom yesterday in a restaurant . He was talking to a girl .
It &apos;s lunch time .
We have the best food in town .
Tom will probably come tomorrow .
Thank you for being my friend .
I got acquainted with him three years ago .
Do you think we &apos;ll win ?
I &apos;m going outside .
Nobody gave us a chance .
Not all of us have eaten yet .
I always keep my promises .
We made him go .
Give me a light , would you ?
Tom may do that with Mary .
I was just going to leave home .
Tom was really drunk .
How long will you stay in Japan ?
It &apos;s my mistake , not yours .
That &apos;ll put you in danger .
I don &apos;t want to be in your way .
Take off your hat .
Tom wanted to be left alone .
Tom didn &apos;t understand my French .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
Do you have a lot of time ?
I &apos;m as busy as Tom .
We &apos;ll talk about that later .
What did you expect ?
I think he &apos;ll come .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; house .
It &apos;ll be fun to visit Boston .
Did you invite Tom to dinner without telling me ?
Why don &apos;t you take off your coat ?
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
There &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
I wonder if this is wrong .
She didn &apos;t give me my money back .
Make sure you do that , OK ?
How many times an hour does Tom do that ?
Tom could see Mary from where he stood .
Tom would know .
Tom is still outside .
Tell me everything you know about that .
You think I &apos;m crazy , don &apos;t you ?
I thought Tom would be too busy to help us .
You can &apos;t go home now .
I would &apos;ve liked to do that .
She didn &apos;t feel like eating lunch .
You have something on your face .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
The old man has enough money .
I was stupid enough to believe it .
We live near the large library .
What are you really here for anyway ?
I &apos;d rather not meet him .
What could I say ?
Why does Tom want to do this ?
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Tom is quite right .
Today is a good day .
It looks like Tom is in love .
They are afraid of death .
The movie isn &apos;t as good as the book .
Has your father arrived yet ?
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not going to happen .
No one works there anymore .
Tom usually walks home from work .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
The doctor gave it to her .
Is it far ?
Shall I drive you home ?
Can I have some of these ?
I only hope that that is enough .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
What else is there to say ?
Tom does everything he &apos;s told .
Where did you two first meet each other ?
He was all alone in the house .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice were all there .
Tom comes to Boston every week to see Mary .
You &apos;re old .
His story was interesting .
How did you find Tom ?
We have less than two hours .
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said .
I want you to take me to Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t young .
Tom will be back in a second .
That &apos;s interesting .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
I &apos;ll write to you as soon as possible .
I talk to Tom on the phone every day .
She told everybody at work .
Which is your guitar ?
Everyone wants something .
Did you speak with Tom ?
She seems rich .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to apologize .
Is it worth it ?
Is this the train for Boston ?
I assume after work you &apos;re going home right away .
Tom came to my office to ask me for money .
I &apos;m glad Tom enjoyed it .
They lost .
Is that book for me ?
I &apos;d like you to help Tom .
What time do you go to bed ?
That &apos;s all .
Tom asked for my help .
Tom and I don &apos;t get along .
The meat is only half cooked .
Tom was supposed to come .
Tom lives really far from here .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom and Mary never got along .
He looks strong .
You &apos;ve won !
None of his students could solve the problem .
I &apos;ve got no time for that now .
I met him on the street .
This one is for Tom .
Can you read ?
Where is the nearest bank ?
They took off after Tom .
I think I &apos;ve heard that somewhere before .
Come with me , please .
He &apos;s all right .
Do you know how busy I &apos;ve been ?
How long do I have to stay in the hospital ?
We &apos;ll let you know .
This dictionary is my sister &apos;s .
They had nothing to eat .
Tom may eat whatever he wants to .
He ran away with the money .
Tom is late .
Who saw you ?
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you soon .
Where &apos;s our money ?
Why do you always do that to me ?
He bought a new car .
I am afraid of what the teacher will say .
She hit me , not him .
I have to drive this car .
I told them everything .
I don &apos;t care if you believe me .
Please take off your hat .
Do you feel like going swimming ?
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was .
Tom often comes to see me on weekends .
Tom comes from a good family .
He is afraid of the dog .
You have no idea what this is , do you ?
I hope to see you tomorrow .
What can you tell me about that ?
Tom has a different job now .
Is he a friend of yours ?
Don &apos;t go home yet .
It &apos;s what Tom had .
Mary likes watching TV .
Tom is right .
Who did you get this from ?
This box contains five apples .
Tom was sitting at his desk .
No one will believe them .
Tom is going to go home .
That has nothing to do with him .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
Tom is the only person I &apos;ve ever really been in love with .
I saw Tom and Mary .
He doesn &apos;t know English .
Many people only speaks one language .
They all looked at Tom .
Tom was waiting for you .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
It is cool after the rain .
Are you asking me for something ?
What &apos;ll happen ?
I might never see you again .
Tom won &apos;t come .
Tom is with him .
Give me a little more water .
You &apos;re very different from us .
I left Japan for the first time in ten years .
Tom has made a mistake .
Can we go ?
Tom did this over a year ago .
My brain is full .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about that .
I can stay in the car while you go into the bank .
Would you like some coffee or something ?
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
They say that he knows the secret .
We can do it right now .
What do you think I &apos;m thinking ?
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
Tom mostly talked about Mary .
I don &apos;t think he knows I love you .
Can you read ?
What else can I do for you ?
I came for Tom .
Nobody knows his name .
Why don &apos;t you come over after work today ?
I have to go back .
I think Tom is in Boston .
Tom and I are happy .
It &apos;s very loud .
You may still do it if you want to .
How long do you have ?
Tom bought a table .
I &apos;d like you to see this .
Tom is very handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m very worried about Tom .
I was too tired to walk any farther .
Tom will be here next week .
She bought a new car .
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake .
She has a new man in her life .
He began to talk to the dog .
Tom will do it when he comes in .
You simply don &apos;t understand .
I feel sorry for her .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom got in his car and went home .
Tom is about my size .
There is no clock in my room .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything about himself .
Do a better job next time .
I like school .
I wrote it for Tom .
How can this be possible ?
I will always remember you .
It &apos;s clear .
He is said to have been strong .
It &apos;s been quite a week .
Tom wants to show you something .
It &apos;s not from me .
English is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
How many days did you spend in Boston ?
I wish I could play tennis as well as Tom does .
That &apos;s my answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much time to waste .
Tom is as tall as you .
She is young .
I &apos;m glad it makes you happy .
Tom is short , but not as short as Mary .
Tom came a little after noon .
I &apos;ll do anything you say .
This one is on me .
I speak a little French .
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;ve got almost everything I need .
It was yesterday that she went .
I will come to your party this evening .
What I meant to say was that I didn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom thinks we don &apos;t want to go .
Do you have any more questions ?
Do you think it &apos;s difficult to speak French ?
This isn &apos;t a good time .
Tom is playing .
Are you afraid of getting hurt ?
I &apos;m hungry .
I need a medic .
We may never know .
I want to sing the song .
Nobody wants him to come .
I can &apos;t give you the answer today .
I can &apos;t understand his feelings .
Where is your room ?
Have you read Tom &apos;s book ?
You &apos;re back .
I &apos;ll visit him tomorrow .
Did she say that ?
It doesn &apos;t matter to me one bit .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see that .
I constantly talk to myself .
Tom didn &apos;t want to play tennis with Mary .
Do you have a book ?
I &apos;d rather not go .
This is what we want to know .
Why don &apos;t we go and see a movie ?
Tom has always been there for me whenever I needed him .
I watch television every day .
Tom should study French .
Tom lives in Boston .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
That &apos;s a question for others to answer .
Please speak English .
Tom asked me if I wanted to do that today .
You &apos;re still young .
That &apos;s true too , isn &apos;t it ?
I can &apos;t forget Tom .
It &apos;ll rain for sure .
I guess I should &apos;ve known .
How do you like my new hat ?
I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
These are for you .
I remember how angry you made me .
I don &apos;t know yet .
You &apos;d probably really like it .
It &apos;s night .
I &apos;ve known that for a long time .
Tom can play tennis better than Mary .
They wouldn &apos;t have done anything .
The men go to work .
I &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
Are you Tom ?
Tom has been told to do that by himself .
Who &apos;s not busy ?
Tom mostly talked about his trip .
I will do it myself .
I &apos;m really old .
Let &apos;s go swimming .
Would you mind waiting a few minutes ?
I know more than you think .
It was just something I read in a newspaper .
We can &apos;t afford this .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
Do you want to play tennis with us ?
That &apos;s the one we want .
I have to go to sleep .
It &apos;s my life .
This is a good question .
I want my own room .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
Is that all you have ?
Tom has a sister .
Tom tried really hard to do that .
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week .
I can &apos;t come tomorrow .
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
Ask your dad to help you .
It &apos;s impossible .
Don &apos;t worry about it !
Tom knows him .
She is always trying new things .
Tom won &apos;t be away for long .
I assumed you would come .
I &apos;ll take you there .
I hope to see you .
You can &apos;t go where I &apos;m going .
Are you here ?
&quot; Do you think he &apos;ll come ? &quot; &quot; I hope not . &quot;
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
I gave Tom my word that I wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary about that .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
Tom knows best .
This report is well written .
This is never going to end .
I don &apos;t plan to do that by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he was hearing .
Is it OK if I tell Tom about it ?
I should have come earlier .
I assume so .
Tom is very important .
Tom has already decided where to go .
I arrived at school on time .
Tom will drive .
How long were you at the party ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
Traveling abroad is out of the question .
I &apos;ll tell you when I get back .
Those are good .
We almost missed the train .
Have you ever lost ?
We &apos;re still young .
I &apos;m finished with you .
Do you want anything to eat ?
I don &apos;t know whether he will come or not .
That &apos;s dangerous .
Tom stopped it .
I &apos;ll do that .
Tom was in love with Mary .
Tom was leaving .
Tom wanted to know if Mary had a boyfriend .
I don &apos;t know that word .
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s older brother .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
You &apos;re not bad at this .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
I could answer his question .
No one has heard Tom say Mary &apos;s name .
Would you like to see it now ?
She likes walking alone .
At first , I was disappointed .
Tom cycles to work .
He &apos;s not supposed to be here .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom &apos;s will be at the party .
Why don &apos;t you come earlier ?
If I were you , I &apos;d go home right away .
It all started in Boston .
I can &apos;t pay Tom today .
I was disappointed because you weren &apos;t at home .
What are we going to do with Tom ?
I don &apos;t deserve to live .
It was a nice party . You should have come , too .
Tom asked me to give this to you .
You &apos;re too good to me .
Tom has some money in the bank .
We need more .
You hardly ate anything .
He walked to and fro in front of her house .
Tom isn &apos;t thinking about that .
Tom told Mary that he would do that .
Is there something that you want to tell me ?
I don &apos;t know what I should &apos;ve done .
Was Tom working alone ?
Are you sure Tom did that ?
I know both of the girls .
He bought himself a dog .
Tom used to read a lot .
May I have another piece of cake ?
Tom stood quietly .
No one knows the answer .
She is two years older than you .
The train left before they got to the station .
Aren &apos;t you happy where you are ?
Tom is glad he isn &apos;t in your shoes .
What else do you need to do today ?
I wish I could dance every day .
I don &apos;t remember inviting you here .
She &apos;s waiting for you at home .
We found it here .
Let &apos;s play house .
It &apos;s bedtime .
I think this one is good .
We &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
She sat next to him .
I can hardly understand you .
I want you to remember this moment .
You shouldn &apos;t go outside on a day like this .
I just love that .
When you &apos;re a father , you &apos;ll understand .
I have one of those , too .
Why is this computer here ?
It &apos;s hard .
There &apos;s nothing more I can tell you .
It never happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it .
He is as busy as ever .
Tom says Mary isn &apos;t happy .
I will make up for it next time .
I know who likes Tom .
My father isn &apos;t home .
It was already too late .
Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a dad .
Tom is here to see you .
I misspelled the word .
Did Tom call you last night ?
Who are you and what are you doing here ?
Her dog isn &apos;t very fast .
I like it .
They don &apos;t want you to know .
You need to start meeting women .
Do you think Tom was hungry ?
We &apos;ve only got one chance .
Tom didn &apos;t try to do anything .
Tom sat down .
Tom asked for my advice .
I want my whole family to be proud of me .
I think Tom is in love with me .
Tom will help us .
Tom is very busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m safe .
I am anxious about your health .
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary can .
I &apos;m not family .
Tom should never do that again .
This isn &apos;t about Tom .
I &apos;m not feeling too well .
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston .
Which one of you is Tom ?
The girl playing the piano is my sister .
I know it &apos;s hot .
It &apos;s a problem .
She passed by without seeing me .
That &apos;s not an answer .
You have a family to think of .
I want to know what this is .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
Is it here that the bus stops ?
It wasn &apos;t a party .
Tom became very hot .
Tom has more books than I do .
Perhaps it &apos;s Tom .
She goes to school .
Tom can be relied on .
I can &apos;t depend on you anymore .
Tom really needs your help .
Can you solve this problem ?
Everyone &apos;s asleep .
I no longer want that .
Tom was fortunate .
Tom knows what Mary likes .
What are you doing home ?
Tom is not as young as I am .
How did Tom know that ?
Tom and Mary gave me that .
Tom looked around the room .
Did Tom just leave ?
I just asked because I thought you would know .
What do you want to study ?
Tom can &apos;t find his watch .
Where are the children ?
Why would you do something like that ?
All things considered , he is a good teacher .
Tom showed Mary around the office .
I &apos;ll pay for it .
How did you learn to speak French so well ?
Why can &apos;t we just tell Tom that we can &apos;t do it ?
That &apos;s what Tom said , too .
The situation won &apos;t change .
Have you ever heard Tom sing ?
What Tom says is true .
This river is very dangerous to swim in .
Whenever Tom comes to Boston , he stays with us .
I didn &apos;t expect that to come from you .
I &apos;m sure Tom will win this afternoon .
Do you want this ?
He &apos;s eating lunch now .
When did you begin studying English ?
Tom drove all night while Mary slept next to him .
Tom and Mary are college students .
Tom looks asleep .
I told Tom I wouldn &apos;t win .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re right .
This is better .
I cannot do without this dictionary .
How are things with you ?
You should &apos;ve come to the party .
It may rain .
He is good at driving .
Make way , please .
Did you ever try ?
A lot still remains to be done .
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
Don &apos;t you give up on me .
I don &apos;t want an apple .
They don &apos;t like you .
It works .
We just got started .
I feel happy .
Tom likes fish .
She killed herself yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive .
She wants to buy a car , but she can &apos;t afford to .
Tom was my boss .
My brother helped me with my homework .
Tom arrived back home safely .
His whole family is like that .
They &apos;re going to Boston .
Tom made a run for it .
Tom was with me .
I hope that you will like it .
What else did you do together ?
He pretended not to hear me .
&quot; Are you hungry ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always hungry . &quot;
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
Tom says he &apos;ll call Mary next week .
Tom is the one who asked for help .
Tom and I were both right .
Tom &apos;s scared .
I will go .
Tom would often come to see me .
Tom helped me fix my watch .
Tom walked home .
Let &apos;s not play .
Tom can &apos;t speak any French .
He shouted at the top of his voice .
You should &apos;ve seen us dancing together .
I &apos;m done with you .
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early .
I only need Tom .
Her husband wants to have his own way in everything .
I haven &apos;t seen you in three years .
You know his name , don &apos;t you ?
Tom lives with his parents .
I don &apos;t know if I can stay .
Are you free this weekend ?
We won &apos;t be here much longer .
Tom doesn &apos;t look his age .
All of the dogs were alive .
They lost everything .
Tom walks to school .
It was not very cold yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the answer yet .
Let &apos;s have some fun .
After Tom passed away , Mary went back to her parents &apos; home .
The baby was fast asleep .
I don &apos;t need your help .
Please don &apos;t bother .
It was like that when I got it .
I &apos;m not wide awake yet .
I &apos;m hanging out with my friends .
She hasn &apos;t come here yet .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom that he didn &apos;t have to come .
They have lived here for ten years .
I &apos;ve made a mistake .
I &apos;m right behind him .
He needs help .
He is walking very slowly .
Can &apos;t we just go home ?
Isn &apos;t Tom supposed to be the boss ?
Tom asked if Mary was married .
We &apos;re going to try to be there on time .
It &apos;s so quiet .
I &apos;m too busy to help you right now .
Are you really sick ?
I wish to see my father .
That &apos;s not completely accurate .
Tom said he was ready to talk .
That isn &apos;t really going to happen , is it ?
This is very bad .
You have to do as I say .
I should &apos;ve apologized right away .
I &apos;m not you .
I &apos;m the new teacher .
I got here as fast as I could .
You can do it .
I have a table .
Tom said that &apos;s no problem .
I &apos;d like to see that .
I want to speak French .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
The cat is on the table .
I want to see this .
I &apos;m not doing great .
How many people are you expecting ?
It &apos;s not possible .
Tell me what to do .
Tom called Mary to see how she was doing .
Nobody wants you to do this .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
Don &apos;t be a stranger .
Please tell me how to get to the bank .
I &apos;ll come alone .
I need a new car .
I had no idea you couldn &apos;t speak French .
Have you finished ?
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t read this .
Are we all ready ?
Isn &apos;t that what they want ?
Can you stay with Tom ?
Tom &apos;s not in .
Tom isn &apos;t going to understand .
Tom brought us each a gift .
He didn &apos;t show up .
Tom never actually lived in Boston .
What would Tom say about this ?
I &apos;ll ask him .
Can I go ?
I &apos;m too busy to talk with Tom right now .
She can play tennis very well , but I can play just about as well as she can .
I was very busy .
Do you know how Tom is doing ?
Have you eaten the cake yet ?
He will come this afternoon .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in the city .
He was foolish enough to believe what she said .
Tom stole Mary &apos;s computer .
I know how hard this must be .
No one has time for that sort of thing .
Please eat some cake .
He &apos;s often late for work .
I &apos;ve got too much to do .
I love this picture .
How could I have possibly known that ?
Tom sometimes sleeps on the floor .
They &apos;ll be looking for you .
Why do people do things like that ?
You &apos;d better go back home now .
He seems to know us .
I want to understand Tom .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
Would you like a cup of tea ?
Let &apos;s meet on Sunday .
I heard about it .
I &apos;m not afraid of the future .
There &apos;s a problem I have to talk to you about .
Is this all we need ?
I &apos;m not young anymore .
I &apos;m still the same person I used to be .
Tom is out there .
It was exactly what I needed .
Tom will know something &apos;s wrong .
You look like a boy .
I want to speak with you .
We &apos;ve got another three days .
I hate myself and I want to die .
Why don &apos;t you stop by for a little while ?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
She was sitting under a tree .
I might not like it .
You &apos;re a good boy , Tom .
How do you do it ?
I can &apos;t live without you .
I &apos;d like to ask you a couple of questions .
What time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
I expect that Tom will do more .
Please make me a cup of coffee .
I don &apos;t have enough .
We should &apos;ve done that ourselves .
I think Tom might know something .
Tom was home alone .
It &apos;s been ten years since we last met .
Don &apos;t play with me .
I knew nobody would believe me .
I am not the person I used to be .
I can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary have been together for ten years .
I find it hard to understand Tom .
Tom is your father .
How will you help Tom ?
I am to blame for this mistake .
I &apos;ll be right behind you .
What I want is to go home .
Tom came .
Women don &apos;t drive as well as men .
Nobody can solve this problem .
May I introduce myself to you ?
It is very kind of you to help me .
Here &apos;s how we do it .
You have done very well .
We &apos;re quite tired .
What are you guys going to do today ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary should do that .
All of us want to live as long as possible .
Tom broke in .
Are you , by any chance , scared of me ?
This dog is white .
Tom and I are still friends .
I need to know tomorrow .
He &apos;s not in our group .
I spoke French to Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to swim .
Is everything OK here ?
Tom will explain .
I know how much you care about Tom .
Tom told us .
A man like me needs a hat .
I will never make such a mistake again .
He died a few hours later .
What did Tom do then ?
Tom wants to be with Mary .
They may come .
You are my mother .
Why are you at home ?
The key is on the table .
We have no reason for staying here .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
I know you don &apos;t have time to help us .
I left your book in the car .
What do you want to do ?
I wanted to be free .
We didn &apos;t actually see the accident .
You have to see it to believe it .
I &apos;m not frightened of anything .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
Why do you want Tom ?
Tom may not do that .
Tom tried to get Mary to do his chores .
I can &apos;t tell you how happy I am that you &apos;ve come to visit us .
Do you have any children ?
Tom is working at a bank .
Can you swim across this river ?
They are very big apples .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I go to school on foot .
I don &apos;t want to lose this match .
Tom said he didn &apos;t find it funny .
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
You can &apos;t tell me who I can or can &apos;t talk to .
Where did you buy your car ?
I am free this afternoon .
Do you want some more milk ?
He &apos;s about the same age as you are .
Tom is thirty years old .
He needs the money .
You know what you said .
You &apos;d better leave .
I &apos;m going to stay home tonight .
Tom bought us some drinks .
Tom showed us a picture of his mother .
We &apos;ve all done it .
The idea isn &apos;t bad .
Who do you think would do such a thing ?
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s that simple .
Can I have something to eat ?
She asked him for help .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom .
My uncle is rich .
Who were you there with ?
You have a son named Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Tom says he &apos;s too tired today to help us .
He came a little after noon .
Can you swim ?
I wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
He doesn &apos;t have a family .
Why are you asking me this ?
Can you help ?
I helped them yesterday .
I don &apos;t have to be here . I &apos;m here because I want to be .
What will your husband think ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is hungry or not .
I know a very good way to get it done .
What time , exactly , did Tom leave ?
I can &apos;t see in this light .
How can we learn the truth ?
We could go there now .
Do you think I don &apos;t care ?
I don &apos;t remember what happened .
You &apos;ve done a great job .
I gave Tom one of those .
Do you have a sister ?
I sat next to him .
Someone left the water running .
He tries hard .
You may take either of the books .
I opened all my suitcases .
I thought you would come .
Boston is a big city .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
We know you &apos;re in here .
You must apologize to Tom .
Tom wondered where Mary was and what she was doing .
I speak three languages .
You must be the new teacher .
I &apos;ll see you at home .
Did you hear it too ?
I &apos;ve got this little job I want you to do .
Tom and Mary are there with John now .
Is that new ?
You never told me you had a brother .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m doing this correctly .
Tom wants to learn how to play piano .
Tom looks drunk .
I can &apos;t tell Tom that .
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
You have a message .
It &apos;ll surely rain today .
When will you come back to school ?
Don &apos;t worry too much about that .
Haven &apos;t you done anything yet ?
That &apos;s no longer possible .
Tom &apos;ll pay .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
Tom knows where we are .
Tom spent a lot of time with Mary .
Why do you want to do this ?
I won &apos;t help you .
You don &apos;t have a chance .
I told her that she was right .
I &apos;ve been doing that for years .
We can talk about this later .
Tom isn &apos;t a student . He &apos;s a teacher .
She knows where we live .
That house belongs to me .
Do you feel like eating ?
Why are you planning on going home early today ?
Tom may be there .
Tom came home drunk from a party .
I &apos;m asking you as a friend .
I just finished breakfast .
The dog looks hungry .
What do you think of me ?
I gave Tom that .
What &apos;s your father &apos;s name ?
It was white .
I &apos;ll read this book .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
Tom ran past Mary .
I was late for work this morning .
Don &apos;t open this door , please .
When do you play tennis ?
They &apos;ve seen Tom .
I don &apos;t understand a word of what he says .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any French .
It was a bad idea .
I didn &apos;t see a doctor last year .
Is your mother a good cook ?
I think Tom got scared .
It &apos;s our car .
When are they coming ?
I &apos;m going to wait here for Tom .
I gave Tom Monday off .
We have to do that .
We &apos;ll walk .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have enough money .
I &apos;ll be home alone all night .
My husband is a doctor .
Tom won &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
Please tell us something about yourself .
I met Tom at a party .
Do you know who I am ?
I don &apos;t like to speak in front of people .
Would you like for me to do that for you ?
Tom probably won &apos;t be here today , either .
Things look good .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all of the questions .
Tom asked Mary to open the door for him .
How many times have you done this ?
Tom likes to drive fast .
Why should I care what you think ?
Tom doesn &apos;t let people into his house .
You should do that right away .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go home .
Many students bought the book .
I haven &apos;t seen anything of her lately .
Tom has all day to get that done .
Tom and I already know each other .
Tom is likely to come .
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
You had better not drive a car .
Do it right now .
I tried to tell Tom .
I &apos;m looking forward to visiting your country this winter .
I don &apos;t like to think about it .
I may go swimming today .
That wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
Tom isn &apos;t at home .
We shouldn &apos;t swim here .
Did Tom have dinner ?
Tom needed space .
I &apos;m hungry .
Tom made himself something to eat .
This is our home .
Don &apos;t leave here until you have done it .
You need to apologize .
Can you speak French ?
I don &apos;t like it here .
I &apos;m a quick learner .
Let them all come .
My dog sleeps on the floor next to my bed .
He has money , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom read thirty books last year .
I have a problem .
We almost had Tom convinced .
He looks young .
Tom did that .
As I missed the train , I had to wait for the next one for about an hour .
She told me a lot about you .
We can do a lot more .
That &apos;s just what one would expect of him .
It &apos;s difficult to explain .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve found you .
If I knew it , I would tell you .
It will stop raining before long .
I figured that might be the case .
Are you tired now ?
He is much older than he looks .
He was speaking .
Those things happen .
I really don &apos;t feel good .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
I was unable to finish my homework .
This has never been attempted before .
They say she &apos;s sick .
Tom saved Mary a seat .
How often do you eat out ?
Can &apos;t you buy a car ?
I haven &apos;t really told you anything you shouldn &apos;t have already known .
I don &apos;t have to say anything to Tom .
I think you should see a doctor .
You should &apos;ve seen that movie last night .
Why aren &apos;t you doing that ?
I remember a time when we could tell each other anything .
I wonder what has become of his sister .
It would &apos;ve been so easy .
Tom invited me to a party at his home .
He &apos;s just showing off in front of the girls .
Can you come tomorrow ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good choice .
I looked around , but saw nobody .
He lives somewhere around here .
I &apos;ve read your book . It was very interesting .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of music .
I would like to learn how to dance .
I would like to visit you .
I &apos;ve won first prize !
I &apos;ve got a proposition for you .
Who spoke ?
I know that wasn &apos;t how I was supposed to do that .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy .
Tom is the same age as Mary .
She cannot have understood what you said .
I &apos;ve got to call Tom .
What made you think Tom did that ?
I &apos;m hungry because I haven &apos;t eaten .
Now he tells me the truth .
Tom asked me how often I went to Australia .
Mary came up to me when she saw me .
Can you walk to school , or do you have to take the bus ?
Tom read a book while he was waiting for the bus .
He knows the secret .
I think you went too far .
He hung up .
Tom is old school .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off of Mary .
Is it too far to walk ?
When have you ever done anything for me ?
What time &apos;s the meeting ?
Tom will never understand .
Tom walks fast .
Let &apos;s talk about this later .
Did you eat too much ?
That doesn &apos;t work at all .
Did you see it ?
That &apos;s not what was supposed to happen .
I know your brother very well .
I told Tom that I was tired .
I don &apos;t hate you .
When do you usually go to bed ?
Does it get any better than this ?
Where were they ?
We &apos;ll go together .
Thank you for coming .
Tom is going to like it .
This is the camera which I bought yesterday .
We meet here once a month .
You seemed to enjoy doing that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be there .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know my name .
Tom stayed in his car .
He walked rapidly .
Why did you leave ?
This is all your fault .
They &apos;re coming to the park by bus .
We have a job to do .
Tom wants a dog .
Take a walk .
The weather has a great deal to do with our health .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
Tom enjoys school .
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning ?
Why would I do that ?
He has one dog and six cats .
She ought to be at the office by now .
This is the house where I was born .
Tom was quite pleased with himself .
Tom is doing what he has to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French well and I don &apos;t either .
It makes me so angry .
There is nothing to apologize for .
She understands music .
Tom and Mary were watching television when I got home .
You &apos;re just the person we need .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
He came late , as is often the case with him .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
Tom is now somewhere in Australia .
Tom said that you stole my money .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know you .
I &apos;m glad to see you , Tom .
I &apos;ll get this .
What happened to you yesterday ?
I &apos;m here , too .
Tom saw Mary doing that .
Tom is good to me .
Can I see , too ?
I &apos;m not tired yet .
Tom has already seen it .
Tom said Mary is ready .
It &apos;s okay .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
Tom stood looking out one of the windows .
We no longer need you .
They were busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time to help Mary right now .
Tom asked Mary about her life in Australia .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
I went there to see her .
He didn &apos;t see anything .
Tom told us about his trip .
She likes to read books .
I know I &apos;m going to die .
Has Tom done that recently ?
Why do you want to do that anyway ?
I don &apos;t want to be the one to tell Tom that .
I have to be there before seven .
It &apos;s much too dangerous here .
She got angry .
The lights came back on .
Tom has seen it , too .
Tom was fatally injured .
Give me another cup of coffee .
You &apos;re very busy .
I think it &apos;s important to tell the truth .
Who found this ?
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to stay any longer .
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour .
I just didn &apos;t know what to do .
Why don &apos;t you go to school ?
I know Tom helped you .
Tom is always making me angry .
Tom was at school .
He was surprised to learn this .
Everything is all right .
Tom left five minutes early .
Tom found one .
Do it the way I told you to .
What were Tom and Mary doing at the hospital ?
Nobody was listening .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
I need to know where you are .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
I bought this watch at the store .
Is she gone ?
You &apos;re welcome to stay as long as you want .
You do what you have to do .
Tom is too good for you .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
You still have a lot to learn .
She must have been rich .
This matter does not concern me .
I went to the station .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
I like this dog .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I don &apos;t feel well today .
I &apos;m expected .
Everyone was satisfied .
I beg you to help us .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
We can &apos;t stop now .
I wonder if I should answer his letter .
She was kind enough to show me around the town .
Tom can &apos;t go home until after 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t feel like telling her the truth .
I still don &apos;t like to driving the city .
I don &apos;t eat bread .
I don &apos;t understand why this isn &apos;t working .
She hardly ate anything .
Don &apos;t listen to that man .
I don &apos;t understand what the problem is .
Don &apos;t give the dog anything to eat .
I &apos;m hitting the road .
You &apos;re up early .
Every student has to leave school by six .
You won &apos;t die today .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t give me anything .
Tom walks .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about this .
Where will you have lunch today ?
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
We &apos;d love to work with you .
When was the last time you bought shoes ?
Tom can &apos;t seem to understand what Mary is trying to say .
He wore glasses .
I can &apos;t hear it .
I &apos;m about Tom &apos;s age .
We &apos;re not friends anymore .
This isn &apos;t about me .
I know Tom is your friend .
You should have come to us .
He will soon be a father .
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time .
Don &apos;t leave the TV on .
You need to stay awake .
Tom is sleeping on the sofa .
He would be glad to hear that .
I just need five minutes .
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary .
She needs it .
Things change .
Tom won &apos;t be here much longer .
I want to go abroad .
This book is yours .
My father is rich .
I think so , too .
He seems to know the secret .
Why did you buy it ?
What &apos;s that about ?
I have trouble understanding French .
I have a lot more homework than Tom does .
Have you ever lost ?
I haven &apos;t seen that in a long time .
You &apos;re looking good !
Tom should &apos;ve done it that way .
I need someone to talk with .
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak much French .
What else did you eat ?
I &apos;d like to stay for one night .
Tom stopped talking .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want you here ?
What are you two doing out here ?
We don &apos;t know what it is .
These things take time .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy to me .
That &apos;s what everyone does .
Tom is young , but he knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom didn &apos;t have any shoes on .
I &apos;ll do what I can .
Why is Tom not here ?
I now finally understand what Tom was trying to tell me .
A penny for your thoughts .
I find it difficult to believe .
Mary is as tall as Tom is .
I don &apos;t want to see him at all .
You have everything .
I have little money now .
I no longer need it .
Have you decided to go to Australia ?
I don &apos;t like either of them .
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up .
I can &apos;t just pretend nothing happened .
Are you alone now ?
Tom was better than I expected .
He does not like us .
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive ?
It was a good answer .
Is he a teacher ?
This is what you have to do .
Is this the best you can do ?
Can you walk to school , or do you have to take the bus ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary has gone .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I read a book .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he was married .
Tom asked us to be quiet .
Tom could still be alive somewhere .
Were you expecting something different to happen ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
What do you think you &apos;re doing ?
What &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
They all looked at Tom .
I can &apos;t find Tom .
You leave me no choice .
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
Where &apos;s my hat ?
I like to study languages .
That &apos;s for sure .
How did he come here ?
Do you have any more questions ?
I couldn &apos;t speak .
It &apos;s not the end of the world .
It &apos;s no use going there .
Tom told me to speak to you in French .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
How do you think they &apos;d do it ?
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the office .
You are what you are .
His house is by the river .
I hope that Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
I should never have started smoking .
Tom could be telling the truth .
I can &apos;t get anybody to tell me anything .
Tom made a lot of money .
I thought you &apos;d like Tom .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have much money .
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak French very well .
I need a little more time .
The room was packed with people .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done any better .
Did that really just happen ?
All the food was gone .
I will give you anything you want .
I didn &apos;t tell him everything .
Are you afraid of getting hurt ?
We have no clue where he is .
Tom crashed into a tree .
Tom had trouble explaining what he wanted .
Don &apos;t be stupid .
That &apos;s not nice .
It &apos;s never too late .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t forget Tom .
Open your mouth and close your eyes .
I want him to play the guitar .
It &apos;s what I do .
They &apos;re yours .
Did you see her there ?
Tom brought Mary a gift .
Is this true ?
What time does the first train leave ?
All I can say is that I &apos;d rather not go .
Tom still sometimes studies French .
May I ask a couple of questions ?
I often go swimming in the river .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
I told Tom what Mary did .
Tom is paying .
Tom could write his name when he was three years old .
When we are told not to come , we become all the more eager to go .
Tom is looking good today .
It doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;ll get paid this week .
You could never do that .
It &apos;s very , very hot here .
I study English after dinner .
Don &apos;t you know what to do ?
I think I &apos;ve heard enough .
Tom said that was the first time he &apos;d ever done that .
Which did you eat , fish or meat ?
Why are they doing that ?
Tom let us all down .
I can &apos;t leave work until five .
Tom may have said that .
It &apos;s hot today .
Tom said he was ready .
Have you seen this man ?
I &apos;m not sure I want Tom working for us .
I don &apos;t think that Tom is happy .
We never get enough to eat .
He &apos;s looking at you .
We &apos;re out of money .
See you .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that .
You should try a little harder .
I want Tom to be safe .
I &apos;ve got wine .
Tom bought that camera because Mary thought it was the one he should buy .
May I go with you ?
I know what I &apos;ll do .
What did you learn at school today ?
I can find my own way out .
Is Tom good at driving ?
I don &apos;t have time to make you a sandwich .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to help you .
Tom wants money .
I &apos;m still Mary &apos;s boyfriend , I think .
Tom is writing a book about his father .
Tom had no right to do what he did .
Why couldn &apos;t you just ask someone for directions ?
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
Where &apos;s your car ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to tell Tom .
I put it in your room .
She isn &apos;t running .
I hope that you will like it .
She &apos;s wearing a hat .
Thanks for this , Tom .
I would do anything for Tom .
What do you do ?
Tom can &apos;t win and he knows it .
Did you forget to buy eggs ?
I &apos;d like you to meet my son .
I &apos;m not going out .
You must tell me .
Where is my car ?
What are you planning to do after this is over ?
I never heard him sing .
They &apos;re too big .
I really have to get this done today .
We have to do it together .
Tom said he &apos;s very happy .
He speaks French .
It &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
Do you want a car ?
I am sick and tired of him .
Tom didn &apos;t get paid .
Tom didn &apos;t give up .
When did the accident take place ?
This room is too small for us .
Don &apos;t go yet .
You don &apos;t know what I know .
Do you have a moment ?
No one can help you .
That &apos;s easy for you to say .
Tom never forgot .
Tom looks great .
I don &apos;t know those people .
I thought Tom was in love with Mary .
I love your daughter .
Tom knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
I really feel for you .
Tom looks good .
You should keep your promise .
That &apos;s possible .
Tom never takes the train .
Tom got very tense .
The child is learning quickly .
Can you swim across this river ?
What else do you know about Tom ?
It &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
I didn &apos;t expect you to get here so soon .
Is Tom tall ?
What is going on here ?
How long were you in Boston ?
We used to be in school together .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a brother .
I &apos;m going to bed .
I know what I need to do .
What do I have ?
He has money , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom sat next to Mary on the couch .
I like cake .
We know you have it .
I need to go to work .
He had more than enough money .
Tom put the book on the table .
You must do it yourself .
I &apos;d like to go with Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom can be left alone .
Tom was there with his girlfriend .
Tom gave Mary everything he had , but she still wasn &apos;t satisfied .
My son is ten years old .
What time and where could we meet ?
Is your family OK ?
Why not take a few days off ?
I &apos;m glad you are all here .
He wants to learn to swim .
Tom likes French .
Did she say it ?
I can &apos;t afford to play tennis .
That &apos;s kind of you , Tom .
How long does it take to get from here to the station ?
We aren &apos;t children .
Tom knows where it is .
Are you ready to eat ?
I &apos;m going to make it .
Tom got up at 6 : 30 as usual .
They left one after another .
Do you want me to tell you how to do that ?
She took a job in a store for the summer .
Tom helped Mary with her homework .
English is not hard to learn .
Help yourself to a piece of cake .
He doesn &apos;t look his age .
All is quiet .
I can get it from Tom .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money on me .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
Ask your dad to help you .
It was a little fun .
I already know .
This isn &apos;t my bag .
Could you help me ?
Tom sat in front of me .
That &apos;d be nice .
We can depend on Tom .
We aren &apos;t going to sing that song .
I &apos;m very busy today .
I met him while he was in Japan .
What do you think of that ?
Aren &apos;t you guys done yet ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
By the time I arrived , he had already left .
She gets up at seven .
I had so much fun doing that .
We need to do this report again .
Tom tends to be late .
How did you find us ?
Many of my friends don &apos;t have children .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
Did Tom tell you that ?
I &apos;ve asked Tom not to do that .
Are you free tomorrow ?
We &apos;ve already begun .
This is mine , and that &apos;s yours .
I can &apos;t find a good job .
We &apos;re ready when you are .
Tom said he can &apos;t eat that much food by himself .
We don &apos;t do this often enough .
That is not your knife .
Why are these people here ?
Tom asked Mary not to leave him alone .
Why do you think Tom likes it ?
I &apos;ll have no choice .
That &apos;s how we want you to do it .
Let &apos;s do that again .
Please let me go .
How was I supposed to know ?
What do you want to study at college ?
Tom worked all day long .
I &apos;ve visited Boston before .
Is she beautiful ?
Come see me again .
Tom got sick .
They &apos;re not coming .
Tom gave it to me .
I would like to meet him .
Tom never seems to know what to say .
I &apos;ll do that .
You can &apos;t help now . It &apos;s too late .
We don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom will be very proud of you .
Are you busy ?
He doesn &apos;t like fish .
Give Tom a drink .
You must do as you are told to do .
Tom knew what kind of woman Mary was .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem ?
Thanks for helping .
They went crazy .
She was ill for a long time .
Tom was fuming .
Where &apos;s your family ?
Tom can speak French pretty well .
I relied on him .
I don &apos;t think I want to talk about it .
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
I &apos;m good at cooking .
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m seeing .
Tom died the next day .
Tom works for a large company .
Tom is getting ready .
Is your mom at home ?
Tom acted as if he hadn &apos;t heard me .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom is unafraid .
Tom usually does what he says he &apos;ll do .
You must hurry up .
This is a message for Tom .
Tom told Mary it wouldn &apos;t be easy .
Do you want the job or not ?
Tom seemed to be very afraid .
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t even know each other .
Tom is here for you .
Tom &apos;s not in the hospital .
Tom &apos;s apartment was small .
She left me standing there for two hours .
What &apos;s the best way to approach a girl ?
That &apos;s what I love about you , Tom .
She helps him .
After lunch today , our plan is to take a walk in the park .
Tom has more books than he can read .
Don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
Who gave that to you ?
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;ll do .
Tom is thinking about it .
It &apos;s dangerous to go there alone .
Tom knew that what he was doing was wrong .
It just has to be done .
I let Tom do that yesterday .
You know better .
Don &apos;t you want to do this ?
This table is in the way .
I remember seeing the movie before .
Tom said that he &apos;d come .
You should &apos;ve seen us dancing together .
Well , what was I supposed to say ?
Give it to him .
Everybody had a problem with Tom .
Tom will go alone .
That &apos;s not true .
If anyone can do it , you can .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house for dinner .
You do look a little better today .
Tom made a decision .
Tom wanted to know when it happened .
Tom appears satisfied .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be here .
I want to know how you did it .
Tom took a week off .
Her bike is better than mine .
Tom was last .
Tom told me he hasn &apos;t done that yet .
Who can that be ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom was so old .
I don &apos;t want it anymore .
Who asked you to help ?
&quot; Who helped you ? &quot; &quot; Tom did . &quot;
Tom seems tough .
Could you explain to me what happened ?
Isn &apos;t that a good thing ?
You should marry Tom .
Do you really want someone else to do it ?
He comes to visit us every now and then .
It &apos;s going to happen , but not anytime soon .
Tom didn &apos;t feel well .
There are a lot of dogs here , aren &apos;t there ?
Tom will be there .
Does Tom know how to drive ?
Tom left immediately .
I still don &apos;t know what happened .
I &apos;ve been in Boston since October .
You were never alone .
What are you doing out there ?
How could Tom possibly win ?
Tom has barely said a word all day .
I &apos;m not Tom .
He didn &apos;t think it was funny .
We can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom we saw .
I will write you back soon .
I &apos;m not the problem .
I really need a job .
That &apos;s what we want to know .
How can I contact Tom ?
From this point , we &apos;ll go on by car .
Nobody needs me .
What do you have in your hand ?
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t talk about that .
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up .
We have enough food now .
I know that you know that I know .
You &apos;d better stop smoking .
Who told you I would help you ?
Tom looks like his brother .
I go to bed at ten almost every day .
You &apos;ll do great .
Tom always kept his promises .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
Tom had no idea that Mary was already married .
You are good .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been doing what he was doing .
Who are you and why are you here ?
How long are you planning to stay ?
It &apos;s Tom .
We &apos;ve already lost three days .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
How long were you there ?
We &apos;ve arrived safely .
I called my mother up from the station .
How are things in Australia ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to do that .
Since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
We found it .
I put on my shirt .
Why is your French so good ?
I think Tom has never been to Boston .
I wonder why I &apos;m so tired .
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
We still need your help .
He can speak five languages .
This house is quite small .
You know that better than I do .
Tom told Mary about his new car .
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t gotten married so young .
You didn &apos;t call me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
Tom isn &apos;t like people say he is .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether he can do it , but he &apos;ll give it a try .
Don &apos;t give me that look .
Where do you want to live ?
I can &apos;t understand this at all .
She was afraid of the dog .
He goes to bed at eight o &apos;clock .
Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name is John .
Did Tom pay , too ?
Tom seemed surprised by this .
I have to get that .
You can &apos;t have both .
Have you read the book Tom bought for you ?
Let &apos;s go now .
Both Tom and Mary study French .
I want to know what &apos;s in this box .
Tom lost again .
I have to walk back to the hotel .
Tom does not look happy .
You &apos;re never satisfied with anything I do .
I don &apos;t think we were seen .
That &apos;s what I think , too .
I &apos;m glad that you asked Tom for advice .
I &apos;m very glad I wasn &apos;t there .
He doesn &apos;t look happy .
Tom won &apos;t be here next month .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
I helped my father yesterday .
Tom wanted to learn to swim .
Such a thing occurs frequently .
My brother is a teacher .
Tom may be doing that .
I &apos;ve eaten a great deal of food this week .
I don &apos;t understand this word .
I don &apos;t like you , Tom .
Tom was born in Boston .
Tom said that he &apos;d be right back .
I &apos;ll help Tom .
We were worried .
I hope no one saw you .
Did anybody else see it ?
Your letter made me happy .
I can &apos;t go with you .
His house is near a river .
I &apos;ve come for Tom .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Today is Monday .
Tom told me he was going to talk to Mary .
I &apos;ll take the bus .
He told the truth .
Suit yourself .
Why are you learning English ?
This is too small .
The doctor called him back .
I think about Tom all the time .
You didn &apos;t tell him anything ?
I &apos;m going to Australia .
What &apos;s the best way to get to the airport ?
What shall I do with it ?
This is what I want .
You don &apos;t drink enough water .
Let &apos;s write a book .
You must eat something .
He must not find out the truth .
I do not know if it will rain tomorrow .
I &apos;m absolutely sure !
You &apos;re the same age as my son .
Would you like me to help you do that ?
Tom likes animals more than people .
I think Tom is fine .
Why did you abandon me ?
Where do Tom and Mary live ?
He lives alone .
We were surprised when we saw him in the office this morning .
Tom said good night to Mary and left .
Tom is always very busy .
You &apos;re among friends .
He lives above me .
The school needed a new teacher .
He came home very late .
I &apos;d think you &apos;d understand .
He seldom , if ever , goes to the movies .
I really like that girl .
She let him drive on his own .
I think I &apos;m right .
Tom says he wants to do that .
You don &apos;t need to work today .
You &apos;d better leave now .
He is at his desk .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that .
He got angry .
That was loud .
Pass it to me .
I don &apos;t like Boston that much .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
This is not my problem .
What were you two doing there anyway ?
What am I going to do about Tom ?
I like to know what &apos;s going on .
I don &apos;t think I can get through all this work by five .
This is a daily occurrence .
What do you like about her ?
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
I can &apos;t sleep with the lights on .
My birthday falls on Sunday .
Tom bought a hat .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
I &apos;m not entirely sure .
Nobody believes me .
Tom says that he wants me to go to Boston with Mary .
I &apos;m not angry anymore .
Are we in danger ?
Can we afford all this ?
I &apos;ve been trying to call Tom all day .
Do you want me to go to Boston ?
You &apos;d better not go there again .
If only I &apos;d been a little taller !
Who gave you that ?
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
I should move to Boston .
Don &apos;t you know what happened yesterday ?
It &apos;s just a cat .
We all make mistakes , don &apos;t we ?
You are a doctor .
Perhaps Tom wanted to do that .
Speaking French is difficult .
It &apos;s OK .
I &apos;ve fallen in love with you .
I must remind you about your promise .
Are they still in bed ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave .
I want to be happy .
Tom is waiting to speak to Mary .
I &apos;m going to turn in early tonight .
He is afraid of his father .
Tom did this .
I can &apos;t believe I didn &apos;t even think of that .
I don &apos;t have Tom &apos;s money .
My family thinks I &apos;m rich .
He got off the train .
My father takes a walk every day .
I heard her singing a song .
Did someone die ?
Can you remember how to play that song ?
My friend helped me .
Tom might have stolen Mary &apos;s camera .
This is a hotel .
I don &apos;t understand .
You are not to blame for the accident .
Tom gave it to Mary .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
I don &apos;t think he has anything to do with the matter .
How long have you had this problem ?
Tom drove Mary to the hospital .
Where &apos;s today &apos;s newspaper ?
I don &apos;t recall asking you for help .
I want you to do that with Tom .
What &apos;s that thing you have in your hand ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me three hours ago ?
What &apos;ll you do after school today ?
My car is three years older than yours .
You can tell the truth .
We &apos;re all proud of you .
Where do you see yourself in five years ?
How was your weekend ?
I must remember to see her .
Tom made a good choice .
You &apos;ll be with me .
I know Tom loves Mary .
You and I are good friends .
He asked me to open the door .
You must show me how it works .
Would you like to have some tea ?
I do not care for him .
Tom cooks well .
Tom and Mary are listening .
The key is on the desk .
Give me those .
I have a family .
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
The police were here .
Tom didn &apos;t know what he was doing .
We &apos;re coming .
I did it the way he told me to .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a month .
Is breakfast ready ?
They &apos;ll take care of Tom .
I know what happened to Tom .
You must think for yourself .
I don &apos;t want you to see this .
Tom and Mary are waiting .
Your father loves you .
You can have as many as you want .
I hope Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
We haven &apos;t met yet .
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
I don &apos;t know your brother .
What &apos;s Tom have to do with it ?
Tom sometimes says things he doesn &apos;t really believe .
She gave it to him .
It won &apos;t happen unless you make it happen .
I would &apos;ve let Tom do it .
I &apos;m planning to come .
This clock is mine .
Can you imagine that ?
I &apos;ll be back in about an hour .
I &apos;m not married yet .
How is it going ?
I &apos;m not a woman .
You &apos;re home early .
Everyone was looking at me .
You &apos;re in great danger .
Tom deserves to know what happened .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
Tom said it was a problem .
I don &apos;t like it when you do that .
I know very little about him .
I don &apos;t really have a boyfriend .
He always leaves home at seven .
Tom has a bicycle .
Tom took some more of the bread .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom and Mary are going to get married .
I don &apos;t know what to do either .
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
Why didn &apos;t anyone come ?
Tom went out to eat .
We &apos;re on your side .
These questions are easy to answer .
I know where you are .
I thought I &apos;d left it at home .
He is not young .
Tom wouldn &apos;t discuss money .
Is he taller than his brother is ?
Don &apos;t come after me .
Have you seen it ?
Let me pay for your coffee .
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
Would you like to play tennis on Sunday ?
Did you tell Tom when to come ?
Reading books is interesting .
What &apos;re you doing with Tom &apos;s stuff ?
Tom is the one I saw .
I &apos;m ready .
I &apos;m at home every evening .
I &apos;m sure that your parents are very proud of you .
I did it and I would do it again .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough time .
The man &apos;s name is Tom .
Tom asked Mary some questions that she was unable to answer .
This ought to be fun .
It &apos;s our fault .
I have some work to do this evening .
This is your wine .
This is difficult to do .
I &apos;ll be free tomorrow afternoon .
Tom will find something .
It &apos;s not too late .
I want you to go to Boston .
You look just like him .
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
I was tired so I went to bed .
Have you ever been abroad ?
Tom did badly at school .
Tom has come a long way .
Why doesn &apos;t anybody help Tom ?
He didn &apos;t see anybody .
He told everybody at school .
I don &apos;t care what Tom says .
I have everything I wanted .
We &apos;ll use what we have .
Tom may change his mind later .
You should &apos;ve known better .
It &apos;s very satisfying .
Why are you reading that ?
Tom said he wanted to go to Boston .
Tom died .
Why does this always happen to me ?
I must remind you of your promise .
They tell me you &apos;re OK .
It is foolish of you to believe such a thing .
Is that all we need ?
What &apos;s Tom going to say about that ?
Tom stayed late .
Did you find someone to help you ?
I should &apos;ve given you this sooner .
Tom grew up in a small town in Australia .
Tom looked very old .
I think I &apos;m going to go home .
Tom isn &apos;t seeing Mary .
That &apos;s what Tom thought .
We love coming here .
I don &apos;t care who Tom gives this to .
Tom hasn &apos;t written to Mary in a long time .
That &apos;s not exactly true .
A dog is a man &apos;s best friend .
What do I have to do ?
I &apos;m on the phone with Tom now .
My father often falls asleep while watching TV .
These are beautiful flowers .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d help him .
Perhaps I can help you .
Why are you showing me this ?
It &apos;s their choice .
It &apos;s time to go to sleep .
I &apos;ll take that one .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
Tom can &apos;t swim as well as Mary can .
You must have made a mistake .
I &apos;d like to know what you think .
When I was about to leave my house , I got a phone call from Tom .
Tom made fun of me .
You worked hard .
What does Tom say ?
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
Why &apos;s Tom like that ?
Do you know why Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with us ?
Where did you hear that ?
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
Tom and Mary are working nearby .
Please don &apos;t look at me like that .
I &apos;m seeing you in a new light .
This isn &apos;t money .
I don &apos;t want to do that with Tom .
I still don &apos;t speak much French .
If I had money , I could buy it .
I &apos;ve got to get dressed for school .
I have no one else to talk to .
Tom and Mary look good together .
I took off my shirt .
I want Tom here .
We will discuss this problem later .
Tom was definitely afraid .
Tom won &apos;t be back .
Do you want to study with me ?
You disappointed me .
How long do you need to stay in Boston ?
Do you want to hear it ?
What else can I do ?
Tom was thirty when he died .
If you speak French , I won &apos;t understand .
Tom asked Mary to make him something to eat .
Tom is already here , but Mary isn &apos;t here yet .
It didn &apos;t surprise me at all that Tom didn &apos;t do what he &apos;d told Mary he was going to do .
Tom gave Mary a key to his apartment .
I &apos;ll go to school .
I &apos;m glad I was able to help you last week .
I don &apos;t care .
I hope you two are hungry .
My problem is I &apos;m too busy .
Tom makes a good living .
I think no one knows .
It &apos;s going to be good .
You are a good person .
I love her so much that I can &apos;t leave her .
Tom looked away .
You &apos;ll want to see this .
Tom has to stop doing that .
It must be true .
What are you implying ?
How often do you go abroad ?
She wanted to understand .
I bought a new bicycle .
I think Tom and Mary are right .
I was afraid of my father .
Tom likes him .
Can we afford it ?
I &apos;d like to see what you have in your hand .
I thought this was important .
I know why you aren &apos;t happy here .
If you want , you can go .
It has to be me .
Tom speaks French as well as anybody else in this room .
This is what we want to know .
I wonder why he is late .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to heaven .
The gate was open .
Have you ever watched this film ?
My family &apos;s not rich .
Would you like some coffee or something ?
Is there anyone else ?
Those two children were the same age .
I didn &apos;t catch any fish .
What type of music do you like ?
Above all , children need love .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll come .
Go home quickly .
We have everything we want .
Are you out of work ?
Let me explain .
Could you please wait until I &apos;m finished ?
Tom wants to work for Mary .
Tom can &apos;t see anything without his glasses .
I &apos;ll tell you .
Tom plays tennis very well .
Everyone wants money .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
I met him .
Please teach me how to do that .
I &apos;m not sure about this .
I think that Tom speaks French well .
I &apos;m not disappointed whatsoever .
Tom seems quite busy .
Why shouldn &apos;t Tom leave ?
Tom can read well .
He &apos;s old enough to go to school .
Mary is not my sister .
Tom has a sister about your age .
I took the day off .
I &apos;m through doing that .
Tom is quite busy just now .
I &apos;m afraid .
Can you drive a car ?
You must not speak so loudly here .
You have to answer this question .
I &apos;m glad it &apos;s all over .
I won &apos;t die .
They &apos;re cold .
I don &apos;t have a telephone .
You sure eat a lot .
It &apos;s not worth much .
Tom should know .
Here &apos;s a picture of Tom .
I know that name .
How did Tom accomplish that ?
Let &apos;s go swimming .
I hope that he will help me .
He got to school just in time .
I don &apos;t know either .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you as well .
I &apos;ve just seen Tom .
Someone has stolen all my money .
Where are Tom and his family living now ?
I could have done it without your help .
She got a present from her boyfriend .
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
I was foolish enough to believe him .
I have read this book before .
Tom and I aren &apos;t going to study together this evening .
I &apos;ll need your help .
I have no idea of what to expect .
I &apos;ve given you my answer already .
That &apos;s no reason to get mad .
I don &apos;t have anything to give you .
When will you be free ?
I &apos;ll be here .
We &apos;re in love .
I want to take Tom home .
It won &apos;t change anything .
It &apos;s difficult to help people who don &apos;t want your help .
Music makes our life happy .
I &apos;m going back to America .
I know that Tom and Mary are married to each other .
His name will soon be forgotten .
Tom likes what he sees .
When you know , let me know .
The cats are afraid of water .
I made it .
I read a book .
Tom doesn &apos;t like you very much either .
Tom doesn &apos;t like eggs .
Tom thought we should leave early .
How &apos;s your French coming ?
I know where you can find Tom .
Tom got paid today .
My children really like animals .
What time will we arrive in Boston ?
I hate people like you .
I don &apos;t know what to say about that .
Everything I did , I did for Tom .
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea ?
We saw everything .
I bought many books .
I &apos;m never eating here again .
We were happy .
Nobody wants you to do that .
They don &apos;t know what they should do with the money .
They &apos;re not there .
Could you do that for me ?
We &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
No one was at home .
How does Tom go to school ?
Nobody I know knows how to do that .
Tom asked me if I found what I was looking for .
Tom has a picture he wants to show us .
I &apos;m free .
I don &apos;t know him .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is scared of me .
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him .
Who wrote the book ?
Tom isn &apos;t himself .
Tom pulled something out of his pocket and put it on his desk .
The days are getting longer and longer .
We won &apos;t be doing that .
The family wants to buy a house .
I &apos;d like some coffee .
Everyone can &apos;t afford a car .
Tom &apos;s correct .
Tom wished Mary could &apos;ve gone with him .
It should be possible to change that .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
It &apos;s news to me .
He didn &apos;t come on time .
TV is also not what it used to be .
Is Mary your daughter ?
We know this .
We weren &apos;t lucky .
Asked if he was happy , Tom said that he was .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off Mary .
I want to hear all about your trip to Boston .
I want to know why .
Please take a seat .
We walked here .
Leave us .
We saw her dance .
Women don &apos;t like me .
Now I &apos;m angry .
Tom was happy .
No one knows where we are .
I want this camera .
You must do as you are told .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
It was very hot this afternoon .
I wish I had gone with the others to the game yesterday .
I know Tom isn &apos;t very happy here .
Tom didn &apos;t admit his mistake .
You have to do as I say .
I wonder if this is love .
You would like it .
How long have you been abroad ?
I think Tom might be telling the truth .
You are really very good .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
Are you sick ?
What are these things ?
It &apos;s been a long night .
What kind of person would do that kind of thing ?
Tom knows the truth .
Come on , it &apos;s easy .
I am in the house .
I think you &apos;re going to like this movie .
I know that , Tom .
Tom walked away .
Tom hasn &apos;t decided yet .
There is always something to do .
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I bought this for my girlfriend .
We know what Tom and Mary want .
I &apos;ve thought of that .
Nobody came .
They probably don &apos;t know .
What does that have to do with us ?
I &apos;ll be there right away .
Go home now .
You need to get ready .
Tom spoke to Mary about the matter .
What time did they leave ?
I came here to see Tom .
It &apos;s hot in this room .
I love this song .
I had him fix my watch .
Why did Tom do it ?
This is Mary &apos;s dog .
Why is your French so good ?
We must sleep outside today .
I won !
We know where it is .
It has been raining since yesterday .
Tom came to see us yesterday afternoon .
Tom &apos;s angry .
I &apos;m going to give you one more chance .
I &apos;d be up for that .
We &apos;re going to get married this summer .
Why didn &apos;t you help Tom ?
I want a guitar .
It is nothing to me .
Tom isn &apos;t good at French .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
We &apos;re done here .
The cat sleeps on the table .
Tom was wearing glasses .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
You &apos;ve probably forgotten about it already .
You should go .
I don &apos;t like the coffee .
How long do we have to wait here ?
How long has Tom been gone ?
I know what happened .
You &apos;re the only person who ever comes to visit me .
More coffee , please .
How about another piece of cake ?
Tom let us go .
Tom won &apos;t be coming to our party .
How is it going with your family ?
I didn &apos;t want to dance with Tom .
We don &apos;t need you .
We &apos;ll take it .
I will help you if possible .
I already tried that .
I think Tom is literate .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here today .
You guys are always so busy .
Do you know what that means ?
Why are you so late ?
I hear you , but I don &apos;t see you .
I think he is right .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
Tom says he used to study French .
She was born in America .
What do you usually do on weekends ?
Do you like to be alone ?
Tom is standing right behind you .
You don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
He isn &apos;t happy at all .
We have to tell Tom what has happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t know me .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to do that anymore .
I love you like a son .
Let me drive you home .
I am sure she can have no objection .
Which ones do you like better ?
Tom tried to stay calm .
Can you remember his name ?
How do we do it ?
Were you looking for Tom ?
Tom is going to stop by today .
I &apos;m busy with my homework .
She was very happy with my gift .
I was reading a book .
Tom started taking things out of the box .
I &apos;ve already spoken with Tom .
Which cup is yours ?
I thought Tom and Mary were hungry .
I &apos;m able to swim .
Tom had no idea why Mary wanted to see him .
You cannot do this .
It &apos;s difficult to find work .
I &apos;ll take care of the cat .
She loves Tom more than I do .
He &apos;s too old for me .
He deserves the prize .
We &apos;ve run out of tea .
Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal ?
I can &apos;t remember where I first met Tom .
I hope to see my parents tomorrow .
Tom was married .
Tom is as old as my father .
Tom drove his children to school .
He gave her a book .
Tom said he found his keys .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
I thought we had more time .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
I wonder why Tom said that .
Your French is really quite good .
Come off it !
I &apos;ll try to explain it to the best of my ability .
Tom got out of the car .
I wanna go to Japan .
What are you guys doing here ?
This problem is too difficult for you to solve .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom about his brother John .
I should &apos;ve introduced myself .
Is there some reason why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
There &apos;s something else you need to do before you go home .
How come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
This work is difficult for us .
I &apos;d like to call my parents .
I don &apos;t know how I did it .
You can wait in this room .
I told Tom he wasn &apos;t welcome here .
Tom has something in his suitcase for Mary .
He is putting on weight .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about his feelings .
Everybody likes him .
Can I get a lift back to the city with you ?
He is now at the desk .
I want to visit Tom .
There &apos;s got to be a way .
I &apos;m disappointed in you , Tom .
How much do you want ?
How long did you work for Tom ?
Tom deserved that .
Is there anything for me ?
Are you still there ?
We don &apos;t know each other .
Do you think I don &apos;t know that ?
I didn &apos;t expect you .
I couldn &apos;t believe what I was seeing .
You should try to learn a little French .
Have you read the book yet ?
Tom gave me a ride to the airport .
Did Tom die ?
A fire broke out during that night .
I was so drunk last night .
They &apos;re looking for Tom .
All of the students at school know me .
How long were you gone ?
He couldn &apos;t bring himself to believe her story .
It was almost too good to be true .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
Tom didn &apos;t plan on hurting anyone .
Where did you say this came from ?
I want to know what you think .
Everybody wants to be here .
I &apos;ve already seen that movie .
I want to talk to him about it .
He keeps two cats .
Do you want another one of these ?
We must do it now .
I found your keys .
Tom is still sick in bed .
Did you understand Tom ?
I still don &apos;t see it .
No one believed his story .
If Tom is right , Mary is in Boston now .
Ask Tom not to wait for me .
How &apos;re they doing that ?
You are entitled to your opinion .
There &apos;s something on the table .
Are we ready ?
The kitchen of this house is very large .
Where &apos;s my coat ?
Life is like a journey .
What did you do with them ?
Nobody had any idea what I wanted .
This is very easy .
It &apos;s already been five years since we began to study English .
I had some money stolen yesterday .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
That &apos;s a fish .
I &apos;m not coming .
You surprised everybody .
I want you here tomorrow by 2 : 30 .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
I like women but I don &apos;t get along with them .
Tom is a big boy .
I can &apos;t tell you that yet .
You know how .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to remember Mary .
I &apos;m just as old as Tom is .
It &apos;s not up to you .
Tom isn &apos;t supposed to be eating now .
She gave up everything for her children .
What is going on ?
Is that what you want to do ?
This isn &apos;t over .
Do you know who she is ?
Who is your teacher ?
Do you want me to help you or not ?
What does she have ?
I didn &apos;t like being kept waiting so long .
Children really like playing on the beach .
We need to keep this confidential .
We needed to do that .
Tom looks pretty bad .
Tom isn &apos;t a good person .
Why is it there ?
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
She can speak French .
We should visit Boston again .
What has that to do with me ?
He never listens to what his father says .
I fell asleep .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
It &apos;s not difficult to speak French .
How do you intend to achieve this ?
We never expected this .
I know you want to see Tom .
Can you stay with Tom ?
I didn &apos;t realize what I was doing .
Have you seen Tom &apos;s new apartment ?
What do they do ?
Tom and I want you to come with us .
My watch says 2 : 30 .
Why don &apos;t you do it ?
I tried standing on my head .
I went home by train .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll win .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I &apos;d better go now .
You must tell no one .
She called off the party .
This is all I know .
She is working night and day .
Who &apos;ll look after your dog tomorrow ?
This man loves my sister .
Did you ask your mother ?
I haven &apos;t felt well recently .
I feel better every day .
You may come and see me once a week .
She bought him a car .
It &apos;s not important .
I think you haven &apos;t understood the question .
It &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
I have no one to help me .
He is lying on the bench .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
Tom can talk .
Tom often plays tennis after school .
Tom said he &apos;s not going to do that .
I want a drink .
I didn &apos;t see any children .
It &apos;s not what you say that matters , but how you say it .
I didn &apos;t know about the party .
I hit on an idea .
Where is that ?
In this case , I think he is correct .
We &apos;ll cook .
Why can &apos;t animals talk ?
I &apos;m glad you guys are still here .
I just couldn &apos;t do it .
You &apos;d better tell him the truth .
You sound like your mother .
Thanks for the flowers .
Tom told me he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
Tom gave Mary the key .
Tom became a doctor .
All I want is you .
Tom gave everything he had .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom again .
You didn &apos;t eat much lunch , did you ?
I know what Tom is like .
What sort of person does something like that ?
We have lots of work to do .
Tom made me do the work .
Tom is scared of Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
She is good at playing tennis .
Tom comes home at around six .
How are you these days ?
I think it &apos;s good .
Tom blames you for the death of his wife .
I &apos;m still in love with you .
Is Tom in Boston ?
Tom saw me give Mary some money .
I will give you anything you want .
How can you help Tom ?
Tom told me that his father had passed away .
My English is anything but good .
Maybe it &apos;s not too late .
We lost our cat and Tom found it for us .
Tom is a little crazy .
I don &apos;t know anyone who likes Tom .
I saw him with my own eyes .
I told Tom that the party wouldn &apos;t be much fun .
Tom came home very late last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here in Boston .
Now you &apos;ve hurt my feelings .
I want to go abroad .
She has a few friends .
Are you tired ?
I know Tom has gone to Boston .
When are you busy ?
It &apos;s work .
I can &apos;t help Tom with that .
It &apos;s you that she loves , not me .
Why don &apos;t you just go home ?
It has to stop .
Tom stepped off the train .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
This coat doesn &apos;t fit me .
I think I might be in Boston next Monday .
He really likes music a lot .
I have to wait .
I bought a new television .
Tom talks about Boston a lot .
I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s after 2 : 30 .
Tom found one .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
I have to get to Tom .
Tom was suddenly very happy .
Tom and Mary will keep their promise .
What do you have in your suitcase ?
I have an idea what it is .
I &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
Where is Tom sleeping ?
You know very well how it happened .
You should go home .
What time &apos;s your train ?
I hope it &apos;s true .
What do you think of my plan ?
Mary is my girlfriend .
They didn &apos;t even know how to write their own names .
She went home .
Tom arrived too early .
Her son has her eyes .
He should have done that long ago .
We &apos;re kidding .
You had better learn either English or French .
Everybody saw it .
I need you .
This dog isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
Let go of me !
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Australia .
Do you know what it was ?
All of my children were born in Boston .
You &apos;ll do fine .
What kind of flowers do you like ?
Tom is a yes-man .
The way you &apos;re doing it is wrong .
Do you have a car ?
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
Tom &apos;s not asleep .
Did you see your friends last week ?
I don &apos;t like it at all .
She is not home , but at school .
I don &apos;t know whether he &apos;ll come by train or by car .
The first few years were difficult .
He ran out of money .
I believe in you .
Everyone wants what they can &apos;t have .
I want to see that again .
Tom told Mary that she could do whatever she liked .
What did you tell Tom ?
I know exactly what Tom was doing .
I &apos;m not going to explain it to you .
We tried .
What made you think Tom did that ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
I want to live in the city .
I understand French .
How many books do you have ?
Everything that Tom said is true .
This book is too expensive .
What does he mean to do ?
It &apos;s too short .
She works in a bank .
Let &apos;s ask him .
If you ever need a job , come see me .
I am a good boy .
I can &apos;t eat all this .
How many times has Tom done that this month ?
I know that Tom hurt you .
I want to meet people and have fun .
He died five years ago .
Today I turn four years old .
I feel like going to the movies , but I still have to do my homework .
It doesn &apos;t matter what he said .
Nobody does that .
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t think John did that with Alice .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
Tom was all alone in the house .
I think I can handle this myself .
You should ask Tom yourself .
Tom wants you .
I have to think of my children .
Tom is the one who was taken to the hospital .
Tom was hot .
I &apos;ll give these to Tom .
I &apos;m here for you , Tom .
I love it here .
It &apos;ll be finished in a day or two .
Please give me some water .
They gave it to me .
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .
Tom wanted to talk to me about something .
Tom kept running .
Tom is standing in front of Mary .
The dictionary on the desk is Tom &apos;s .
They &apos;ve been at it for hours .
Tom is going to love it here .
I see a boy .
She needs it .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will come .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
That &apos;s not what I said at all .
How rich are they ?
Was that all you saw ?
Is it too big ?
I want to talk to him about it .
Let &apos;s try once again .
My opinion really doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;ll study your report .
What is good for you is good for me .
There must be something else to drink .
He is still too young for the job .
Tom and Mary were here .
Tom only does what he has to do .
Where &apos;s Tom from ?
Thank you for remembering my birthday .
I only have ten books .
Tom listened to what Mary was saying .
Tom studied French for three hours last night .
He likes reading books .
I &apos;m angry with her .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom wear a hat .
Tom must have seen me .
You live and learn .
They &apos;re coming here .
I need to be sure .
Say you &apos;re sorry .
Where can I get the airport bus ?
Tom and Mary have the same opinion .
Tom has poor eyesight .
I always take a bus .
It &apos;s almost six o &apos;clock .
Some friends invited me to dinner .
There &apos;ll be coffee and cake at five .
It &apos;s getting hot here in Boston .
I got here as fast as I could .
I want you all to stay with me .
He stood there with his hat on .
Tom tried to answer the question .
I just found out about it .
Tom has to finish this work by 2 : 30 .
I know where the money is .
Tom says he can &apos;t stay long .
It won &apos;t happen again .
You should help your father .
They &apos;re proud of me .
He &apos;s not ready .
This is the last time I &apos;ll ask you to do anything for me .
Go ahead .
It was a good decision .
It is impossible for me to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen talking to you .
They &apos;ve still got Tom .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
You don &apos;t know my brother .
If I were rich , I would go abroad .
Why is Tom even here ?
I came here yesterday .
Won &apos;t you stay for tea ?
I &apos;m happy with this .
I &apos;d like to live in Australia .
We &apos;ll all be dead in thirty years .
We are not hiring anymore .
Tom rarely wears a hat .
Don &apos;t make me angry . You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry .
Where did you leave your bike ?
I would rather you hadn &apos;t told him the truth .
I hate people who talk like that .
We &apos;re here for you .
Do you know what &apos;s going on there ?
He runs .
Where do you want to go ?
I just want to dance .
I said I &apos;m fine .
What did you have for supper last night ?
There has always been war and there always will be .
Tom didn &apos;t know how to help Mary .
He &apos;s still alive .
Those men are speaking French .
I know how to do that .
Tom seemed busy .
We &apos;re not ready to order yet .
I can &apos;t wait to go on a vacation .
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father .
Tom is deeply in love with Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
Do you believe that people are capable of change ?
Tom stayed in the hotel .
There are hardly any books in this room .
What languages do you know ?
French is difficult to learn .
Tom drove away .
Did you understand me ?
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t help ?
I don &apos;t like Tom .
Do you know who this car here belongs to ?
I like Boston .
If she were here now , I would tell her the truth .
Tom hasn &apos;t bought a new pair of shoes in three years .
This question is difficult to answer .
She said she had been happy .
I &apos;ll be outside if you need me .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s Mary &apos;s boyfriend , but Mary thinks that he &apos;s just a friend .
I made him do so .
I hope that you will like it .
Young people like his books .
It is none of your business .
Tomorrow &apos;s my birthday .
Do you have any idea what &apos;s wrong ?
I know quite a few people who don &apos;t eat meat .
How do we get out of this situation ?
Tom might wait .
It isn &apos;t good .
Tom is the only one here who doesn &apos;t know Mary .
My sister is three years old .
I don &apos;t know if it is true .
Are you tall ?
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom has to look after his mother .
No one lives in this house anymore .
That looks good on you .
Thanks for taking the time to help .
He said that he wanted some money .
That &apos;s broken .
You look like Tom .
She became happy .
What else do you know ?
Give some meat to the dog .
I always wanted a dog .
I don &apos;t care what she eats .
I think Tom forgot his camera .
Will Tom be here this afternoon ?
I hate to lose .
Go find out .
We don &apos;t know where to go .
Is that your mother ?
He &apos;s interested in you .
I &apos;m happy with it .
After you , Tom .
Tom said that he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s hard to please Tom .
Everyone loves their father .
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
Which is your bag ?
Tom left an hour ago .
If Tom can do it , I &apos;m sure I can do it , too .
Tom thought Mary was stupid .
She likes to go to the beach .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
How long was Tom in the water ?
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday .
Tom was there for me when I needed him .
Are you sure ?
I &apos;m very contented .
I hope you know that , Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me before ?
The tea is too strong . Add some water .
This is not important .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t help Mary .
If you want , you can go .
Why not come with me ?
Do you want me to go home ?
Tom can &apos;t do everything himself .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
We &apos;ll never know .
What kind of book did you buy ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is happy .
Listen to Tom .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
You know this .
It &apos;s for us .
Tom said he didn &apos;t learn anything at school today .
Tom knows where to find me if he needs me .
Tom loves children .
I came here to learn French .
You know what I want , don &apos;t you ?
Come and see me whenever it is convenient for you .
Don &apos;t come here anymore .
It serves you right .
Why did you buy flowers ?
Tom was fast .
Tom is back .
You shouldn &apos;t go to school .
Are we alone ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a new pair of glasses .
They never did anything .
We could do our homework together .
You don &apos;t keep your promises .
Aren &apos;t you going to do it ?
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a new bicycle .
I have to be here all night .
Tom has left .
Maybe Tom is sick .
She lives in an apartment alone .
We went to Boston .
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle .
I really hope so .
I think what you say is true .
Are you home , too ?
Tom wanted to work .
It is just five o &apos;clock .
I already told you that .
Tom is playing with his son .
Is your dad here ?
Make Tom pay for what he did .
I &apos;ll go look for Tom .
I had a good idea .
Today is my little sister &apos;s birthday .
Tom went back to prison .
Tom is feeling a little better today .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
I dislike being alone .
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
I &apos;m not very good at it .
Tom returned from Australia yesterday .
Anyone can write his own name .
You &apos;re both crazy .
The girl wanted to tell him the truth , but she couldn &apos;t .
I &apos;d like to sing a song .
I want an answer from you ASAP .
My father does not always walk to work .
Can you stay a bit longer ?
You like English , don &apos;t you ?
Who has it ?
I &apos;m scared of Tom &apos;s dog .
She can speak French .
I have lots of time .
Tom asked Mary for help .
You &apos;re the only friend I have .
We don &apos;t get out much .
Everything is now ready for you .
Have you decided what you &apos;ll do ?
Tom knows what happened .
Are those guys your friends ?
Tom shook everybody &apos;s hands .
The man is all but dead .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
He can be proud of his father .
Do you want to dance ?
Tom has his kid with him .
You &apos;re really not supposed to be here .
May I have a word with you in private ?
Tell your friends .
I don &apos;t like beer that much .
Don &apos;t worry about me .
If only I &apos;d done my homework !
I got back home earlier than I thought I would .
I &apos;m not leaving until tomorrow .
I &apos;ll call him .
Tom used to bring me here to swim when I was younger .
You &apos;ll be fine .
I &apos;d love to get one of those .
Are you rich ?
This is the big one .
I &apos;m still not talking to you .
You always were good at your job .
I prefer coffee .
I &apos;ve finished reading that book .
Tom tried to answer the question .
Your students don &apos;t like me .
Tom can speak French .
What do you think happened here ?
Our parents are friends .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
Tom can cook very well .
I should &apos;ve been ready .
I &apos;m taking this one .
I have a daughter that goes to school with Tom .
I &apos;ll tell you .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
Tom wanted to know everything about you .
This shouldn &apos;t take too long .
She met him this morning .
Who &apos;s after you ?
He told me that he would see it once more .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
Mary is Tom &apos;s only daughter .
Do you believe him ?
That &apos;s my problem with Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t my son .
Tom asked Mary if she spoke more than three languages .
This is where the accident happened .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
Tom has something he wants to say .
You &apos;ve made me very happy .
He found it .
It &apos;s up to us .
Give that to him .
Does Tom have a key to Mary &apos;s apartment ?
I got into town only a week ago .
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
I &apos;m watching TV now .
You &apos;re killing me .
You &apos;re not going to do that , are you ?
These glasses aren &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
This is her house .
How tall you are !
He put on his coat and left the house .
Who told you I would help you ?
I really want to know what &apos;s happening here .
I wrote more today than yesterday .
I have no money with me .
Can &apos;t you speak French ?
My dog is almost half the size of yours .
I did not play tennis yesterday .
It &apos;s your home .
I am happy to have so many good friends .
Has Tom ever asked you to help him ?
Your secret will be safe with me .
How long have you guys known each other ?
I wasn &apos;t on time for school this morning .
Tom looks very happy .
Tom seems to be busy all the time .
I don &apos;t want to die alone .
What kind of play is it ?
Don &apos;t ask Tom . He doesn &apos;t know anything .
Tom makes more money than his parents .
You &apos;re too stupid to live .
We &apos;ve got to be ready in thirty minutes .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Tom knows Australia well .
Tom asked to be driven home .
Today I love the entire world .
I didn &apos;t eat anything for six days .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
Tom is good at doing that , isn &apos;t he ?
There &apos;s still a lot left .
I don &apos;t like this weather .
Tom would like to see you .
Your hair is beautiful .
All my friends do it .
Come and see me on Sunday next week .
Tom didn &apos;t get everything he wanted .
Would you like another piece of pie ?
I know it &apos;s none of my business .
Tom didn &apos;t need my help .
Tom knows he &apos;s not supposed to help Mary do that .
We all want you to be happy .
I like Tom &apos;s plan better than Mary &apos;s plan .
I asked Tom where he and Mary had first met each other .
There is a big park near my school .
I thought I was dead .
Tom says he &apos;s in love with Mary .
I want you with me .
You might want to sit down . This is going to take a while .
I think that Tom and Mary are in trouble .
We &apos;re here for Tom .
I think he has done it .
Am I talking to myself ?
I am going to buy a new car .
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t like it .
Tom couldn &apos;t take it any longer .
Any of you can do it .
I don &apos;t feel like doing it .
She lost her father at the age of 3 .
Tom is in the kitchen .
They will understand .
I have known her for two years .
Tom looked like he was terrified .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
I &apos;m quite wealthy .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at it .
I &apos;ve never heard of him .
She &apos;s a lot older than he is .
I hope Tom didn &apos;t take it too hard .
Tom is nervous , too .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Everyone &apos;s saying it .
We &apos;re having a lot of fun .
This isn &apos;t about you .
She lives alone in this room .
Tom said that he &apos;d had nothing to do with what had happened .
What wasn &apos;t easy ?
I don &apos;t want to scare you .
I still love Mary .
Don &apos;t do it !
Did Tom tell you who his wife is ?
It &apos;s really Tom .
You &apos;re safe now .
Sunday is the first day of the week .
Tom already knew what to do .
I will have to study tomorrow .
I have already eaten lunch .
I came for you .
He died yesterday .
I &apos;ve got kids .
Tom is good at French .
You need a lot of water .
Tom was driving .
I am here .
How soon can we get started ?
I need to get to this meeting now .
When I was your age , I had a job .
The letter was written by Tom .
Tom can &apos;t buy what he wants to buy because he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I found no money left in my pocket .
I don &apos;t like your boss .
I &apos;m going to go there .
They say that she &apos;ll get married soon .
You &apos;ll die out there .
How hard would it be to do that ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
Tom said that he was worried about his future .
I am very pleased with my new house .
I knew we would be friends .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
I don &apos;t want to cause any problems .
Stand back , please .
What &apos;s that building at the back of the hospital ?
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary .
Tom is holding a cup of coffee .
Who did you come with ?
I asked you not to go there .
Tom told me he wanted to quit the company .
Tom has something to do with the case .
I wonder where Tom is now .
What don &apos;t you like about your job ?
That &apos;s it .
Nobody understands us .
Tom goes to school .
Where did you see Tom ?
Mary isn &apos;t my sister .
When is he coming back ?
I could help you with that .
I love her and she loves me .
Tom and Mary have been best of friends for years .
Come here quickly .
Tom often drives too fast .
She earns 30 dollars per day .
Where have you been , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Let Tom do it .
He tried to open the window .
I don &apos;t know anyone in Boston .
She asked him to marry her .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
Look what I made for you .
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday .
Tom almost didn &apos;t catch the bus .
This movie is frightening to the children .
Let &apos;s go to the beach .
Tom bought something for Mary .
You can &apos;t defeat me .
Do you want this job ?
I don &apos;t want to cook .
His eyes widened .
Tom is arriving soon . You should get ready .
Tom wants one .
We both know that .
Don &apos;t give Tom what he wants .
We can pay .
Tom has been living alone for a long time .
Where are our children ?
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
Any one of us could do it .
What &apos;s wrong with you two ?
Let me speak to Tom first .
I want you to be nice to Tom .
I can &apos;t do what you want .
I wish I was dead .
Are you sure you really don &apos;t need anything ?
They &apos;re my books .
I &apos;ve got a proposition for you .
I should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
How long do I have to stay ?
Tom is wounded .
You &apos;re with friends .
You are too young to be in love .
You &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
I &apos;m not certain , but I think so .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom has one , too .
He has two boys and a girl .
That &apos;s very big .
I don &apos;t feel well today .
Please think about the problem .
How long does this train stop there ?
Let me do that .
Why didn &apos;t I think of that ?
I can go .
I had lunch with Tom .
I like watching TV .
Your suitcase is too heavy .
Are you alive ?
I &apos;m afraid for you .
I did exactly what you told me to do .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
Did you speak to Tom about this ?
I think that Tom can swim fairly well .
Tom seemed to be somewhat disappointed .
I will give you whatever you want .
There are people in the park .
When are we eating ? I &apos;m hungry !
You should go home . It &apos;s getting late .
Tom got back in his car and drove away .
Those flowers are beautiful .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what he needs to do .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
I need you to come with me .
I need you to drive me to the station .
Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep .
I know you have to go back to Boston .
I &apos;m having fun .
I had no clue .
I don &apos;t know who can do that and who can &apos;t .
Would you like to eat something else ?
Tom was here , too .
I &apos;ve never been spoken to like that .
Let &apos;s sing a song .
It seems that Tom might win .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s voice .
I believe we can get that done .
I &apos;ll be happy to do it .
Tom can speak French , too .
I have good eyesight .
This is too good to be true .
What are you doing tonight ?
You &apos;re only deceiving yourself .
I &apos;m the only one who stayed awake all night .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
Who are you to tell me what I need ?
Tom had to stay in the hospital for a week .
Tom knows exactly what he wants .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t likely to do that .
I hope it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
She needs to sleep more .
Tom always thinks about others .
I can &apos;t hear a word Tom is saying .
They aren &apos;t hungry .
Tom should be studying French now .
You can stay till tonight .
Hand it to Tom .
I can &apos;t remember who I gave it to .
I expect Tom will win .
Tom needs you here .
Tom can &apos;t rely on Mary &apos;s help .
Tom is able to say &quot; I can only speak French &quot; in thirty languages .
I like all of them .
I want to get to know you .
You can &apos;t blame this on us .
They are my old friends .
You &apos;re used to that , aren &apos;t you ?
My father usually comes home at six .
What happened to my car ?
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can .
I &apos;ll give you a new one .
What do they want us to do ?
It &apos;s time to go back home .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
I have nothing else to lose .
Do as he tells you .
Tom has a crush on you .
You can do that tomorrow .
You could never do that .
What do you do in Japan ?
You can believe me .
I ate too much yesterday .
I used to do that as a kid .
We both saw you .
He doesn &apos;t understand me .
Everybody is alive .
I knew you would come .
I &apos;m not feeling too great .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know how to do it .
I did nothing .
I wish that you hadn &apos;t told me that .
Are you still at home ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
They got along very well .
Would you help me look for my keys ?
You must be crazy .
Was that fun to do ?
Tom wasn &apos;t ready .
I had intended to go , but I forgot to .
We are happy to see you again .
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
Haven &apos;t we learned anything ?
Why do you want to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat .
Tell Tom I &apos;m ready .
Playing the piano isn &apos;t easy .
Is the road all right to drive on ?
Has something happened ?
Why isn &apos;t that good ?
You &apos;re making me nervous .
Tom bought a car .
Tom knows it .
I &apos;ve only had one girlfriend .
I can hardly swim .
I really am very busy .
Where does she live now ?
I &apos;ve finished reading that book .
Nobody knows what has become of her .
I don &apos;t know what has become of the hatchling .
Why are you helping Tom ?
He &apos;ll come on foot or by bicycle .
Tom looks good for his age .
My mother can &apos;t drive a car .
You don &apos;t know them .
I &apos;ve just finished reading that book .
I &apos;m tempted to just stay in bed .
You won &apos;t die today .
There &apos;s something I need to ask you .
Give me your phone .
I don &apos;t like it any more than you do .
Tom will see Mary today .
Any of you can do it .
You could have been happy .
We understand that .
Tom eats slowly .
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
Tom has told us a lot about you .
I think we should &apos;ve discussed this .
What &apos;s Tom do ?
Which is your guitar ?
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents ?
He knows how to swim .
You can tell me the truth .
I want to run .
I think I have a right to know .
This is really important .
I &apos;ve never seen anybody die .
I think I have the best job in the world .
It made me forget about my problems .
Hurry ! We don &apos;t have a lot of time .
Do you think it would be possible for us to do that ?
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s younger sister .
Tom is from Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s what I saw .
Can this wait until tomorrow ?
I &apos;m used to staying up late .
Are we just friends ?
He can &apos;t read .
Are they still here ?
I lost sight of my friends .
His story is true .
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog .
Tom ran back across the street .
Do it yourself .
You have to leave Boston .
These are my students .
I don &apos;t know anything about him .
He cannot have been there yesterday .
I didn &apos;t ask you to help me .
We &apos;re here to have fun .
These books are very old .
She was surprised that it was that late .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Do you really think I wouldn &apos;t help you ?
They say he is very rich .
Tom says he is rich .
We want to help you .
I want to know how Tom thinks .
Tell her that I am preparing dinner .
I have a girlfriend .
He never saw his father again .
Have any of you seen Tom ?
You may go anywhere you like .
I don &apos;t want to drink that .
Tom and Mary still love each other .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to talk about that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
When is Tom &apos;s birthday ?
The sun is setting .
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary &apos;s birthday was .
I &apos;m not sleepy .
Nobody can help you .
Here is your key .
Tom also speaks French .
I know how important this is to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t do anything .
What would happen if you didn &apos;t do what Tom told you to ?
That &apos;ll be good .
This is good coffee .
Do you know when she will come ?
What is this ?
They didn &apos;t have enough money .
I have a message for Tom .
What are you sorry about ?
Did Tom tell you that ?
Which did you eat , fish or meat ?
We must stay perfectly calm .
Tom likes to go to the beach .
I was at the party .
I think Tom and Mary like each other .
You shouldn &apos;t have come alone .
I received a letter in French last week .
I hope Tom didn &apos;t take that too hard .
I think you should swim .
Tom isn &apos;t running .
I love flowers .
Tom showed us around the city .
I love walking on the beach .
You don &apos;t seem to care what happens .
Tom said that he had been hungry .
I &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
The meeting was almost over .
You must go to school .
There &apos;s too much I don &apos;t know .
I think you &apos;re completely right .
Tom was in Australia last month , wasn &apos;t he ?
I have something else to show you .
Tom may come today .
I love being right .
I never heard him sing .
Her life is in danger .
It seems that no one knows the truth .
We don &apos;t need your help .
Tom became very busy .
I want to see what happens .
I don &apos;t like those people .
Tom won &apos;t forget this .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
It &apos;ll be there .
Do you have everything ?
I never think about it anymore .
Tom went into the bank .
If Tom goes , I will , too .
He doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
He talks well .
Tom says that he didn &apos;t study at all for the test .
I hardly see you anymore .
I wonder why Tom is unmarried .
I like this . I &apos;ll take it .
Tom bought some flowers for Mary .
Do you know what happiness is ?
Tom told Mary that he loved Alice .
You &apos;re in love .
Tom asked me if I was all right .
I &apos;ve always liked the outdoors .
If you tell people what they want to hear , they &apos;ll do what you want .
He has a bicycle .
Where were you when Tom needed help ?
Neither of us can speak French .
Did that surprise you ?
Let Tom come .
What about this dress ?
I don &apos;t really know why he wrote the book .
It is cold today .
I &apos;m not so sure .
She reads a great deal .
You may go .
Tom bought a car .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s always right .
I tried hard .
I &apos;m sorry , but Tom isn &apos;t home .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see us .
I think Tom liked it .
Tom said that .
It doesn &apos;t matter what I think .
Who is your teacher ?
That would appear to be correct .
I don &apos;t mean you .
I have no money on me .
Tom isn &apos;t a good student .
You &apos;ll meet Tom .
Look at that house .
This box is filled with apples .
I know that Tom is from Boston .
Where can I find him ?
Tom is as big as I am .
What &apos;s in your pocket ?
Where was he born ?
I stayed home all day .
Tom &apos;s hurt .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
Tom came with Mary .
How did you get into the house ?
Tom said we should start early .
You have to study more .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be of more help .
The child fell out of bed .
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
Do you really want me to do that ?
You aren &apos;t alone .
His book is very interesting .
I don &apos;t care what you say .
Tom has come to Boston .
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever wait for anybody .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has a bicycle or not .
He can &apos;t do it .
I can &apos;t tell you any more about it .
Who has it now ?
Is there anybody who can drive a car ?
I think I speak French very well .
Your coat is very beautiful .
You have to tell me the truth .
They say it &apos;s very good .
She went there to swim .
That doesn &apos;t concern you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it &apos;ll happen , but he &apos;s pretty sure that it will happen .
I &apos;m bad at tennis .
I &apos;ve got no time for that .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d understand .
I don &apos;t like what you &apos;re doing .
I &apos;m proud of my school .
Tom lives only an hour away .
Tom was unkind .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about what other people think .
He gave his camera to his friend .
This is not important .
Somebody called .
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
She was fond of talking about herself .
Do you have a phone ?
You should keep your promise .
Tell them not to leave without me .
I can see it in your eyes .
Tom said it was none of my business .
I love being with Tom .
I &apos;m looking forward to doing this again .
That &apos;ll be hard to explain .
Tom was late for dinner .
I &apos;d rather go to Boston .
Tom works at a bank .
Tom saw Mary with another man .
This never happened .
Let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
What did he ask you ?
Tom still studies French .
All of us are happy .
I &apos;m getting good at this .
I &apos;ll be home alone all night .
I would like a glass of water .
His advice didn &apos;t help much .
I played tennis with Tom yesterday .
She looked happy in her new dress .
Is that really important ?
I can &apos;t see well .
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow .
I visited her on Sunday morning .
Where did you get the idea ?
I asked my friend for advice .
I want you to go there .
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon .
Can you solve this problem ?
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
I have the right to say what I think .
We &apos;ve got enough .
I may have hurt his feelings .
Tom said he wanted to help .
Everybody wants to be here .
Tom is taking a few days off .
Let me know when you need me again .
I &apos;ll buy that old clock no matter how expensive it is .
She gave a cat some milk .
I must get back to work .
Tom only does what he has to do .
He was listening to the music in his room .
Tom is as tall as you .
I can &apos;t find the knife .
This is what I &apos;ve always wanted to do .
Tom asked Mary to tell him about the house she had lived in when she was a child .
You always say that .
You must go at once .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to do .
Everything is over .
Do you know what that is ?
I can &apos;t remember what this is called .
Tom dislikes me .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
I remember having seen this movie before .
Nobody knows that better than you .
Maybe you &apos;ll succeed .
You don &apos;t really want to remain here , do you ?
I &apos;ll let you know when it has been decided .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
I love her sister very much .
Where is the nearest restaurant ?
Tom didn &apos;t need to come so early .
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
I first met him three years ago .
I want to be young again .
An uncle of mine is a doctor .
Tom wasn &apos;t busy .
That seems simple enough .
You don &apos;t have to answer this question .
The little girl doesn &apos;t like to wear shoes .
Tom has a lot of money .
I couldn &apos;t walk .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know the truth .
Do you know what I like ?
We &apos;re out of tea .
I have lost the key .
You &apos;d better consult your doctor .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you so soon .
Do you have two books ?
I know Tom is over thirty .
Tom was just looking for you .
Don &apos;t be too hard on me .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Your family needs you .
Does Tom have it ?
What is your name ?
Tom and Mary looked at each other through the window .
He knows a lot about animals .
I need to ask you some questions .
They are busy .
My friends are all married .
Tom probably took it .
We don &apos;t have all the time in the world .
I really have to go .
I disagree with you .
I had no idea you could dance .
She stopped talking .
I like milk and bread .
When did you go to London ?
I &apos;m kind of happy .
She plays the piano very well .
Tom is out on an errand .
My birthday is coming soon .
I like Tom a lot , you know .
We &apos;ve done what we can to help .
The light doesn &apos;t work .
I can &apos;t remember any of it .
I &apos;m thinking of going .
I &apos;m angry with Tom .
I should tell Tom to try it .
Where are the knives ?
I can &apos;t play this piece .
Tom said that he would come .
Tom won &apos;t be here till 2 : 30 .
I was hungry and so I asked Tom to make me something to eat .
Could you do that for me ?
I was your age once .
Where are your friends going ?
I know how much you love Tom .
Tom can &apos;t know the truth .
Tom gave it a try .
I would like to hear your opinion .
It &apos;s time for me to be on my way .
What do you think I think ?
That &apos;s not what Tom meant .
I thought that he was a doctor .
I still haven &apos;t heard from him .
I &apos;m not going to Boston .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
He will be free tomorrow .
She stopped talking .
It is necessary for you to start at once .
Let me hear it .
I want to visit you .
Tom was born on a ship .
I think it won &apos;t rain this afternoon .
It was all for nothing .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with Tom .
Everything depends on what you will do .
That was a very good speech .
I need to show you something .
Tom is working on your car .
This is never going to end .
You should have come to us .
Tom did that very well .
He should have worked harder .
I don &apos;t have as many friends as Tom .
Do you really think Tom will help us ?
Where is your house ?
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Life is enjoyable .
Is everybody ready ?
I gave you my answer already .
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
Tom isn &apos;t as strong as I am .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend anymore .
All of the students were present .
I &apos;m glad that I &apos;m not paying .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
We didn &apos;t play well .
Tom hasn &apos;t called .
What did he do to my meat ?
This is my mother .
There &apos;s been a lot of rain this summer .
Tom went to the hospital .
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
Nobody wants you to do this .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
Where did you hear that ?
Don &apos;t say such things .
Tom took a look around the room .
She was busy doing her homework .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
I haven &apos;t decided yet .
My mother is against smoking .
I lost track of time .
Who &apos;s quitting ?
You can rely on her .
He can play the guitar .
You sure can run fast .
I missed the train .
Where did you get that shirt ?
I &apos;m not sure that I can swim that far .
I don &apos;t have that .
Tom said Mary is very tired .
I lost my job on Monday .
Where are they taking Tom ?
What am I going to say ?
Please turn on the TV .
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all do that .
Did Tom eat this morning ?
Are you out of work ?
I think Tom is here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where it is .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
It &apos;s my job to help people like you .
Where does your grandpa live ?
Tom and Mary were walking side by side .
I like this .
Someone is coming .
Tom never thought of the future .
Why &apos;s Tom doing that ?
I &apos;d like to study French , but I don &apos;t have the time .
Why can &apos;t you go now ?
Many parents think it &apos;s important for their children to learn how to speak French .
Are we safe ?
I don &apos;t look like that .
Tom has a new car .
Tom is only a couple of years older than Mary .
Where are those people from ?
I have a boyfriend .
Does that make you happy ?
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
Where &apos;s my shirt ?
Do you have it ?
I should &apos;ve let Tom win .
He wasn &apos;t even there .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Have you read all of these books ?
You &apos;re three hours late .
Tom didn &apos;t even help Mary .
You &apos;ve been really helpful .
I asked Tom to come see me .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
He is two years older than you .
They look busy .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
I just wanted to ask a question .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
I don &apos;t want you with me .
It &apos;s raining there .
I think we can do that .
You must stay awake .
What were you doing out here ?
Tom and I went to school together .
No one asked for your help .
Tom works in Boston .
Her plan seems to be better than mine .
I would like to tell you something .
Have you already read this book ?
He didn &apos;t keep his promise that he would telephone me soon .
I don &apos;t want to meet Tom .
I can &apos;t tell you their names .
Please tell me the truth .
We played together every day when we were kids .
Why did you come early ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
Take these with you .
Have you ever lost ?
We &apos;re just good friends .
I really can &apos;t understand it .
It &apos;s started again .
I thought you would say that .
I can &apos;t wait for him any longer .
Tom went on doing what he was doing .
Mary is a good girl .
The children were so noisy that I couldn &apos;t study .
I &apos;m really sorry everything happened the way it did .
Tom is in Australia already .
We have a few questions for you .
Maybe I should write Tom a letter .
There &apos;s no one by that name here .
This hat is too big for you .
Where is your money ?
Tom likes snow .
Where do I know you from ?
We just can &apos;t stand each other .
I ran out of money .
Would you like anything else ?
I think Tom will like that .
No one loves you .
Friends are very important .
It &apos;s none of your business .
Do you enjoy it ?
She called off the party .
Have you seen this man ?
I like dogs more than cats .
Tom lives in Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
Look at that building .
I don &apos;t like the way Tom writes .
Tom looks like he &apos;s a bit tired .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
I think they know you .
Judging from what everyone says , it &apos;s the truth .
Tom and I both don &apos;t understand French at all .
You don &apos;t need to go there .
I didn &apos;t feel cold .
I just wanted to say that I love you .
I wonder why Tom bought that .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
He likes taking a walk by himself .
Why are you always talking about Tom ?
You needn &apos;t have taken a taxi .
I returned from abroad .
What you say is true .
Did you call me up last night ?
I didn &apos;t want anything to do with Tom .
Why did he do that ?
I am married .
Give it back to me .
Tom and Mary both have very few friends .
I don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
Why are we really here ?
That &apos;s what I have to do .
I no longer want that .
Tom ran to school .
Tom is his brother .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in over a week .
The problem is not what he said , but how he said it .
I know what I have to do .
Keep an eye on my bag for a while .
I just didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom got a job .
Tom asked me to give this to you .
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday .
What was Tom &apos;s response ?
He will do anything to make money .
I like studying languages .
I &apos;m as tall as he is .
That can &apos;t be helped .
I &apos;m disappointed that he &apos;s not here .
Tom asked me to speak to you .
Thanks for the advice .
Tom doesn &apos;t even read the newspaper .
No one else was in the room .
I &apos;m sorry I let you down .
Who &apos;s older , you or Tom ?
I &apos;m happy Tom is doing OK .
What do you want anyway ?
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French ?
If you don &apos;t like Tom , just try to avoid him .
We &apos;ll go with you .
I don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen .
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary .
I just got a letter from my girl .
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
You &apos;re old .
Tom is helping me .
I have a friend who loves me .
I &apos;m going to speak to Tom .
Tom died at the hospital .
You may not be right .
Do you think you &apos;ll ever get married again ?
Tom still has many things to do .
Is somebody there ?
I like the sun .
Hold on to it .
I still haven &apos;t found work .
There &apos;s so much I want to show you .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
The book is too expensive .
Tom is three years old .
I come from Australia .
Tom said that he &apos;d go to Boston .
Tom met a girl about his age .
She is , if anything , a little better today than yesterday .
She speaks English really well .
We &apos;re not doing that .
Tell me what you want me to do .
How long can you stay ?
Is this your book ?
Tom tried his luck .
Listen , I have to go .
You &apos;re worried .
The shop is just in front of the station .
I &apos;m thirty now .
They don &apos;t want Tom there .
Everybody thinks Tom is a bit crazy .
I thought I &apos;d give Tom your phone number .
Tom said that he thought that he &apos;d be able to do that today .
Tom can &apos;t be sick .
Is Tom better than Mary ?
I really enjoyed the party .
He is proud of his son .
Tom is home now .
Does Tom have one ?
Tom may not like what he sees .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
Who were you there with ?
Tom told me what you did .
I &apos;m supposed to see Tom .
I can &apos;t answer that question .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
Thanks for the meal .
Tom must be hungry .
They are all dead .
Everyone &apos;s waiting .
Let me speak to Tom first .
I saw this coming .
Do you want a drink ?
Tom doesn &apos;t allow people to enter his house .
I &apos;d like you to meet my sister , Mary .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
He &apos;s on his last legs .
I don &apos;t get it .
I dislike them all .
How are you , Tom ?
I can &apos;t take you to work with me .
Tom is arriving soon . You should get ready .
I hope it &apos;s not true .
Tom will be ready .
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes ?
Please tell me how to do that .
What good do you think that &apos;ll do ?
What &apos;s Tom standing there for ?
I feel much better today .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
I wonder who that girl is .
Tom is correct .
Do you know what &apos;s become of Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t allowed to go there .
Did you steal it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to work .
Come at two o &apos;clock .
Tom looked at the ground .
If Tom had asked me for some money , I &apos;d have given it to him .
Are these ours ?
She is nothing but a child .
He gave me food and money as well .
I &apos;m not sure Tom is willing to help us .
We are free from danger .
You can &apos;t swim here .
Tom left a few minutes early .
Aren &apos;t you from Australia ?
Go when you want .
I &apos;ll give you five minutes to work out this problem .
Do you have a bike ?
Tom knew this would happen .
I know you have it with you .
I know where you can find Tom .
Tom is married and has three children .
You had better stop smoking .
I don &apos;t want to go .
Did you telephone him ?
Tom seemed to have many friends .
Tom gave Mary his telephone number .
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes ?
Now I understand it all .
I &apos;ll get another job .
Give me a few .
Is it money you want ?
Don &apos;t talk to me like I &apos;m a child .
Will you let Tom do that ?
I don &apos;t want it .
Tom has a really nice voice .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money .
I love Mary .
Tom expected it .
You can &apos;t fix it . You should buy a new one .
Maybe Tom will know what to do .
I gave Mary a book .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he comes home .
I &apos;ll go and ask Tom .
This table takes up too much space .
I didn &apos;t like it .
She needs to help him .
I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s quite true .
You &apos;ve disappointed us .
We &apos;re not going to stop here .
Tom showed me his phone .
Tom rose to go .
We &apos;ll all die sooner or later .
Tom may eat whatever he wants to .
I love this one .
I played with Tom .
I &apos;m here for you .
Look at what Tom is doing .
This bicycle belongs to my brother .
I &apos;m eating an apple .
She ran outside to see what had happened .
Have you heard this story already ?
They don &apos;t need to do it right away .
Don &apos;t fool yourself . He doesn &apos;t love you .
Did Tom tell you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t come here yet .
I can &apos;t live without her .
Can you see Tom ?
Tom told Mary that Alice wasn &apos;t his girlfriend anymore .
I &apos;m the same height as Tom is .
Tom will be back in an hour .
How about another cup of coffee ?
Tom already knew the answer .
Who has it ?
I hope that Tom can wait for us .
What &apos;s on ?
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I have a little money .
I wonder where he has gone .
I &apos;ve decided not to swim this afternoon .
Where did Tom see you ?
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you .
This is your big chance .
I didn &apos;t know exactly what to say .
Tom was alone in his room .
Look here .
Are you happy here ?
I will never have a son .
&quot; How many girls do you have ? &quot; &quot; I only have one . &quot;
He is a tall boy .
Tom and Mary are often together .
Tell Tom that I need to talk to him .
Tom can do just about anything .
Don &apos;t be late to school again .
It is his decision .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents anymore .
I &apos;m not giving up on Tom .
Do you think that &apos;s wrong ?
My parents are dead .
I thought Tom would like to know .
Today &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday .
Tom is going to be with you .
You can go anywhere you like .
I &apos;ll be going with you .
Tom said he thinks you &apos;re stupid .
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
Tom is the only friend I have here in Boston .
Tom wants to be strong .
We &apos;ve had a lot of rain this month .
Did you study French yesterday ?
That &apos;s what I would &apos;ve done .
You must be crazy .
Only Tom knows .
How many people are there in this office ?
Who &apos;s your uncle ?
I think we have enough money .
I used to be like you .
We lost by a score of three to one .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t very happy here .
If you don &apos;t believe me , go and see for yourself .
Let me help you .
Are we good to go ?
You have no idea what happened , do you ?
I was in Australia for a few weeks .
Tom doesn &apos;t read many books .
Now I get it .
What does your sister do now ?
We &apos;re in Boston .
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
That would appear to be correct .
I want to meet with Tom .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
I already talked to this student .
Tom &apos;ll be ready .
She can play the piano .
Tom doesn &apos;t sleep here .
Let me know if you need my help .
I &apos;ll take that one .
Tom is no longer afraid .
Thank you for coming with me .
It would &apos;ve been better if we hadn &apos;t done that .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go .
Tom wanted to know what had happened .
You look very tired .
I &apos;m the one who &apos;s sick .
You are completely wrong .
What is it ?
How long will it stop there ?
Tom isn &apos;t here , is he ?
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
Tom gave Mary a watch .
Isn &apos;t that what we were supposed to do ?
It was cold in Boston .
I didn &apos;t win .
I don &apos;t understand the question .
He is the father of three children .
You made a good decision .
Mary is a girl .
I remember Tom asking for my help .
That &apos;s where I want to live .
How can I get to the police station ?
Tom pretended that it didn &apos;t matter to him that Mary was going out with John .
You haven &apos;t paid me yet .
I know you can do this .
The bus hasn &apos;t come yet .
That &apos;s our problem .
You &apos;re used to that , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to make it .
That &apos;s the reason he became angry .
She boasts that she can swim well .
He is used to the work .
I asked him to drive me home .
Today , I do not have time for this .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
You don &apos;t need to go .
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
How else can I help you ?
We went to school by bus .
&quot; How many children do you have ? &quot; &quot; I only have one . &quot;
This guitar belongs to Tom .
I gave the boy what little money I had .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house almost every day after school .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak a word of French .
He knows the truth .
Do you live here ?
We &apos;re going to be here all day .
What was I thinking ?
My mother is sick in bed .
I &apos;ll tell you right now that Tom won &apos;t know the answer .
It was nice meeting you here .
You &apos;ve done it !
What do you want me to do with Tom ?
I can &apos;t live without you .
Tom really was my first choice .
I &apos;m a bit nervous right now .
Mary said Tom was in trouble .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
That &apos;s how we did it .
That &apos;s the one we want .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom is literate .
I came back home late .
Tom said he &apos;d help Mary .
When I came home , he was watching TV .
I &apos;ve been busy this week .
My parents don &apos;t understand me .
Tom isn &apos;t very tall .
Tom is still here .
I don &apos;t know how to answer that question .
Everybody &apos;s still there .
They &apos;re all older than you .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
Tom is writing a letter to Mary .
I will never be your friend .
What should I tell the kids now ?
Tom wasn &apos;t done .
Tom said that Mary shouldn &apos;t have walked home alone .
I am proud of my father .
Tom went to the park to meet Mary .
I think I know what &apos;s happening now .
Why aren &apos;t you at school ?
He went to the shop .
She is interested in music .
You like Boston , don &apos;t you ?
From now on , let &apos;s eat lunch in the kitchen .
I have to go to the library with Tom .
I need water .
This isn &apos;t the first time .
Tom hasn &apos;t been sick in a long time .
How hard can this be ?
What is over there ?
Tom &apos;s parents are John and Mary .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
You were busy .
Please don &apos;t tell anybody .
I asked Tom what was wrong .
Tom got nothing .
I &apos;m getting by .
Tom &apos;s mother &apos;s name is Mary .
Why is it here ?
It is better to live rich , than to die rich .
Tom knows her .
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ?
Tom opened the door for Mary .
Tom found a job .
What do I have to lose ?
I wrote Mary a letter .
We &apos;re still very busy .
People are talking .
Where did you stay in Boston ?
That &apos;s not up to you .
My book is on your desk .
I &apos;m here as a friend .
I &apos;m positive Tom can swim .
I don &apos;t want your money .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
I &apos;m sorry . I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
I know why you want it .
Our teacher comes to school by car .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
There &apos;s nothing more to say .
I know what to study .
When did you become friends ?
I want to help .
Tom really doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary where he was .
What &apos;s for supper ?
There are a lot of dogs here , aren &apos;t there ?
You look satisfied .
This one is bigger .
I think that you &apos;re right .
Tom must be over thirty by now .
Tom was right about that .
She took up his offer .
We can meet next week if you want .
Let &apos;s go to a movie .
It &apos;s up to us to do it .
Are you ready to hear the bad news ?
The television doesn &apos;t work .
He died one year ago .
No one knows what &apos;s really going on .
You are not a child anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at work .
What if someone sees us ?
This is hers .
I &apos;m going because I want to .
I asked Tom about his new book .
They need new shoes .
He didn &apos;t get in until 2 o &apos;clock in the morning .
Why does Tom have to go ?
It &apos;s tough to explain .
All &apos;s well that ends well .
Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom .
Can you shed light on this ?
I &apos;m hardly ever home .
She lives with him .
I missed my train .
Tom is going to want to do that .
You should eat more .
I &apos;m leaving now .
Who stole the apple ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
How tall are you ?
I have what you want .
Your French is very good .
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
My brother is out .
Do you want to do this now ?
You have to do it today .
He resembles his grandfather .
I thought Tom could help .
We &apos;re expecting Tom to be here soon .
You should have nothing to do with him .
What did he say ?
I &apos;m happy tonight .
You still have much to learn .
He had already gone .
I &apos;m glad you like my apartment .
Tom asked me a question .
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary &apos;s birthday was .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
Business is slow .
I may not come .
He tries hard .
She is opening the window .
This happened before .
Are you married ?
I really want to know .
If you need my help , please let me know .
Tom is a friend of the family .
I was at school .
Tom slept an hour .
Tom can &apos;t see Mary from where he is .
Shall I drive you home ?
He asked me if I was busy .
I asked Tom what he wanted to do .
That can &apos;t possibly be true .
Tom didn &apos;t seem all that surprised .
Tom won &apos;t be coming to our party .
Tom took off his glasses and put them down on his desk .
This was my plan all along .
Look after yourself .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
We have no idea about his whereabouts .
Can I bring you anything else ?
Tom is well paid for the work he does .
Could you do that ?
The key is on the table .
We gave our word .
I &apos;m here because of you .
You know what Tom &apos;s answer is going to be .
I &apos;m sure Tom &apos;s fine .
I remember having seen her somewhere .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you do that .
How did you make it ?
Who would you like to speak to ?
He asked for money .
Let &apos;s wind up our work .
Tom says that he can &apos;t wait any longer .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
Tom said he didn &apos;t speak French very well .
We want Tom to help Mary .
Is French hard to learn ?
I &apos;m grateful to be alive .
Tom said he was afraid to do that .
We may not be able to afford it .
What was it like living in Australia ?
Why don &apos;t you go there ?
That &apos;s what you always say .
I admit my mistake .
I &apos;m not crazy .
I like to make people happy .
I don &apos;t quite know what to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe I won .
You should work hard .
That would really make me happy .
Tom needs you .
Tom does everything well .
Tom will be so proud .
I don &apos;t like that anymore .
It &apos;s my job to help people like you .
Don &apos;t you want to help ?
You &apos;re so young .
I &apos;m only interested in the truth .
I want to know who did that .
It belongs to me now .
I called Tom the following morning .
Tom got out of the taxi .
I was in prison for three years .
I couldn &apos;t get him to do it .
How exactly can I help you ?
I am accustomed to living alone .
I can do that .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
I don &apos;t remember asking for your opinion .
Tom called Mary a taxi .
This suitcase is too heavy for you .
I still don &apos;t believe it .
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
Tom said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
How long have you been in this town ?
What does he plan to do ?
I &apos;m sorry about that , Tom .
Tom likes to run .
His music is too noisy .
Tell Tom you can &apos;t do that .
Tom could hardly hear what Mary was saying .
I &apos;m not sure why Tom is being blamed for the accident .
I want you to go with me .
I had no other choice .
I &apos;m not coming with you .
I don &apos;t care what the doctor says . I &apos;m going to eat whatever I want .
Tom will be here soon .
Maybe they can be happy .
It &apos;s quite a ways from here .
Tom has to go home .
I &apos;ve just arrived at the station .
All of the students at our school study French .
I called Tom yesterday .
There &apos;s nothing left to drink .
I went to that party .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know each other .
We have to fix this .
Tom went to the beach last week .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
I saw Tom in Boston .
That wasn &apos;t your job .
I always carry a knife .
He arrived as soon as he could .
I don &apos;t care where Tom works .
I bought the book for ten dollars .
I heard Tom is sick .
I won &apos;t say a word .
How is your sister ?
I think Tom used to date Mary .
How big is Tom &apos;s house ?
How many languages do you speak well ?
Tom speaks French as well as I do .
I barely know Tom at all .
They are busy .
He told me about it in private .
I found the picture Tom was looking for .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
You &apos;re not a child anymore .
Why aren &apos;t you at Tom &apos;s ?
That &apos;s right , isn &apos;t it ?
I already knew that .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Have you heard whether Tom got the job ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that Tom had a daughter ?
He was disappointed .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
Tom can swim very fast .
I know how that goes .
Not everyone will love you .
I &apos;m the only one who knows for sure .
You &apos;re going to wait , right ?
I was happy yesterday .
He knows how to make his wife happy .
He is as old as my father .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
This is big .
Today , I am feeling a lot better .
I must have lost it .
Tom spent three years in jail .
These shoes are too expensive .
I &apos;m rather busy .
I took my shirt off .
We &apos;ve got to be careful .
Take the money with you .
It was three years ago .
It may rain tomorrow .
I made this for you .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love it .
Tom left without saying a word .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t like you .
I got here as soon as I could .
I think I &apos;ve heard this song before .
Did they ever find Tom ?
She has a little bread .
He came back two days later .
Tom always does that by himself .
Tom let me win .
Did you do it ?
They &apos;re new .
At five o &apos;clock , there &apos;s always a rush .
I don &apos;t eat any bread .
He made her happy .
It may never happen again .
Tom gave us that .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know .
What are you doing up ?
May I speak to you ?
Tom thinks Mary is rich .
Do you want to get married ?
I wish Tom were more like you .
Why did you call ?
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
I know how difficult this must be for you .
We &apos;re like family .
Are you as tall as me ?
That is not true .
I know the girl playing tennis .
Can we leave now ?
I wish that were true .
Let &apos;s walk on the beach after dinner .
Why are you so busy all the time ?
Don &apos;t you remember who gave you that ?
Tom didn &apos;t want me to stay .
Do you want another one of these ?
I could hardly hear him .
Tom is in the kitchen helping his mother .
Tom drove himself to the hospital .
She had nothing to do with the case .
This is a picture of my car .
I will go if you go .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes it .
Maybe we should wait till everyone gets here before we start .
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend .
I like to do my homework .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
Don &apos;t play here .
Tom got out of bed .
I don &apos;t get what you mean .
Tom &apos;s lucky .
I thought it would be best if you told Tom yourself .
Tom usually eats his lunch alone .
I &apos;m quite sure of it .
He didn &apos;t want to talk about it further .
I &apos;m probably not the only one here who can &apos;t do that .
I know how much you care about Tom .
Did you go directly to your room ?
These aren &apos;t yours , are they ?
Nobody wants to play with Tom .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
I &apos;m going to run .
Who is better at French , Tom or Mary ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is finished .
I &apos;m proud to have him as a friend .
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework ?
I told Tom why I wanted to do that .
Tom made Mary do it .
Come over here .
She doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
I &apos;m hungry . How about you ?
Where do you know him from ?
I come from Japan .
You are important .
I know what they are .
You should meet him .
Where do you think it is ?
He made up his mind .
When do you need it by ?
I &apos;ve already tried doing it that way .
It &apos;s good to have you home .
You should &apos;ve done it .
I really don &apos;t care what Tom thinks .
Tom has to go even if it rains .
It doesn &apos;t surprise me .
What you said surprised me .
We &apos;re taking it seriously .
Your book is upside down .
They love Tom .
How &apos;s Tom going to do it ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
I want to be sure .
Your time is over .
It seems impossible that you &apos;re that old .
Tom believes me .
I am disappointed that my friends are not here .
Are you free this afternoon ?
Is that from a book ?
&quot; What did she say ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t remember . &quot;
Tom bought Mary flowers .
I &apos;m never going to drink again .
How many languages do you speak well ?
Tom died happy .
He &apos;ll be here any moment .
He likes money .
His brother goes to school by bus .
I wish we had done that .
They can &apos;t see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to do .
Tom didn &apos;t change his mind .
I &apos;ll be in my office all afternoon .
Mary plays the piano .
Are you ten years old ?
There are things that women will never understand ...
Are you a good dancer ?
Who was it ?
I &apos;m all alone now .
Tom isn &apos;t able to do it .
I wish we had your problems .
I &apos;m sure Tom can &apos;t swim .
He ran toward me as fast as he could .
We seldom speak French here .
I &apos;ll pay you .
I was born the year the war ended .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
I haven &apos;t even told Tom .
That &apos;s how it should be .
I &apos;m not your daughter .
I want to drink tea .
We &apos;ve all done that .
Tom asked if there was anything he could do .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
It will be finished in a day or two .
I lost everything .
Tom just couldn &apos;t stop .
The box was almost full .
You can &apos;t stop now .
I hope you like what I &apos;ve just given you .
English is not easy for me .
I &apos;m not done .
I won &apos;t do that again .
We &apos;ll come back later .
He knows a lot of people .
It can &apos;t be true .
What &apos;s this got to do with Tom ?
Tom got that from Mary .
Can I count on you to do that ?
What &apos;s it worth to you ?
Tom has a cat , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
That boy is his brother .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
Could you please say that once again in French ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that again .
I &apos;m very proud of Tom .
Why should they stop ?
What did you do last night ?
What can you tell us ?
Did you hear that ?
You should call Tom .
Tom has never been to Boston .
Tom has fallen into the river .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
It &apos;s none of your business .
Is the meeting today or tomorrow ?
Whether or not he will come is doubtful .
You don &apos;t need to explain it to me . I already understand it .
We are who we are .
Do you have a moment ?
Did you buy anything to eat ?
We &apos;re not hungry .
Give me a drink .
I can &apos;t explain it either .
What do you expect me to do ?
I &apos;m eating now .
I came looking for you .
Tom was home all night .
What should I have done in that situation ?
I heard you got married .
Stop reading .
Tom will take the bus .
What does he say in his letter ?
They can &apos;t start without me .
We &apos;re going for a walk in the park .
I &apos;d like you to meet my brother , Tom .
What time do you put your son to bed ?
I can &apos;t just do nothing .
He has already said yes .
I thought you loved me .
We don &apos;t know how or why .
Tom came to school very late today .
That &apos;s up to Tom , not me .
We need to take this very seriously .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
I knew what I was supposed to do .
I &apos;m from the city .
Where did you learn to dance like this ?
Tom put the glass on the table .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone , not even Tom .
Is this your car ?
He &apos;s rich .
I wanted this .
Are you in the library ?
What did you buy for your boyfriend ?
That didn &apos;t really happen .
I &apos;m about to die .
You have to answer this question .
Tom asked me why I couldn &apos;t go .
I &apos;ll fix it up with him .
Did you really talk to Tom ?
All men must die .
Why didn &apos;t you just pay Tom ?
Nothing comes from nothing .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend and Tom doesn &apos;t either .
I have no idea where we are or where we &apos;re going .
I came by car .
Tom was very tired and fell asleep during the meeting .
Yesterday , I didn &apos;t say anything .
We &apos;ve talked about it .
Your son is dating my daughter .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with Tom ?
I went for a walk in the park .
I can &apos;t see anything without my glasses .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to buy what he wanted to buy .
I still don &apos;t like Australia very much .
The meeting &apos;s about to start .
I &apos;ve heard quite a lot about you .
If you want me to help you , all you have to do is ask .
Tom can play the piano much better than me .
I remember your face , but I don &apos;t remember your name .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;m going .
That won &apos;t change .
Take a look , Tom .
Please give me the letter .
He &apos;s doing it right .
Give it to me , please .
Tom and Mary can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
She got through her work before five .
Reading books is important .
We have to make a decision .
What &apos;s eating her ?
You need to tell Tom the truth .
Do you want to see my cat ?
You must stay awake .
Tom says that he &apos;s just eaten .
This is where my father works .
Tom came here .
I don &apos;t know everybody in this school .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
Tom does what he says he &apos;ll do .
That boy looks like Tom .
Do you want to go to Boston with me ?
No one knows how it works .
They &apos;re walking without shoes .
Maybe you should ask around and see what other people think .
Where did you get that ?
Tom comes from a small town .
He knows close to nothing about this issue .
Tom &apos;s going to Boston on Monday .
Have both of you already eaten ?
Tom wants us to think he &apos;s happy .
Tom &apos;s sleeping .
I did my homework yesterday .
Did Tom go ?
I don &apos;t want to go to the hospital .
Why are you acting like you don &apos;t know me ?
Did you come by car ?
Do you wanna talk ?
Tom will be here in a while .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
I wanted to help you .
I don &apos;t study as much as Tom does .
This book is not as easy as that one .
It really doesn &apos;t concern you .
None of your business .
Tom always arrives early .
She mistook my brother for me .
You can &apos;t pretend that this didn &apos;t happen .
Tom is living with his uncle now .
What Tom said is right .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom what his thoughts are .
Tom isn &apos;t asleep .
Tom has known Mary for close to ten years .
That car is hers .
It isn &apos;t over yet .
I &apos;d like to drink a cup of tea .
I got mad .
I &apos;d like to study French .
I wonder where she lives .
Tom and Mary are in trouble .
I didn &apos;t know Mary was Tom &apos;s sister .
They live from hand to mouth .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all speak French .
Tom is in trouble .
I &apos;d just like to know what I did wrong .
I don &apos;t like meat .
That &apos;ll put you in danger .
How often do you go abroad ?
Did Tom do that ?
Tom wishes to become a doctor .
I &apos;m eating .
Tom hardly speaks any French .
I don &apos;t need anybody .
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
I &apos;ve got a book .
You all right ?
Why don &apos;t you help us ?
I don &apos;t care who Tom goes to Boston with .
We &apos;ve got less than three minutes .
I think you like Tom .
I started writing .
That &apos;s a table .
Would you like to go for a swim with me ?
I hope Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
I bought a book yesterday .
I know what you are thinking .
I &apos;ll be back in two hours .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
I &apos;m going to tell Tom the truth .
Let me do something else .
Who did you speak with ?
It &apos;s one o &apos;clock .
I know what I &apos;m doing .
Tom will meet Mary somewhere in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with Mary .
This is all I can do .
Tom has his eyes closed and is pretending to be asleep .
I am not kidding .
No one saw that .
Nobody knows what has become of him .
You don &apos;t have to apologize , Tom .
Do you want me to go without you ?
We should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
I like learning languages .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t coming .
You remind me of your mother .
How did you come to know this ?
Tom needs help .
Tom has never been back to Boston .
We have enough time to catch the train .
Tom currently doesn &apos;t have a job .
Is everything OK with Tom ?
Don &apos;t you remember who gave you that ?
Tom &apos;s mad .
You &apos;re a woman now .
No one came with me .
Tom talked about himself .
So , how long have you known Tom ?
She appeared to have forgotten my name .
You can &apos;t help Tom .
That &apos;s not the problem .
I just need to know what happened .
He met with an accident .
Tom has no idea what to do .
Tom likes you very much .
I don &apos;t know anything about her family .
I &apos;m going to write Tom a note .
Why are we stopping ?
Tom likes you .
I need many books .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
I wanted to help Tom understand what Mary was trying to tell him .
I wanted everyone to get along .
We didn &apos;t do a thing .
There it is .
Tom took his seat .
I can &apos;t imagine what it must &apos;ve been like .
Did you get Tom &apos;s message ?
Tom looked a bit sick .
We want to talk to you about that .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
This camera is small , but very good .
Tom had work to do .
You never say anything .
I know that you &apos;re disappointed .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
I did that all the time in high school .
All you have to do is ask .
He didn &apos;t return until it was already too late .
Tom waited calmly .
This looks great .
I have as many books as he does .
All great men are dead and I am not feeling too well myself .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind doing that for you .
Tom has a little money .
Please remember what I tell you .
You are a woman .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
I knew it .
Tom didn &apos;t write so often .
What &apos;s with you ?
You &apos;re not supposed to do that , you know .
He is something like his father .
It &apos;s gotten better .
He doesn &apos;t speak our language .
I have a lot to do today .
Have you ever heard him sing ?
I want Tom to do that .
What &apos;s that building behind the hospital ?
What are the animals that you can see in this picture ?
Here are their books .
There &apos;s nothing to it .
I would like to meet his father .
Can you meet him ?
How many people are there in this room ?
I was tired today .
Are you happy now , Tom ?
Don &apos;t try this at home .
I don &apos;t care what will become of me .
Are you hungry ?
Tom drove his kids to school .
What did you buy ?
I &apos;d like to read your new book .
I have a brother who lives in Australia .
Why don &apos;t we talk about this now ?
I don &apos;t like to be surprised .
Tom doesn &apos;t tell me anything .
Tom has been in the hospital for three days .
I won &apos;t be coming to school anymore .
I &apos;m sorry I let you down .
I &apos;ll see you in there .
Tom is unwell .
What &apos;ll happen ?
She pretended not to hear me .
You aren &apos;t alone .
Tom called to tell Mary that he &apos;d be late .
I think it &apos;s time for me to say what I really think .
I have no time to go to America .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
I need help .
I don &apos;t want to marry Tom .
I &apos;ve lost .
We know very little about it .
I think you should tell your parents that we &apos;re married .
Today is Sunday .
Tom did a pretty good job .
Tom made himself something to eat .
Nobody came to help me .
Tom never would &apos;ve said that .
We don &apos;t have to go .
Tom often talks to his dog .
I might ask Tom what happened .
Give me my beer .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
This hat doesn &apos;t fit me .
He gave me his phone number .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
Who saw you ?
Tom is standing nearby .
All my friends like Tom .
Tom pretended to be angry .
They &apos;re in the garden .
Tom and Mary are talking to John .
He thinks only about himself .
You must help us .
Did you read the whole book ?
Mary and Alice both used to be Tom &apos;s girlfriends .
The room was full of people .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t from Boston ?
Tom needs your help .
I &apos;ve found the answer .
This room is very cold .
Tom has poor eyesight .
We &apos;re going to try .
This is one of the best places to eat in town .
I went for a walk on the beach .
You can read this book .
Where are you off to ?
Did Tom say yes ?
Tom gave Mary a lift home .
She asked me for help .
I want a piece of cake .
Tom looks old for his age .
Can you stand ?
I &apos;ll assist in any way I can .
They have wine .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary coming ?
Has Tom gone , too ?
That &apos;s altogether wrong .
We love our children .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom ?
I gave her a lift to town .
Tom isn &apos;t watching .
Why does Tom want to stay in Boston ?
He thought I was my brother .
I don &apos;t know what to believe .
Tom asked me if I were hungry .
I admit that he is right .
What do you think of the new teacher ?
That is not your knife .
What did you do yesterday ?
I see you &apos;re doing very well in your business .
You never asked me .
It &apos;s about time .
Tom said he thought it could happen in Boston , too .
Could I talk to you in private ?
Tom said he isn &apos;t going to eat until Mary gets home .
Everyone in her class likes her .
If you want to stay , you may .
I think that Tom should stay .
How long was Tom there ?
I feel my age .
It &apos;s driving me crazy .
Just when I was about to phone her , a letter arrived from her .
We don &apos;t want you with us .
Tom knew Mary was probably not going to be able to do that .
I saw her leaving the room .
Tom decided to stay .
Tom speaks French .
That &apos;s hard to say .
I want to learn a new language .
Are you through with the book ?
The girls won .
Tom plans to go to Boston next week .
It makes sense .
How do you go there ? By car ?
I hate my life .
There is a test tomorrow .
You don &apos;t have to do this for me .
I &apos;ll talk to Tom later about this .
I can &apos;t tell Tom the truth .
Do we have one ?
Is Tom still around ?
She first met him in Boston .
I know where he lives .
Tom is as strong as I am .
She needs you .
The teacher said , &quot; That &apos;s all for today . &quot;
We were surprised how fast the police were there .
I had never done anything like that before .
He was very happy .
It was not until yesterday that I heard about the accident .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
I was on leave .
No one is in the room .
Tom didn &apos;t have the time .
Why don &apos;t you want to tell us the truth ?
She put on a coat .
He died last year .
We &apos;re so busy .
We can &apos;t let Tom out of our sight .
Speaking English is a lot of fun .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it .
Thank you for doing this .
Tom is very kind .
I &apos;ll ask my father for money .
You &apos;re in no danger .
Why didn &apos;t you phone before coming ?
Tom has done his homework .
I have no money to buy the book with .
Tom can swim as fast as you .
Your question is hard to answer .
I &apos;m sure of his success .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for years .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
I have something to ask of you .
It no longer matters .
Don &apos;t put it that way .
What would you have said ?
You &apos;re angry , aren &apos;t you ?
It &apos;d be better if you didn &apos;t come today .
I never go anywhere .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how strong you are .
That TV is too loud .
You never come over anymore .
That &apos;s our fault .
We hardly see you anymore .
They figured it out on their own .
It won &apos;t last long .
We have already finished our dinner .
Tom looked tired .
Tom made fun of Mary .
Tom knows that you know .
They want you dead .
I know this .
Tom has good eyesight .
Tom and I were married in October .
Tom told me it was none of my business .
Where are your clothes ?
Tom got eight hours of uninterrupted sleep .
You are what you eat .
I &apos;ll get a cab .
I still need your help .
I knew you &apos;d go there .
I &apos;m better than Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t mean it .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
How long have you been abroad ?
Let Tom do this .
This won &apos;t be easy .
The problem is that my son doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
I can read your mind .
Promise me you &apos;ll do that .
I &apos;m your age .
We &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
I have another job now .
Tom wasn &apos;t joking .
Tom is skittish .
I shouldn &apos;t have been driving .
I &apos;m happy for you .
She stayed there for a moment .
Tom is there .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
My watch has been stolen .
Tom came to see me .
Learning a language is not easy .
I &apos;ve got a message for you .
He &apos;s a little taller than you are .
I &apos;m not worried about him .
You &apos;re good at this , aren &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t help you with that .
He asked after you .
Tom is a good man .
Tom was quickly recaptured .
She wrote a book about animals .
Is anybody here ?
Do you understand what you have to do ?
We &apos;re at home .
He made us do the work .
Maybe you should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
Tom has been dating Mary for about three years .
He has poor eyesight .
Tom seems to be looking for someone .
I no longer study French .
I don &apos;t want to lose you as a friend .
It &apos;s hot out here .
Tom didn &apos;t call Mary from Boston .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
You can use this car .
It &apos;s not a big deal .
He came here ten minutes ago .
The only person Tom knows here is me .
Tom lives all by himself .
You can have this .
I feel exactly the same way I did three years ago .
We &apos;re going with you .
I &apos;ll get there in an hour .
Your book is on the desk .
Tom could &apos;ve died .
You are not our friend .
Where is there a telephone ?
I &apos;m afraid so .
No one &apos;s watching .
I &apos;m home , Tom .
I bike to work .
Dinner is ready , so we can eat whenever we want .
Tom is back in Australia .
I &apos;ll do that for sure .
Tom comes here almost every day .
He likes music very much .
Tom , Mary and John were all there .
Everyone is tired .
Did you like Boston ?
You can &apos;t do everything .
What was he doing here ?
This is not my day .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
Tom should really do that .
&quot; Where are your books ? &quot; &quot; They are on the desk . &quot;
They don &apos;t like me .
Tom is badly hurt .
I hope that is not the case .
I think Tom knows what to do .
We can &apos;t do this without Tom .
I &apos;m looking forward to this evening .
Tom wants to get married .
I &apos;m going with Tom to Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t want to dance with me .
Tom came just before dinner .
Tom tried to stay awake .
Tom had every right to be angry .
No one asked any questions .
She said that I should quit smoking .
It &apos;ll all be over soon .
There &apos;s no beer here .
She speaks good English .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
I do it because I have to .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know French .
They &apos;re not always there .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary , but he couldn &apos;t find her .
Girls are crazy .
Tom was in the garden .
I hope it rains tomorrow .
I think I &apos;ll be leaving .
I think that Tom should do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this for me .
Maybe I don &apos;t love you .
Does that frighten you ?
Have you tried it yet ?
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help .
I &apos;d rather go for a walk than see the movie .
Who did it ?
Tom walked through the kitchen .
Tom has been lucky .
What do you want me to do with this little girl ?
In a few years , we &apos;ll all be doing that .
The baby is one day old .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
This question is difficult to answer .
You &apos;ll never change .
What have you done ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
Tom is playing outside .
Tom said he thought that I was dead .
Who does Tom do that with ?
Tom lives and works in Boston .
That happened only a few days ago .
We &apos;re going out .
There &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
Release Tom .
We study English at school .
It &apos;s not his idea , it &apos;s mine .
What happened that made you want to stay ?
Tom knows where Mary went .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished his lunch yet .
He looked up the word in the dictionary .
I know that already .
I didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
What they say is true .
It was stupid of me to believe that !
My foot hurts .
I think Tom is alive .
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
Mary bought a present for her friend &apos;s daughter .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a girlfriend .
Tell me the reason why you want to live in the countryside .
Why didn &apos;t you call us ?
Do you know how dangerous that is ?
Has Tom finished already ?
I asked Tom to leave .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
We have only one chance .
Tom wants you to eat .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have married Mary .
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
My uncle lives near the school .
Tom should &apos;ve won .
This book is easy enough for me to read .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
Tom &apos;s doing OK .
I wish I could write as well as Tom .
It &apos;s hard to believe that Tom really did that .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll get it .
Did you understand it ?
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
Why don &apos;t we ask his advice ?
I have to do this before class .
Tom is older than you think .
Tom can fix just about anything .
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
I want to live in Boston .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom still lives here or not .
I was busy the whole day .
I am hungry because I did not eat lunch .
Come on !
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
It is time you went to school .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
People are dying .
Can I go home now ?
Why can &apos;t you come ?
I love to dance .
Can you see anything out there ?
I &apos;m going to go there with Tom .
I tried to tell you .
We still don &apos;t know the truth .
It serves you right .
Tom is my grandfather .
Tom and Mary are still in their offices . Both of them plan to work late today .
My French is still not very good .
I don &apos;t have to study French .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
That &apos;s one way of doing it .
Tom believes whatever I say .
Please don &apos;t ask .
Eat everything .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
Do you want another one of these ?
What &apos;re you good at ?
Is it done ?
She invited him to her party .
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
That &apos;s not going to be easy .
Do you have a family ?
I asked him if I could read his book .
Tom didn &apos;t quite know what Mary meant .
How long will this take ?
Tom wanted to get married to Mary .
Tom kept reading .
Can we please leave now ?
Tom will tell you the truth .
I have plenty of money with me .
Tom asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
When did you start studying French ?
I know that you &apos;re a teacher .
There &apos;s no reason to be afraid .
Are you willing to drive me to the station ?
We &apos;re working .
He spoke too quickly for the students .
Tom must be rich .
Love is in the air .
I want you to do this work .
I want to apologize for last night .
No one has died yet .
Tom asked Mary to buy him something to eat .
I don &apos;t like anything here .
You &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m sure Tom will be here soon .
Are both of you ready to go ?
When did you buy it ?
They &apos;re both expecting babies .
Who are you ?
Why do you want to take a taxi ?
My father bought me the book .
We know why you did it .
All you have to do is ask .
What &apos;s my book doing here ?
My boyfriend thinks I &apos;m crazy .
I wonder why Tom does that .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
I was ready for Tom .
Where did you get that shirt ?
He is about your age .
Didn &apos;t you use to work at a hospital ?
She can sing better than anybody else in her class .
I asked Tom if there was something I could buy for him .
The man sitting next to me spoke to me .
She speaks ten languages .
Nobody knew .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
Seeing that it is raining , you had better stay home .
It was not easy for us to find his house .
Tom says he enjoys speaking French .
Tom is in .
He can &apos;t help you .
She found it difficult to answer the question .
I love Boston .
Why did you pick Tom ?
I &apos;ll be ready in a jiffy .
If only I could drive a car .
I &apos;ll wait for a week .
Come along .
Tom saw Mary .
We &apos;re pretty disappointed .
What I need is a friend .
She &apos;s teaching us French .
Tom is going to make mistakes .
Tom and Mary are both students .
Tom is in his car waiting for Mary .
Tom and Mary know about it .
I &apos;m not doing this for you .
We don &apos;t have it .
She didn &apos;t seem interested .
I &apos;m not very good at this .
Tom definitely wanted to do that .
When is breakfast ?
This is my decision .
No one takes us seriously .
At first , I thought he was your brother .
Tom may leave .
I &apos;d like to be like Tom .
He will never live up to his parent &apos;s expectations .
That &apos;s a hard question to answer .
You must know yourself .
He couldn &apos;t do such a thing .
Cats don &apos;t like dogs .
She kept him waiting for a long time .
I know that much myself .
Why didn &apos;t you get married ?
Tom avoided Mary .
Do you have kids ?
I no longer need it .
Take your coat .
What do you love ? What don &apos;t you love ?
They &apos;ll find me .
He doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
I hit on a good idea .
Tom is handsome .
You can &apos;t learn a language without making mistakes .
Would you like for me to do that for you ?
I &apos;m about to die .
Tom was the last one to get here .
Tom put some flowers on the table .
Let &apos;s hit the town tonight and have some fun .
There &apos;s not much you can do about it .
Tom said he felt disappointed .
Take things as they are .
Tom &apos;s problem is that he lives in his own bubble .
We don &apos;t like the rain .
Tom told Mary that John was outside with Alice .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Why do you want to take a taxi ?
Where do you stay when you &apos;re in Boston ?
My hands are cold .
I took my shoes off .
Are you still up ?
Did you write this book ?
How old is your daughter ?
What are you going to do tonight ?
Let &apos;s buy this one .
I know how difficult it is for you to believe me .
Your answer is wrong .
Tom &apos;s tipsy .
Take what you want .
I didn &apos;t write that .
What else do you have in your pocket ?
They don &apos;t know each other very well .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d like a drink .
It was a mistake on their part .
We may never know what happened to Tom .
Can someone please help me ?
She did pretty well .
I &apos;m not going to live here .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom could speak French .
Are you new here ?
I hope you &apos;re right .
I gave Tom another chance .
I really enjoyed this book .
We don &apos;t know why he had to leave .
That hat becomes you .
She was there all morning .
She has more books .
Tom told me to be kind to others .
This bed is cold .
Tom almost never watches TV .
The crown of this hat is too high .
He went to America last week .
Tom was never really in love with Mary .
Have you read this yet ?
I know where Tom works .
I don &apos;t know how you do that .
How many hours a day do you study French ?
Maybe I should write a letter to Tom .
He &apos;s taller than me .
Is Tom still married to Mary ?
Tom is no longer living in Boston .
What do Tom and Mary do ?
I &apos;m a busy guy .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
He needs you .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re crazy .
Take all the time you need .
I want to win .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want me to do that ?
It is too hot .
He had to work hard day and night .
Don &apos;t you want to go with us ?
You &apos;ll find a job .
Tom is much older than I am .
Tom was willing to try it again .
You need not do it at once .
I assume the two of you know each other .
Tom needed the money .
Tom already knows what Mary has done .
I don &apos;t want to get married , but I want to have kids .
How does this look ?
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
I really thought Tom was happy .
Did you give it to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk right now .
This is sick .
Why is everyone afraid of Tom ?
What else does Tom want ?
Tom said Mary was willing to do that tomorrow .
Tom went to Boston at the end of October .
Why are you so busy today ?
They weren &apos;t invited .
Tom is lying on the floor , dead .
Would you like a glass of water ?
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston .
We &apos;re cooperating .
Would you like to hear me sing ?
When are you coming back home ?
Did you like Boston ?
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time .
Tom is still sleeping .
He is lying on the sofa .
I think Tom is drunk .
What &apos;s going on with kids these days ?
Tom showed me a picture of the food they had eaten .
Tom and I were the only ones who didn &apos;t know how to speak French .
You can &apos;t make everybody happy .
What are you doing this weekend ?
You &apos;re the only one I have .
When I was your age , I was already married .
Why are you so busy today ?
Tom was too angry to speak .
My children rarely go outside .
Let the children play .
I &apos;m not happy with it .
I hope this works .
Tom showed Mary the letter he had just written .
Tom deserves that .
My work is almost finished .
Did you write this book ?
She wouldn &apos;t even speak to him .
What did you have for breakfast ?
He called his mother up from the airport .
I want to talk to you about last night .
This can &apos;t be true .
Are there kids ?
She spends a lot of money on books .
I want you , Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t married anymore .
Tom never talks about his feelings .
Tom is the only person I know besides myself who likes to do that .
My father is busy just now .
Mary is a mother .
Can you play the guitar ?
Tom knows what it is .
Let &apos;s take a train .
He is employed in a bank .
Tom plays the piano better than I do .
Tom and Mary are going to give it a try .
You should call Tom .
She doesn &apos;t like anyone .
It is pretty cold today .
Tom wasn &apos;t alive .
Would you like to sing ?
I sometimes drive too fast .
You have done well .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
I &apos;d like to introduce you to my parents .
I &apos;m doing fine .
Tom lives near here .
I think Tom will win .
Tom isn &apos;t here now .
You should eat something before you go .
Tom left Australia three days ago .
Tom bought a camera for me .
I gave him a call .
I came to give you this .
Tell him where he should go .
What shall we do today ?
How do you like it ?
I bought some bread .
I know I probably won &apos;t win .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t happy .
Their son grew bigger .
She quit the company .
How long will you be staying ?
We love what we do .
How far is it from here ?
That &apos;ll be fun .
I go home early every day .
What Tom really wanted was to be happy .
It should be fun .
Tom is very old .
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
They don &apos;t help .
We went to the park to play .
I want a room for tonight .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
I was at the hospital with Tom when he died .
What are you doing in my office ?
Can I stay a little longer ?
She liked talking about herself .
I love my dog .
I gave him a book .
I wasn &apos;t the only one who was there .
Tom is older than I thought he was .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t go .
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
Let me see .
Tom may do that .
I have to reply to this letter .
Do you want to learn to play guitar ?
This is your book .
Who &apos;s sick ?
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I &apos;m not in the office today .
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me .
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French ?
His father died last year .
What time does the bus leave ?
How far away is your school ?
What is this car doing here ?
They say he &apos;s sick .
Just go back to bed .
You did that in school , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom saw Mary today .
Today I don &apos;t feel like doing anything .
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
Is the bank far from here ?
Is he back already ?
I didn &apos;t hear him coming .
I am taking tomorrow off .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
I think Tom is going to win .
You don &apos;t want Tom to think you &apos;re stupid .
Tom told me he wanted to quit his job .
Is Tom nervous ?
Everybody is different .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
Tom left ten minutes ago .
Why are you out here ?
What I have to tell you is very important .
So where are you guys going ?
If you don &apos;t want to do that , it &apos;s OK .
We &apos;re not dating .
I &apos;m fine .
You know how important this job is to me , don &apos;t you ?
I never hear anything .
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
I don &apos;t recall asking you for help .
I came here to tell you something .
Tom went swimming with his friends .
I don &apos;t believe it at all .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to Tom ?
Listen , I need your help .
I never do that .
Tom asked Mary some questions that she couldn &apos;t answer .
He has not written to them for a long time .
I don &apos;t recall asking for your advice .
I wonder if Tom is illiterate .
You can &apos;t help Tom .
I read a letter .
It was ages ago .
You have to start .
We &apos;ve been here before .
He does nothing but play all day .
I thought Tom had already tried to do that .
You are rich .
You &apos;re the best sister in the whole world .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
The boy pretended he could read , but he was holding the book upside down .
I &apos;d love to see them .
I like that .
Tom left the house .
This is my new car .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
It &apos;s time we went home .
I was told you were reliable .
Tom approves .
I usually agree with her .
Tom wouldn &apos;t listen to my advice .
When does the last train leave ?
You should see a doctor .
I like fish .
I learned a lot from you .
Give this to Tom .
That was somebody else &apos;s idea .
Maybe Tom knows something .
What do you know about Tom &apos;s family ?
If I don &apos;t go , who will ?
I can &apos;t see Tom .
I &apos;ll be back in five minutes .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
You &apos;re a better cook than I am .
They lost again .
Tom isn &apos;t nasty .
Stop pretending you don &apos;t know me .
Tom never reads .
Here is my bicycle .
How old is this TV ?
It &apos;s not there .
I meant to call you .
I talked with her for an hour .
It was his decision .
Tom realized that he might be late .
He has no right to do this .
What do you think I &apos;m doing ?
Open the window , please .
Tom will come at 2 : 30 .
Tom had no water to drink .
Tom hasn &apos;t been home yet .
Do you think I don &apos;t know what you did ?
I knew that would happen .
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
I am six feet tall .
She couldn &apos;t understand what had happened there .
Tom and Mary looked at each other nervously .
Tom won &apos;t go away .
Why did you call ?
Where &apos;s your friend ?
I hope that she &apos;ll get well soon .
I &apos;ve got to go back to Boston tomorrow .
I wish I had a car .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you today .
I am not interested .
You &apos;re not even paying attention .
A promise is a promise .
Your thirty minutes are almost up .
You and Tom are the best friends I &apos;ve ever had .
I &apos;m learning English .
English is studied all over the world .
Where can we meet you ?
This might not be enough .
You don &apos;t stand a chance against him .
That &apos;s enough for today . I &apos;m tired .
Thank you for trying .
I chose not to do that .
Would you like some more tea ?
Tom wants to see Mary .
Tom was one of my first students .
You &apos;ve never been as busy as I am right now .
We need to eat .
She works very hard .
Where did it all start ?
Why are you reading that book ?
I &apos;m going there now .
I don &apos;t need a boyfriend .
I know everything about Tom .
He doesn &apos;t have to know .
Why do you want it ?
Let &apos;s eat lunch outside .
Where is your dog ?
Do you want to become a father ?
Tom died , not Mary .
Is there anything you want to tell us ?
I was really busy .
He likes watching TV .
Why do you think we &apos;re here ?
He seems tired .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
Tom called a taxi for me .
The dictionary is on the desk .
I &apos;m not allowed to tell you .
We have one for you , too .
Would you like to go to a movie ?
I &apos;ve studied French for three years .
I gave up .
You &apos;ve just got to try harder .
Why does this surprise you ?
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom all week .
I went to bed a little earlier than usual .
That &apos;s what women want .
There is only one bus every two hours .
No one believes me .
I &apos;ll write to you or I &apos;ll phone you next week .
I went outside early in the morning .
You &apos;re both insane .
I know that it &apos;s there .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you asked .
Are you sure you can afford this ?
You remind me so much of Tom .
You did really well .
All the students here must study French .
This house has six rooms .
That &apos;s better .
Tom and Mary both want to know what happened .
We were busy .
What is the matter with you ?
Do you want any of these flowers ?
Give me another reason .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary that he was married .
It &apos;s rather cold today .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a boyfriend .
I &apos;m not sure , but I think I hate Tom .
Why am I still here ?
He hit me on the head .
Tom speaks French better than Mary .
What a big dog !
I thought you said Tom would be asleep .
I thought you &apos;d want to see this .
Don &apos;t close your eyes .
She &apos;ll probably come .
I want to study French .
Don &apos;t mock me .
We &apos;ll do that .
They &apos;ll find him .
I &apos;m afraid of my boss .
My whole family &apos;s from Boston .
Let me explain it once more .
He sat looking out of the window .
I &apos;m furious with Tom .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
I thought you &apos;d already talked to Tom .
I bought a book yesterday .
Tell Tom why you didn &apos;t do that .
I put on my glasses .
Look at this one .
They did what had to be done .
Time waits for no one .
There is no future in his job .
Tom saw that Mary was busy .
Everyone does it .
It &apos;s getting late , so we &apos;d better get going .
It is hard for me to believe this .
That &apos;d be fine .
I like the beach .
I &apos;m just not very hungry .
Tom is riding a bicycle .
How &apos;re you doing ?
This bicycle is mine .
Were you expecting something else ?
I sat down next to him .
Tom hasn &apos;t read this book yet .
Tom never did anything for anybody , except for himself .
I told Tom not to worry .
I don &apos;t know Tom , but I know his sister .
There are a few apples on the tree , aren &apos;t there ?
This is where Tom wants to live .
You don &apos;t look well .
It could &apos;ve been better .
Why do you have so many cats ?
Tom and Mary sometimes play tennis together .
I want an apple .
I want to know who did this .
Tell Tom to be careful .
He has this large room to himself .
Tom died there .
Tom helped Mary on the bus , and then got on himself .
He gave them a lift to the town .
That house belongs to him .
Tom deserves that .
I have your dog with me .
I can swim fast .
When was the last time you saw her ?
He can swim .
He doesn &apos;t know any of us .
He knows how to speak to children .
He hasn &apos;t written to them in a long time .
Why were you looking for Tom ?
I want to go to the city .
I haven &apos;t finished reading this book .
What did you say your name was ?
You must go to school .
Are you really going to move to Boston ?
Can I be there when you tell Tom ?
Tom looks tired , doesn &apos;t he ?
Why does Tom not like you ?
Tom is all by himself .
It &apos;s pretty clear you have a problem .
Nobody really believed it .
We know how Tom is .
There &apos;s no need to apologize .
If it rains tomorrow , we &apos;ll not go there .
That job paid well .
Tom ate all the bread .
This bag is mine .
Is there a hospital near here ?
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
I can read your thoughts .
Tom and Mary just got married last year .
You need to stop .
Tom said that he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
I want to be what you want me to be .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
I think it &apos;s too early to tell .
How did Tom get to know Mary ?
She goes to school by bus .
There &apos;s so much left for me to learn .
Tom and Mary looked into each other &apos;s eyes .
I saw Tom dancing with another girl .
Tom was going to do that .
She blamed him for all her problems .
Tom is probably not very hungry right now .
He &apos;s as strong as a horse .
Tom looks like a girl .
His French is improving little by little .
Everybody &apos;s here .
There are people who talk just because they have a mouth .
I &apos;m interested .
I did it .
You shouldn &apos;t try to do everything by yourself .
Tom sat on a nearby bench .
He dressed like a girl .
Why do I have to be here ?
I would like to ask two questions .
We &apos;re short on time .
I opened the window .
Tom stood between John and Mary .
Tom was standing in front of Mary &apos;s house .
I think we should follow Tom .
Tom took a taxi to the hospital .
This looks good .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t take French in high school .
He is far from happy .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
Tom started learning French last year .
Did you read it at all ?
Tom knew there was no point in talking to Mary .
I &apos;m happy about this .
I don &apos;t know what to do either .
Tom has never been married .
I had my money stolen somewhere .
I know what you did in Australia .
I listen to music .
I remember your face , but I don &apos;t remember your name .
What have you done ?
You didn &apos;t hear this from me .
What am I to do ?
Tom spoke slowly .
Tom discouraged me from doing that .
He can &apos;t sing well .
I don &apos;t have much time now .
Tom was the one who wrote this story .
I think you &apos;ll like it .
Both of you ought to do that .
Tom loves reading .
That &apos;s not how it works .
I &apos;ve given you my answer already .
What &apos;s worrying you ?
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
I already told Tom .
I &apos;ve heard that .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
Tom stood in front of Mary .
It has nothing to do with you .
Tom sat between Mary and her husband .
He isn &apos;t like his brother .
Tom wished Mary liked him better .
I came here to make you an offer .
Tom knows nothing .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary .
Tom has big problems .
Could you tell me how to get to your office ?
I ate too much today .
People here love you .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French , and neither do I .
I just want to help .
Who is your friend ?
Your time is running out .
I &apos;m in the hospital .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else we have to do ?
Can you believe that ?
Here &apos;s the one I like .
I have to give it to Tom .
What are you two doing ?
Tom and I got married in Boston three years ago .
We can &apos;t leave Tom .
When do you eat dinner ?
We were at school together .
Why does Tom have to do that ?
Does that frighten you ?
Have you seen my glasses anywhere ?
This book is too difficult to read in a week .
I don &apos;t intend to do what Tom told me to do .
Is Tom finished eating ?
I can &apos;t handle them .
I &apos;m taking the train to Boston .
Do you have some money ?
When did that happen ?
I can tell you where to find Tom .
Tom is willing to try anything .
Do you want to use mine ?
The store &apos;s closed .
I &apos;m not looking forward to seeing Tom .
Tom is home .
I asked Tom to wait for a few more minutes .
Ask Tom if he &apos;ll stay in Australia .
He &apos;s three years older than she is .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody in the house .
I have no idea what Tom will say .
She is about your age .
I do it because I want to .
Give me the book .
When are you going to get married ?
Tom said he wanted to stay at home all day .
Tom and I both want to go to Boston .
We &apos;re not going to wait for Tom .
When will you ever learn ?
Tom was born on a Monday .
Tom has tried to kill himself again .
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
You don &apos;t know anything about me .
Nobody could decide as to what to do .
They started the meeting without me .
I &apos;m headed back into town .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
I do not understand you .
I could &apos;ve done that by myself .
Tom looked up at me .
Why are you still here ?
She needs you .
I must find Tom .
She &apos;s sure to succeed .
Did you do something you shouldn &apos;t have ?
Are you sure everything &apos;s OK ?
You can call me when you want .
Tom can &apos;t imagine living without Mary by his side .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s father .
Tom is seldom ever on time .
I &apos;m not over thirty years old .
It &apos;ll be OK .
I can &apos;t figure out why she didn &apos;t come .
We still have to do that .
It &apos;s up to you to make a choice .
There is still much more to be done .
I &apos;ll sleep on the floor .
It &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
That is not my fault .
He talked to himself .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
Have you ever been there ?
What did you do last Sunday ?
She will come if you ask her .
&quot; Where would you like to work ? &quot; &quot; In Australia . &quot;
Tom bought a car last week .
We can still learn a lot from Tom .
Tom wanted to be there .
I can hardly hear you .
Are you still in love with Tom ?
Children should obey their parents .
His sister is not going to America .
You &apos;ll have a rough time .
Who &apos;s she ?
Tom and I worked together in Boston .
She never stays long .
Running so fast is impossible for me .
I just wanted to see what would happen .
I don &apos;t care for eggs .
I didn &apos;t need to tell him .
I &apos;ve never heard of such a thing .
Tom needs your help to do it .
Tom is not always busy .
The only one here who can do that is Tom .
Is your father a doctor ?
I don &apos;t think they &apos;re married .
What do you expect me to do ?
Come back later .
It &apos;s all right .
I haven &apos;t yet asked Tom for his opinion .
She didn &apos;t say a word to me all night .
My friends went to the movies without me .
Why do you think ?
Tom tries hard .
Is it good ?
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow .
Tom told Mary it wouldn &apos;t be easy .
He can speak not only English but also French .
Did you call anyone else ?
Tom is walking towards Mary .
We &apos;re going to get you home .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be very tired .
We still want to help you .
He will soon become a father .
May I start eating now ?
Tom is doing his homework .
I know how to solve the problem , but I &apos;ve been asked not to tell you .
I &apos;ve learned so much .
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
Just say what you want to say .
What he is saying does not make sense .
The girl who &apos;s playing the piano is my sister .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s doing now .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks to his children .
I &apos;m learning how to drive .
If it rains tomorrow , I won &apos;t go .
Perhaps I can answer that question .
Can you direct me to the train station ?
He is afraid of becoming sick .
We &apos;re moving out of this apartment next month .
I want you to be my friend again .
Tom likes taking walks with Mary .
The party won &apos;t start until Tom gets here .
I was in love with Tom once .
Tom has one brother .
Are you disappointed ?
It could be anyone .
I hope this isn &apos;t true .
We must not be late .
I don &apos;t like this game .
I feel better than ever .
Why did you invite Tom to the party ?
Has Tom ever seen you win ?
Can you imagine that ?
He didn &apos;t stop talking .
You don &apos;t need to go there if you don &apos;t want to .
He was in the hospital for a week .
May I visit your home one of these days ?
Am I supposed to eat this ?
Tom is OK , isn &apos;t he ?
Let &apos;s have a try .
I feel well .
People like to talk to you .
I &apos;m not going to go with you .
It would have been nice if Tom had listened to what I said more carefully .
You &apos;re in no danger .
I want some water .
I did nothing during the holidays .
Why do people say that ?
I thought you weren &apos;t coming .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
The fire is out .
I don &apos;t know what to do about Tom .
This time tomorrow I &apos;ll be studying in the library .
What happened to your car ?
You can visit me tomorrow .
What kind of books do you like ?
He told me that he was hungry .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
Nobody saw me .
Tom isn &apos;t dumb .
It &apos;s your only chance .
What &apos;ll you give Tom ?
How many people are here today ?
I don &apos;t want to be you .
What does Tom expect ?
Let Tom finish .
You may go anywhere you like .
Let &apos;s go to eat together .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Is it OK if I go home now ?
He took a week off .
Do you know that guy &apos;s name ?
I would &apos;ve loved to meet Tom .
I &apos;ll be alone .
It isn &apos;t easy to understand his ideas .
I speak French much better than Tom does .
We came to Boston yesterday .
I was not a good mother .
Tom likes it here .
Why are you doing all this for us ?
Tom told Mary that he had feelings for her .
Tom knows he can always count on Mary .
I don &apos;t want anyone to see me like this .
Is this my life ?
I &apos;ve got some questions for you .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom for advice ?
Do you know what Tom ate for lunch ?
Where were you when Tom needed your help ?
Tom didn &apos;t know a thing about it .
Tom asked me to do that very carefully .
It sounds interesting .
Tom is coming on Monday .
You learn fast .
My cat loves milk .
Tom is riding his bicycle .
She bought that camera while she was in Japan .
Tom accepted Mary &apos;s offer .
Are you saying that you don &apos;t have enough money ?
I will get it for you .
He was not sure what to do .
Leave it there .
That doesn &apos;t belong in here .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t ask .
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for her help .
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d seen John with Alice .
Did you meet him ?
We usually go to the beach in the summer .
This is an apple .
I asked him to be here by six .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t know that .
I &apos;m glad you brought this up .
Tom was so careful .
I &apos;m not always busy .
I have many problems to solve .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
I &apos;ve got to get back to work .
We must help Tom .
I was wondering if you were going to show up today .
How far is it to the station ?
I want to see Tom so bad .
I &apos;m coming right away .
We won .
Did you see it ?
I think that this is important .
I want to do this for Tom .
These are the names .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I thought you said someone was going to meet us .
You should have one of us do it .
Do you want to talk ?
I don &apos;t know if I can come .
He can read well .
I was tired .
We &apos;re safe here .
I need to have a talk with you .
I believed you .
I &apos;ll call you every night .
Tom looks like he &apos;s hot .
No one saw Tom do that .
There &apos;s no one in the house .
You are entirely correct .
The film was a great success .
I &apos;d like not to do it .
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary .
That will be funny .
I like you a lot .
I want one !
You &apos;ve hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom is too young to get married .
I know what Tom is likely to do .
Tom is speaking .
This is my car .
It &apos;s our only chance .
&quot; Where is her book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
I &apos;m busy looking for an apartment .
While in prison , Tom worked in the kitchen .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
I made my decision .
Are you disappointed ?
Do you think Tom will visit us next summer ?
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
I have no idea what to expect .
I don &apos;t really think so .
You look stupid .
What &apos;re you thinking about ?
Do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
Tom slept soundly .
Tom wanted to return to Boston .
I &apos;ve got a question .
He has nothing against it .
Is that your son ?
Why do you want this job ?
That &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
Listen to me , Tom .
I &apos;m feeling sick .
I didn &apos;t go to school .
You must help us .
The bike &apos;s mine .
She is anxious about your health .
Tom thinks his country is the greatest country in the world .
Can you show us the house ?
I have a lot of friends .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I like speaking in French .
This is just too big for one person to carry .
I think I remember you .
I need you to leave now .
I never want to see your face again .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I want to stay .
Is it there ?
I have something to tell you .
You make me happy .
How did you come by that much money ?
I went to the station .
Tom loves playing the piano .
When does Tom get here ?
It looks like snow , doesn &apos;t it ?
What would you have done in my place ?
Is this Tom &apos;s room ?
This is what I need .
That was never my problem .
It &apos;s worth the money .
I know the house where he was born .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like that .
Where have you been all day ?
He got very mad .
I don &apos;t mind standing .
Tom can drive , but he chooses not to .
I &apos;m happy for all of you .
We have to leave in five minutes .
Tom hung out with Mary all day .
It &apos;s ready .
I knew it was Tom .
Tom is tall and strong .
He did not see anyone else at the station .
I didn &apos;t know he was dead .
Is Tom afraid yet ?
I wasn &apos;t at Tom &apos;s party last weekend .
I thought that you had already eaten .
You have to come .
How did you learn that Tom wasn &apos;t living in Boston ?
Tom is unable to do it .
Hey , what &apos;re you doing tomorrow night ?
Mary isn &apos;t just my sister . She &apos;s my best friend , too .
I have something that I want to say to you .
That wouldn &apos;t be too difficult .
I want to visit Boston again .
Won &apos;t you take a chair ?
Let &apos;s go downtown .
I can &apos;t get any work done here with all these children in the room .
He sometimes comes to see me .
Tom knows French .
She went to the hospital yesterday .
A piano is expensive .
It depends on the situation .
Tom loves Mary and she loves him .
If the weather is good , I &apos;ll go .
Tom got married to Mary last month .
The bag is full .
I got here as fast as I could .
She got on her bike and rode away .
Who &apos;s going to pay for all of this ?
Is it a secret ?
Sometimes that happens .
If we &apos;re going to do this , let &apos;s do it right .
You &apos;re with friends .
Why don &apos;t you look for a job ?
Can I do it again ?
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
I shouldn &apos;t have drunk so much beer last night .
They had had that problem before .
You must tell no one .
The doctor pronounced him dead .
You look exactly like Tom .
You had better not read this book .
Tom wanted Mary to go to Boston with him .
We &apos;re going .
What am I doing ?
I have nothing to say to you .
Where do you have to do that ?
Tom knows what you did .
That &apos;s a school .
I speak French as well as she does .
I need your advice .
Tom would leave .
We have plenty of time .
I wanted to go home .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about music .
They are my old friends .
He &apos;s a man now .
I feel like taking a walk .
Tom has left the city .
They may not be home .
Tom really should go to Boston .
He told everyone .
I &apos;m thinking of the plan .
I was a little early .
Put out that fire .
I will read a book .
Tom asked Mary for some money so he could buy something to eat .
Tom has no right to do this .
I &apos;ll do what must be done .
That &apos;s impossible for me .
My friends are very important to me .
You can do whatever you want to .
I sat down again .
French isn &apos;t easy for us .
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
I used to do that every day .
What &apos;re you going to do with Tom ?
How did you do it ?
Tom sat on the bed .
That &apos;s what love is .
One by one , the boys came to see what I was reading .
You &apos;re going to get us all in trouble .
I never said that it wasn &apos;t a good idea .
I know you want to be happy .
You have to let me help you .
Look what I made .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way I speak .
Tom doesn &apos;t talk to me about anything anymore .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
Don &apos;t say that .
They &apos;re bad .
I hope Tom is interested .
Do you want something else ?
I already have a plan .
What &apos;s going on here ?
How do you know there aren &apos;t any ?
It makes me sick .
It &apos;s not the first time .
How do you feel about it ?
This isn &apos;t the first time Tom has been late .
It &apos;s all mine .
Here is a present for your birthday .
Tom doesn &apos;t like those women .
I can &apos;t hear Tom .
There &apos;s nothing to do .
I know what Tom saw .
I didn &apos;t expect you to get here so soon .
The problem is too difficult to solve .
He broke his promise , which was a big mistake .
Is the water cold ?
I don &apos;t know what you want and I don &apos;t care .
The movie was interesting .
He ran as fast as he could .
How stupid he is !
Who do you think will win ?
What do you intend to do with the money ?
I succeeded in getting what I wanted .
It &apos;s not so far .
Tom had nothing to do with this .
Have you had lunch ?
He never stays long .
Why are you busy today ?
Have you ever tried to swim across this river ?
It &apos;s been over a week since I last saw Tom .
I think he &apos;s too young .
I wrote the book .
Everybody loves her .
I understand French a little .
Tom is already there .
Tom looks good , doesn &apos;t he ?
Are you mad ?
Tom is infuriated .
That &apos;s what I want to do .
I will see to it .
I wonder if that &apos;s even possible .
The food is ready .
It was very hard .
Tom knew Mary wasn &apos;t very hungry .
We can &apos;t just act as if nothing has happened .
I lost a lot of money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what that is .
How about going for a walk after lunch ?
Tom is in the garden .
What did Tom say about me ?
I don &apos;t feel safe here .
Tom has been married before .
Do you remember what Tom said ?
I can &apos;t carry this suitcase . It &apos;s too heavy .
Are you absolutely sure ?
Tom would like to know why you did that .
I hope everything &apos;s going well with you .
The test was easy .
I &apos;ll go ask Tom .
Who are you all ?
How often do you go to the beach ?
I &apos;m glad to see you .
Tom has long hair and wears glasses .
You &apos;re good at this .
I just did it .
I must buy one .
Tom thought that was a good idea .
Who &apos;s your girlfriend ?
Tom couldn &apos;t talk .
He &apos;s eating an apple .
I know Tom is still alive .
How is Tom today ?
Did you enjoy the game ?
I &apos;m going to Boston in October .
We want what we want .
What time is it by your watch ?
He plays the piano very well .
Why aren &apos;t you in school ?
I &apos;ll take back everything I said .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything .
You &apos;re very nice .
I &apos;ve been asked to do that again .
Allow me to explain .
Your book is here .
How many times do I have to tell you this ?
Tom is in Australia visiting his parents .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
We don &apos;t study French .
Does Tom know how to do that ?
Tom didn &apos;t want any breakfast .
I &apos;ll go ask Tom .
We were all disappointed by the game .
Are you getting this ?
You &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
Tom is ready .
Tom seemed surprised at the news .
I &apos;m sorry . I really have to go .
You have many books .
I must help her at any cost .
We lost the game .
Not everybody is the same .
It is a matter of life or death .
I &apos;ll drive you somewhere .
This would be a mistake .
I hope he &apos;ll be able to come ! I &apos;d like to see him .
I bought a house .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary wants to go .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d want from you .
Tom and Mary are like that .
Not everyone is like you .
He wants to work in a hospital .
I met Tom today .
The men are coming .
I &apos;m going to swim every day .
I have no time to waste .
Tom has lots of friends .
You can &apos;t really expect to win .
She is not my sister but my mother .
I don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
I want to leave school .
Why do you not like Tom ?
Leave us .
You won &apos;t believe it .
I don &apos;t want to know his name .
I know Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t look rich to me .
What &apos;ll you eat for dinner tonight ?
Tom is coming to my house tonight .
It isn &apos;t difficult to speak French .
I &apos;m injured .
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
Promise me you &apos;ll be careful .
Tom said that he was fine .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m still not talking to you .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t doing very well .
Is now a good time to talk to Tom ?
That &apos;s mine , too .
Do you understand it ?
Life is fun .
I think that it &apos;s too big .
How do they do that ?
Mary can dance well .
It &apos;s not us who did it .
I &apos;m not the one who told Tom .
I consider Tom a friend .
I knew who did it .
That was two years ago .
Tom visited us yesterday .
I like how Tom thinks .
I don &apos;t want to buy anything .
You disappointed me .
If you ever need a job , go see Tom .
He has gone abroad by himself .
If someone &apos;s in trouble , you should help them .
I think we &apos;re too young .
Tom and Mary both study French .
Tom has a thing for you .
I knew you &apos;d want to be told .
Tom did a lot more than that .
I &apos;ve got no idea how it works .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
Are you sure this is what you want ?
Aren &apos;t you late ?
There &apos;s no other way to say this .
She should not have done such a thing .
It &apos;s warm today .
What is it you &apos;re doing ?
I won &apos;t tell anyone if you won &apos;t .
I was just going to say that .
Tom hasn &apos;t done his homework yet .
He wants to go to America .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants to do .
You did what had to be done .
He was born rich .
That &apos;s the way .
I wish I had eaten more .
How did this happen ?
I can &apos;t afford a car .
He is good at singing .
I &apos;m going to stay home today and read a book .
That &apos;s my sister .
Women like to talk .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom dropped Mary off at her friend &apos;s house .
Tom came to Japan from Australia .
Tom returned the keys to Mary .
If I knew that , I &apos;d tell you .
Watch yourself .
Say please .
I think Tom worries too much .
Tom spent three days in jail .
What kind of women do you like ?
I assume you &apos;re getting paid for this .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I wanted to show it to you .
Tom will probably be right .
I forgot to ask him .
We found something .
Tom seemed tired .
May I have a glass of milk , please ?
How was your day ?
I &apos;ll be there Monday .
It &apos;s cold here .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she had to get back to work .
Do you want to learn French ?
I fell .
Why do we have to do it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what Mary has done .
I don &apos;t know about that .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I want to show you something .
I &apos;ll stay at home today .
There &apos;s a new girl in school .
Tom drives .
Don &apos;t look at me .
I usually walk to school .
Tom is certain .
I &apos;m not going to go .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary , but he had no choice .
I &apos;ve said I &apos;m sorry .
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
She doesn &apos;t want him to go to Boston .
A person is worth more than money .
Is that your boyfriend ?
I know how to fix this .
What does that say ?
I was having lunch .
I know you better than your wife does .
He reads a great deal .
Tom says it &apos;s important .
Tom has to help Mary .
How interesting !
I &apos;ve asked Tom not to do that .
This is never going to end .
I should go to bed .
Tom is quite stupid .
How long does Tom have ?
What did they say to you ?
If you won &apos;t tell Tom , I will .
I &apos;ll see to it right away .
It &apos;ll take a long time .
Tom wants to get married again .
I think so , too .
I &apos;d like to see your sister .
Who stopped ?
All you have to do is to wait for her reply .
This is my father .
You mustn &apos;t tell anyone .
Tom may be studying French .
Tom is coming , too .
Tom does that , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
You look nervous .
Did you speak to Tom about this ?
I think you can do better than that .
I will be back in two week &apos;s time .
She started ten minutes ago .
I &apos;m only pulling your leg .
We don &apos;t talk much .
You &apos;re not going to believe this .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to Tom ?
I &apos;ve seen you on TV .
Tom knew he had to help Mary .
I &apos;ll go on my own .
Have you eaten dinner yet ?
I need you .
Have you ever forgotten your phone number ?
Tom is a good cook .
I like to learn ancient languages .
I came looking for you .
Tom is in a meeting right now .
I have a big family .
I cannot help you .
I &apos;m glad to see that you &apos;re happy .
When does the bus leave ?
It &apos;s time for the kids to go to bed .
Tom wants a word with you .
The air felt a little cold .
You may leave your bag here .
Life isn &apos;t easy .
You can &apos;t really understand another person until you walk a mile in their shoes .
Tom has got three of them .
Tom has to look after Mary .
I &apos;ll go by taxi .
They are in the way .
I knew you &apos;d like Tom .
He quickly went out of the room .
I can &apos;t help but think you &apos;re making a mistake .
Let me see what &apos;s in your hand .
Tom seemed stupid .
He &apos;ll be back home soon .
I don &apos;t know that much about you .
Their parents are older than ours .
He looked around , but he saw no one .
I told you Tom would help us out .
Tom now lives with his dad .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Tom will call me .
I was planning to do that , but I never got the chance .
You should have seen it !
Why do you like Tom ?
Tom is done .
Tom only comes here on weekends .
Tom must be tired .
I don &apos;t think this is such a good idea .
What &apos;s your sister &apos;s name ?
You live and learn .
You ought not to say such a thing .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
No one wants to go there .
Let &apos;s leave that matter for later .
I &apos;ll be back later today .
I think he likes me .
Tom actually got Mary to dance with him .
We &apos;ll have to do that , too .
Don &apos;t take me seriously . I &apos;m only joking .
We must find it .
Did you give it to Tom ?
Tom told me that he doesn &apos;t have a problem with that .
Tom has to do it .
Can somebody open the door please ?
We are out of danger .
That made me change my mind .
What time is it by your watch ?
She got no answer from him .
What time will Tom arrive in Boston ?
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
You know his name , don &apos;t you ?
Tom wasn &apos;t helping me .
Tom , I think I &apos;ve fallen in love with you .
I learn French at school .
I came here to do that with Tom .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
You were meant for me .
I bought every book on Japan I could find .
I believe you can help us .
It &apos;s bigger than Tom .
What time will you leave ?
We &apos;ll look after you .
I &apos;m really sorry about that .
Did Tom steal something again ?
I love you more than anyone else .
It &apos;s going to be fine , you know .
Do you want me to go with you ?
I have Tom here with me .
There &apos;s nobody on this ship except us .
You &apos;ve done it again .
Tom and Mary are friends .
Tom asked Mary why she was so mad .
Tom didn &apos;t deserve to die .
Tom will arrive in Boston tomorrow morning .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
No one knows what happened .
Tom came here to see me .
Are we done ?
Do you really want to know what happened ?
Tom helped Mary dismount from her horse .
Where do you think Tom is going to live ?
I have a lot of homework .
Did your uncle let you drive his car ?
Why can &apos;t you come ?
Is Tom outside ?
Tom entered the kitchen .
He never saw his brother again .
He said good night to his parents .
I can &apos;t get this open .
Thanks for believing in me .
Where are we ?
Are you in Boston right now ?
Come home early .
Who will write the report ?
No one understands what &apos;s going on .
Are you certain about this ?
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play outside .
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
He is fond of playing tennis .
The bank doesn &apos;t open for another hour .
Tom has never heard Mary sing .
I can &apos;t let you give me your last ten dollars .
When was it that you first met her ?
Tom wakes up at 8 a.m. every morning .
How did you come by this painting ?
He doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom and Mary were busy .
Could you drive Tom home ?
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Tom chose wisely .
What &apos;s your older sister &apos;s name ?
I &apos;ll never work for you .
Please give me this book .
Come into the room .
Children like playing more than studying .
Tom spends all his time thinking about Mary .
It looks like you need to cook this a bit longer .
I met an old woman .
We play tennis every day .
Tell me the reason you didn &apos;t come yesterday .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s ready .
Please do not try this at home .
Have you tried it yet ?
What goes on in this room ?
It would take a long time to explain it to you .
She &apos;s been in the hospital for a month .
Tom is from another country .
Why are you asking ?
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
I &apos;m not a child .
Tom said that he thought that I was dead .
I can help you if you let me .
Leave it there .
I wasn &apos;t sure what to say .
What &apos;re your plans for the weekend ?
He &apos;s your friend .
Tom said that he would buy it .
Take as much as you want to .
It was cold in Boston .
Try to do better in the future .
It isn &apos;t easy .
Have you met him already ?
That will happen later .
You speak French very well . I wish I could speak it as well as you .
How did you meet your husband ?
Tom has no sense of humor .
Tom must do it now .
Tom lives there .
I love Tom &apos;s car .
Tom gave his cat some milk .
Nobody seems to know where Tom is .
I do hope so .
I have been married for ten years .
The boy was silent .
Tom said Mary may do that .
I &apos;ll always love you , no matter what happens .
Tom had had enough .
I think you &apos;re nice .
I &apos;m rich .
You know French , don &apos;t you ?
I received a letter written in English .
Where did you eat last night ?
They &apos;re special .
Tom knows it .
He had to stay in bed .
I &apos;m seeing you in a new light .
How long have you been here ?
Where does Tom usually eat lunch ?
They already know .
He doesn &apos;t know yet .
Have you called her yet ?
We have fish for dinner today .
Did you hear about Tom ?
I &apos;ll be free all day tomorrow .
I can &apos;t drink any more beer .
Can you swim at all ?
I tried again and again , but I couldn &apos;t succeed .
What &apos;s your son &apos;s name ?
You must help us .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen much of Mary recently .
Come home at six .
Let me see .
Tom very rarely speaks French .
Tom would like to know the reason .
What I &apos;m telling you is true .
He succeeded in swimming across the river .
I &apos;m going , too .
Are you through with the paper ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t see much of each other anymore .
We &apos;ll take it .
Leave us alone .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
I have a lot of money in the bank .
When I was a child , I used to go to the beach every summer .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
I love what I &apos;m doing .
They want to see you .
I wasn &apos;t home .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
I don &apos;t know what more I can say .
I have seen him many times .
He is my father .
I have something to show you .
Tom and Mary have found something .
I &apos;m not Tom . I &apos;m John .
Who &apos;ll start ?
Did you make it ?
You work too much .
It belongs to Tom .
Tom is often late for school .
I can &apos;t sleep .
Tom loves cooking .
What do you want to drink ?
We aren &apos;t alone .
I really couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Who &apos;d buy this ?
Tom wasn &apos;t feeling well .
Where is the boy ?
You &apos;re small .
I was happy to see Tom go .
Let &apos;s go out for a walk .
We &apos;re still working .
All were satisfied .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
He will be back in an hour .
It makes me very happy .
Do you want to go or not ?
Come back tomorrow .
Everyone in my family is happy .
Tom gave me what I needed .
What &apos;re you guys doing later ?
We sometimes make mistakes .
He was reading a newspaper .
He came to Japan when he was 10 years old .
Tom was rich .
I can &apos;t trust what she says .
You don &apos;t think you can win , do you ?
Your dog is very big .
Why don &apos;t we sit down and talk about it ?
Tom was willing to try anything .
You aren &apos;t one of us .
French is difficult .
I thought you were my best friend .
Tom always thinks he &apos;s right .
I plan to never drink again .
The moment he saw me he ran away .
Did they understand ?
You should have one of us do it .
We have come a long way .
Did you ask your mother ?
Tom is able to come to our party tomorrow .
Tom thought Mary wouldn &apos;t likely do that .
You &apos;re going to love this book .
Say it in another way .
Everything is expensive here .
I can &apos;t remember exactly who told me that .
Tom isn &apos;t helpful .
Why does Tom want this ?
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the past three days .
They have lived in this town for ten years .
Tom was wondering if Mary had a boyfriend .
Do you let your children drink coffee ?
I don &apos;t think Tom sees it that way .
I don &apos;t think it matters .
School lets out at half-past three .
It &apos;s really not a good idea .
We require your help .
The light is out .
A beer , please .
I want a good dictionary .
I &apos;ve seen a lot .
Tom can &apos;t sing very well .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed at home .
We can &apos;t wait .
He showed off his new watch .
Tom is quite drunk .
This is not for me .
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom stayed here .
I remember the first time I heard this song .
I &apos;m sorry , my father is out .
I didn &apos;t speak for long .
He saw a lot of animals on the road .
I hope Tom is right .
I can &apos;t go , nor do I want to .
Did you enjoy the film ?
My hearing isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
Tom and Mary both should know better .
Do you take pride in your work ?
When I got out of bed , the sun was already high in the sky .
He was out of town last week .
Tom is going , too .
Tom can do that without my help .
He wrote to his parents .
Tom left early to catch the first train .
That is no business of yours .
There is a library in our city .
He got angry with me .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
Where did you eat ?
Tom and Mary have everything they need .
Tom used to help his father in the store after school .
I don &apos;t know anything about the future .
She doesn &apos;t like going to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I am busy .
I &apos;ll tell Tom right now .
It was night .
Tom had a lot of problems at the school .
These are my friends .
What did you do yesterday evening ?
I &apos;m here .
I saw an airplane .
We &apos;re going to have a baby .
Tom spent all evening on the phone .
Tom was outside .
I don &apos;t want to wait until tomorrow .
Tom immediately began playing again .
You do like us , don &apos;t you ?
Tom needs us .
Tom wasn &apos;t sleepy .
Tom is just trying to scare you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom put his glasses on .
I don &apos;t have an office in this building .
I haven &apos;t spoken French in a long time .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t help you .
What newspaper do you read ?
Your hair is too long .
Tom and I &apos;ll go to Boston .
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
The boy is wearing glasses .
Tom and Mary both want to say something .
Both my parents are at home now .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
What do they do there ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem interested .
Tom knew that Mary was rich .
She &apos;s rather good .
Tom is extra careful .
Tom is doing fine .
I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time .
Wait , why are you here ?
I &apos;ll get home on Monday .
You ought to have seen it .
Is it a boy or a girl ?
Tom will be surprised .
He was sitting in the library when I saw him .
We need to know what &apos;s going on .
I can &apos;t think of a good reason why we should give Tom any money .
How &apos;s Tom today ?
Tom has told me I need to do that .
This rarely happens .
Tom said he knows Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom has money , but I don &apos;t .
Tom said he never wanted to get married .
I have to go ask Tom .
Tom is so stupid .
Are you in love with Tom ?
Let Tom do that .
Can I use your dictionary for a minute ?
I don &apos;t understand it .
He should have done it that way .
You &apos;ve already made your decision , haven &apos;t you ?
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
I don &apos;t think we have enough time .
I can do it by myself .
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young .
There were two cakes .
I didn &apos;t feel like talking to Tom .
Tom seems to know a lot about Australia .
I think Tom may want to do that .
Tom was totally wasted .
I thought as much .
I am really pleased with my new car .
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn &apos;t ready yet .
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Tom called Mary to ask if everything was OK .
I am of the opinion that she is right .
I got back in my car .
Tom loves his job .
Why do you want to learn French ?
The room is quite small .
We need to know whether it &apos;s true or not .
I &apos;m going to give it to Tom .
I was one of the best students in the class .
I haven &apos;t seen her in years .
You may use this car .
My friend was luckier than me .
Who &apos;s staying ?
Let &apos;s live here .
I remember everything .
Do you have it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know any of us .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary drive him home .
I wish I had this problem .
Who did this ?
We must find it .
I will stay home tomorrow .
We know what we &apos;re doing .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do if he were me .
You should &apos;ve stayed in the hospital .
Where will you have lunch today ?
Tom is new .
I know it very well .
That &apos;s very interesting .
Where &apos;s the library ?
He doesn &apos;t live there anymore .
I got one for you , too .
He started to sing .
Tom bought a newspaper .
Tom didn &apos;t know about it .
Tom stood there looking at me .
Is it always cold like this ?
Who did it ?
I don &apos;t know why I just did that .
I &apos;ve never done it this way before .
Why does Tom do that ?
Tom stopped dancing .
I want to hear the truth .
Try harder .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about it .
Who &apos;s standing ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has a girlfriend .
You &apos;re welcome .
It isn &apos;t that simple .
She speaks fairly quickly .
Who stood ?
What makes you happy makes me happy .
I &apos;ll need your help .
Tom and Mary are still just kids .
I &apos;m glad to see you .
I want to talk to you about something else .
Please don &apos;t get up .
I remember seeing you last year .
What happened to Tom ?
You need to start meeting women .
I &apos;m going with Tom .
I think Tom wants me to do that .
I &apos;ll never leave you alone again .
I didn &apos;t buy anything .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
Tom &apos;s right .
I watch television .
I don &apos;t want to see you here again .
Tom and I gave Mary that .
How did this all start ?
Tom and I became very good friends .
Is anybody home ?
Tom had the whole house to himself .
How long has it been since you &apos;ve been to Australia ?
How far did Tom go ?
We saw this coming .
It won &apos;t take very long .
We &apos;re not lost .
This is going very well .
Tom isn &apos;t my boss anymore .
The baby was sleeping all day long .
I don &apos;t want any more coffee .
Tom might talk .
I know that voice .
I didn &apos;t give Tom any choice .
There &apos;s a table .
May I go with Tom ?
We need help .
You &apos;re dangerous .
Tom is standing next to Mary .
Can you even speak French ?
I know I have a lot to learn .
That &apos;s all they had .
What people say is not always true .
Is that a cat ?
&quot; Tom &apos;s death was an accident . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
Tom is three years older than his wife .
You are in my way .
Let me know if you need my help .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to hurt Mary .
I &apos;m with Tom .
I think I might be able to speak French better than Tom .
I &apos;ll see Tom .
We can &apos;t go back to Boston .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
I believe you can help us .
In any case , we &apos;ll go .
Tom was always available when you needed him .
Can I speak in English ?
I don &apos;t understand your question .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
I know exactly where you are .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to stay .
We &apos;re working on that .
I see how dangerous it is .
Where &apos;s my breakfast ?
The weather stayed bad .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come see me .
Nobody taught me .
This is very simple .
We &apos;ve been asked to not do this anymore .
Where did you hear that ?
What time do you finish school ?
Tom gets mad very easily .
They weren &apos;t there .
I can &apos;t explain it .
Nobody came to my rescue .
Tom is too young to know the truth .
I thought I heard something outside .
There was food enough for us all .
That didn &apos;t help very much .
I can &apos;t go to school today . I &apos;m sick .
You should stay at home today .
You can go if you want to .
We are not expecting any help from you .
The dog is sleeping in the car .
Tom must be sick .
Tom couldn &apos;t have helped Mary .
I am ready .
Tom got into the car .
No one has ever said such things to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
They &apos;re no good .
You said it yourself .
This is too expensive !
I thought you , of all people , would understand .
Tom isn &apos;t waiting anymore .
This is a very new book .
Where do you think Tom is ?
He was very busy all day .
We &apos;ve been looking for you .
Tom was my daughter &apos;s best friend .
Tom started working for Mary last year .
Tom usually keeps his promises .
What do I need to do now ?
Why would someone do that ?
Tom is really busy .
What do you want to learn ?
Is Tom here , too ?
I heard that Tom has left his wife .
That &apos;s a book .
Tom has nothing .
I seldom speak French anymore .
He isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I never imagined I &apos;d be working for you .
Tom said very little .
Tom had other things he wanted to do .
He was hurt in the accident .
That &apos;s a picture of Tom and his cat .
I want to eat .
Maybe I just need some time alone .
Please give me a glass of milk .
Why do you have to be like that ?
I bought her a clock .
My mom worries all the time .
She is not a good person .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Don &apos;t you know that ?
I can &apos;t see without my glasses .
I am listening to a song .
That is no business of yours .
Don &apos;t be so sure .
That won &apos;t work !
I think I made a mistake .
These are ours .
Tom came on Monday .
I think you worry too much .
That is too expensive .
I can &apos;t explain it either .
Why are you doing this here ?
You must be tired .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s different from other people .
I can &apos;t do anything about it now .
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
Tom must &apos;ve won .
Where did you learn this ?
That could happen to anyone .
I can &apos;t see you .
There &apos;s nothing anyone can do to change it .
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
That &apos;s right .
Do you know what I mean ?
I don &apos;t like to be alone .
I helped my mother in the kitchen .
You should tell your mother as soon as possible .
I paid for it already .
Tom and Mary are in Tom &apos;s car .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
They aren &apos;t there .
You are only young once .
Tom looked happy .
I know where she is .
I do not want any milk at all .
What kind of music do you want us to play ?
I &apos;m seeing Tom again on Monday .
I telephoned her at once .
There isn &apos;t any milk in the glass .
Tom had a hard time finding work .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like dancing .
There &apos;s something wrong .
The man had something under his coat .
I already know who you are .
Tom is sick in bed .
How far do we have to go ?
No one says that .
Are you dead ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason not to like Tom .
I want to die .
I &apos;m happy for Tom .
Tom wants to get married , but not to Mary .
What do we do about Tom ?
Wait five minutes , please .
She got him to do anything she wanted him to do .
Tom won &apos;t get back home today .
Tom asked Mary for directions .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
That &apos;s a question no one knows the answer to .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
What &apos;s this dog &apos;s name ?
When did you go to bed last night ?
The boy came back .
I &apos;m up .
After dinner , I did my homework .
I &apos;ll see you very soon .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come see me .
Thanks for bringing Tom home .
Tom does that .
I just have a few questions for you .
All you have to do is ask .
Tom doesn &apos;t have tea .
She doesn &apos;t listen to him .
I know what I like .
He gave me this book .
Tom is happy .
Do you want to go again ?
You &apos;re always busy .
I like it this way .
Did Tom eat ?
Tom blames you for the death of his wife .
There has to be another way to do this .
You should have asked her for help .
Tom walked off .
I hope everything &apos;s going well with you .
There wasn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Why are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I can &apos;t believe it !
I guess it &apos;s time to leave .
We &apos;re paying .
I &apos;ve got to see you .
I wish to go abroad .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
What have you been doing all this time !
Tom seemed better .
This is my city now .
Tom , may I speak to you outside ?
Tom thinks about Mary all the time .
Do you know what I want ?
Why did you go there ?
We &apos;re back from Australia .
How much money do you have with you ?
I &apos;ll tell you the truth now .
Tom is driving .
It &apos;s a TV .
The game drew a good crowd .
Don &apos;t keep company with him .
Tom and Mary are practically married .
Do you mind their coming too ?
Tom could hardly believe him .
That &apos;s not for you .
I want to eat something that I can only eat here .
We must go to school .
I want to leave early today .
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
I &apos;m mad at you .
Tom wanted to marry Mary .
Do you want wine ?
It looks like you &apos;re thinking about something else .
I didn &apos;t think this was your seat .
She &apos;s a woman now .
I don &apos;t have a lot of work , but it &apos;s enough to keep me in the office this week .
How am I going to do that ?
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
I think Tom wants to see you .
Tom started doing that a few weeks ago .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
I &apos;ll do it if they pay me .
I didn &apos;t give Tom choice .
Everyone has been there .
You &apos;re young .
What really happened ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is dead or alive .
Tom takes a bus to work .
She was very proud of her father .
It isn &apos;t my fault that it happened .
This is my other sister .
Tom will always love you .
I forgot that Tom spoke French .
Tom doesn &apos;t do much .
You need it .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
Would you like some more tea ?
We had a little water .
How &apos;d you get here ?
We know what you &apos;re doing .
Can you stay for a few days ?
We &apos;re out of coffee .
Has he arrived yet ?
They should know it .
This is life !
I need coffee .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
What did you do exactly ?
I have to help my mother .
We pay Tom well .
We have three children .
What am I supposed to say ?
They don &apos;t understand me when I speak French .
The door will not open .
Tom is fun .
Take care !
What have you done with the watch I bought for you ?
I like this job .
We don &apos;t know what Tom took .
I didn &apos;t know you were rich .
This is difficult .
It &apos;s good to be home .
I &apos;ll take those .
The police found Tom &apos;s bicycle .
I took a cab to the station .
This is the one I &apos;ll use .
How serious are you ?
I want to sing a song .
Tom and I &apos;ve gotten back together .
She is talking .
Your idea is not entirely crazy .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s only chance .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s office ?
That isn &apos;t to my liking .
Your French is improving .
I know what they are thinking .
He tried speaking French to us .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
Do you have any idea who that was ?
We don &apos;t want that .
You &apos;re busy all the time .
I haven &apos;t bought a new coat in five years .
You should find somebody else to help you .
It &apos;s too quiet .
What &apos;s this computer doing here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses .
What more do you need ?
He loves you as much as I do .
What &apos;s Tom still doing here ?
She says that she likes flowers .
Tom is not far off the mark .
I remember having seen her somewhere .
If it rains tomorrow , she will not come here .
I don &apos;t want to be seen with him .
Has Tom arrived yet ?
You surprised everybody .
This is just too much .
Could you make time for me ?
Has Tom arrived ?
I thought you wouldn &apos;t tell her that we hadn &apos;t done our homework .
Let &apos;s wind up our work .
You said that last time .
I &apos;m used to this kind of work .
I love my mother .
Where did you first meet ?
I think that &apos;s impossible in Tom &apos;s case .
I still want to talk to you .
Tom and Mary are in the kitchen .
I think Tom and Mary don &apos;t know each other .
I want a new dress .
This is the first time I &apos;ve been here .
The language spoken in Australia is English .
I like you just the way you are .
Everybody was looking for Tom .
She went with him to the movies .
Does that frighten you ?
I &apos;ll drive myself .
We don &apos;t like Tom .
I know Tom would love to see you .
Tom ought to stop doing that .
You may still do it if you want to .
Tom is better than I am .
I lost the watch .
Tom looks happy .
I am studying English now .
Tom was gone for three days .
I have a little money now .
Today I turn four years old .
I should &apos;ve stayed home .
Why do you always do that to me ?
Tom seemed to be very happy here .
We were expecting a lot of snow .
I can &apos;t explain it now .
How did you get this idea ?
Why don &apos;t you come along with us to the party ?
I can &apos;t let you do that .
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
That &apos;s not my car .
Tom , what are you doing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I know .
They say that he will never return .
Tom has a picture of his children on his desk .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
Why didn &apos;t you just say that to Tom ?
Tom probably won .
He told me not to swim there .
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died .
What did Tom just tell you ?
We really need a man like you here .
Tom has never been in trouble in his life .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have enough money to buy that .
What we had to do was really quite simple .
Do you want to go someplace else ?
Is that Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom came here from Boston .
Tom will be free tomorrow .
Tom sees things .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to do that for you ?
How was school today ?
Everybody made fun of me .
I thought you might like one of these .
Tom likes Mary and Mary likes Tom .
He went to sleep at six o &apos;clock and he is still sleeping .
I still can &apos;t believe you and Tom got married .
Father was crazy about the game .
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
Did Tom say why ?
Do you want to help me ?
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
I was the only woman .
I don &apos;t want it .
How big is this park ?
The baby is called Tom .
I &apos;m learning how to drive .
Do you think it &apos;d be fun to do that ?
Count me in .
I wonder how long it &apos;s going to take .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
You must always do what is right .
The dog looks sick .
She helped the old man across the street .
You don &apos;t have to apologize .
Didn &apos;t you hear her speaking French ?
We have work to do .
I told Tom what Mary told me .
I &apos;m nothing like you .
It looks good .
Please introduce me to your new friends .
What &apos;s that building ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
Tom just never should &apos;ve done that .
It &apos;s not as cold today as it was yesterday .
I guess we could try doing that .
He knows no English .
Tom was the last person I expected to meet in Boston .
Is it there ?
Tom can play the guitar .
What you did made Tom happy .
Tom was pretty much drunk .
Why are we stopping here ?
We must start immediately .
Can you please give me something to do ?
I &apos;m going to go sit in my car .
Do you know who he is ?
Tom and Mary were often seen together .
I &apos;m going to see Tom today .
I &apos;ll give you my car .
Now pay attention .
You look good without your glasses .
Tom got home .
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
I didn &apos;t want to talk to the police .
That book is a new book .
Where do you live ?
I want to hear you say it .
How long does it take from here to your house on foot ?
You should be able to walk in a few days .
How is your family doing ?
Are you alive ?
I thought Tom was at school .
Give me three weeks .
You &apos;re very busy .
Tom met Mary .
What &apos;re you thinking ?
I &apos;ll do it again .
Mary has her problems .
I thought that he knew everything about Japan .
You stole my idea .
He was a tall man .
I &apos;m getting nervous .
We need to know what happened .
I don &apos;t know that .
Let Tom stay .
Tom did it .
I hope no one saw you .
Does that answer satisfy you ?
The only time Tom seems to be happy is when he &apos;s with Mary .
I thought you &apos;d never call .
I &apos;ve done that once already .
Stop being so nice .
You don &apos;t need to worry about such a thing .
They &apos;re in danger .
What is your name ?
I believe that everything will be okay .
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
We are glad to help you .
This town is quite different from what it was ten years ago .
Tom wrote the letter himself .
Tom asked Mary how much money she had .
You read too much .
You &apos;re my boss .
Tom will come with me .
Why don &apos;t you come with us ?
Do you want me to tell you what Tom did ?
If you can , come with us .
Tom got here thirty minutes early .
I &apos;m not sure when he &apos;ll come .
Tom doesn &apos;t pay attention in school .
I still have so much to do .
I &apos;ll give you a piece of advice .
What &apos;ll we tell the others ?
You don &apos;t have to be here .
Why do you have only two cars ?
Tom first met Mary in Boston .
What do you learn English for ?
I know her by name , but not by sight .
I &apos;m very scared .
I &apos;ve met you before .
It was simple .
Do you want me to ask Tom to do that for you ?
It &apos;s too hot .
I have to finish my homework before dinner .
Tom was looking at you .
Tom is here for you .
He &apos;ll become a father soon .
I know how it is .
I can read your thoughts .
He admitted that it was true .
I don &apos;t know how I did this .
They &apos;ll come to us .
Did you get their letter ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know I exist .
I want that report on my desk in one hour .
Tom got in his car and drove off .
It &apos;s too small .
I know where you can find Tom .
This book is too difficult for me .
Can you put the children to bed ?
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
Tom isn &apos;t here .
Which newspaper do you read ?
You &apos;ll be here with me .
She married him for his money .
He doesn &apos;t know French at all .
Go ask your father .
It &apos;s no use worrying about it .
Would you care to try ?
I should &apos;ve listened to my father .
I see .
You need not go there .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll win .
It is time for her to go home .
May I speak to you in private ?
We &apos;ll help you out .
We &apos;re not alone .
We couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
She dressed like a boy .
I just want to sleep for a few hours .
She just left .
Tom didn &apos;t tell everyone .
Tom &apos;s advice was very helpful .
Tom arrived yesterday .
I want to know why you &apos;re here .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
I have work for Tom .
He will wait .
I don &apos;t do that as often as Tom does .
Let me do it .
I &apos;ll see you there .
You &apos;d better do as the doctor advised you .
Tom teaches me French .
May I ask you some more questions ?
The water was too hot yesterday .
What do you plan on doing tonight ?
Tom came from a family who didn &apos;t talk about their feelings .
How cold is it ?
We did all we could do .
She &apos;s as busy as Tom .
Is there anything that I can do to help you ?
The problem is in that it &apos;s too expensive .
This is too much for me .
Why is Tom so scared ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to anybody .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what to say .
Has she ever fallen in love ?
I bought this book as a gift for Tom .
Go to the park .
I &apos;m not really sure why .
Please give me a cup of tea .
Tom said he isn &apos;t going to Mary &apos;s party .
When was the last time you missed the train ?
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
I &apos;ll look it up .
He suggested I go with him to the party .
I don &apos;t remember where I bought it .
I have nothing to say to Tom .
When do you need it ?
A baby boy was born to them .
We met last night .
We just got here yesterday .
Tom isn &apos;t studying French now .
Tom can sleep in my room .
That &apos;s me .
We bought this in Australia .
You &apos;ve won !
Tom arrived early .
You may go .
Pay close attention to what I tell you .
Tom pretended that he knew nothing about it .
Give Tom whatever it is he wants .
Tom didn &apos;t tell you about what happened to Mary , did he ?
We don &apos;t want this one .
My garden is small .
Tom &apos;s shoes are too big for him .
We don &apos;t want Tom to do that anymore .
Can I use this dictionary ?
I think about that from time to time .
Do you have any more questions ?
I &apos;m not interested in your opinion .
My sister saw it with her own eyes .
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
Both her parents are dead .
Tom is roughly the same age as I am .
That &apos;s not a cat . It &apos;s a dog .
Where did you get your camera repaired ?
She committed suicide yesterday .
Tom left the room without saying a word .
He hardly ever works .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he wants .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
He is at home today .
The automobile stopped .
If you don &apos;t believe me , ask Tom .
I &apos;m ready now .
We are going to leave tomorrow .
They blame Tom for everything .
My watch is accurate .
She won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
She was on her way to school .
My son is taller than I am .
Tom is still in Boston .
I was planning on telling you today .
Is someone there ?
He came by bus .
Let Tom drive .
You did all you could .
Who is this boy ?
I bought a dictionary .
Tom has gone home early .
There was nothing you could do about that .
Has anyone ever told you they loved you ?
I can &apos;t let Tom go alone .
You are not going to make it in time for school .
I &apos;m holding a book .
It &apos;s not very good .
I &apos;ll make you breakfast .
It &apos;s not about the money , is it ?
Tom has to go to work .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to move to Boston .
I &apos;m not here for you .
I &apos;m very happy .
This is a very good question .
I &apos;m happy , too .
Tom told Mary about his plan .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
He has hardly any money , but he gets by .
We don &apos;t do that .
Let Tom sing .
I no longer love him .
It &apos;s no secret .
You don &apos;t need to come into the office tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know his name .
Tom did it for his family .
You must get ready quickly .
I spent the whole day playing with my kids .
What are you doing here , Tom ?
This student &apos;s books are new .
I don &apos;t think anyone was here yesterday .
What kind of person is she ?
Tom has no choice .
That won &apos;t work .
Tom is seldom late .
The man asked me for some money .
We could both go .
I think you &apos;re the one who needs help .
Why were you in Boston last week ?
She said she was happy .
He didn &apos;t do any work .
Everybody loves my cat .
He could not speak French well .
What did Tom get ?
She gave me some good advice .
Let &apos;s have lunch .
Where were you three years ago ?
Go to Tom &apos;s house .
Tell Tom when you &apos;ll be back .
I can understand Tom .
I could have been killed .
I met Tom .
You &apos;re tired , aren &apos;t you ? Why don &apos;t you get to bed ?
Each student has his own desk .
Did you talk to Tom ?
You &apos;re not dead .
She has already left the office .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I &apos;m not scared at all .
I think I &apos;ve done well .
We shouldn &apos;t have let Tom go .
Tom speaks French better than I do .
Tom and Mary are doing OK .
Are you going to sing here ?
I &apos;m very busy .
She &apos;s eating an apple .
How about tonight ?
This is food .
Tom can dance well .
How long do I have to wait for the next bus ?
I never see you without thinking of my mother .
How do we get back home from here ?
I &apos;m not sure I can swim that far .
Tom is happy , isn &apos;t he ?
I found the book interesting .
You are everything to me .
I &apos;m already at work .
You missed a lot .
What is all this ?
Why are you avoiding me ?
Is that all you want ?
Tom wants to learn how to play the guitar .
Tom isn &apos;t just my boss . He &apos;s my friend , too .
That wasn &apos;t a very nice thing to do .
Are you as tired as I am ?
Who gave you this ?
Set Tom free .
You &apos;re not dead .
I &apos;m talking about my friend .
I &apos;m certain Tom will want to speak with you .
I saw a lot of things that day .
Did you hear what I said ?
Is there anything you want to say , Tom ?
A good idea occurred to him .
I hope you like what I &apos;ve just given you .
Tom saw us .
Watch this .
Do you want the job ?
That man was born lucky .
I hardly see you anymore .
I heard you talking to Tom .
You &apos;re going to love this .
I think you can handle it .
Have you seen that movie ?
That &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom always leaves for school too late .
He is likely to win this game .
I &apos;m by no means angry with you .
Are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
Did Tom call you last night ?
How do you take your coffee ?
He asked after you .
Tom lives alone in a large house .
Did you speak to Tom yesterday ?
It &apos;s pretty cold .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
I wonder what Tom is reading .
I don &apos;t like her hat .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
They &apos;re playing together .
Tom left right away .
This is Tom &apos;s dog .
May I ask you a question ?
Tom must have seen something .
Her story can &apos;t be true .
Since I didn &apos;t know what to do , I asked him for advice .
Don &apos;t let him listen to this music .
Are you in ?
What can I do for you ?
It has to be there .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember anything .
I was trying to talk to you .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s taking Tom so long .
Tom never saw her again .
Tom wants to buy Mary a present .
I can win .
I &apos;ll meet you back on the ship .
That man ate bread .
I have to study .
Tom asked for my help .
I don &apos;t feel like studying at all tonight .
I don &apos;t really want to be all by myself .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
I bought this book yesterday .
You &apos;re not here .
When the wine ran out , everybody went home .
What is this ?
Tom looked like a doctor .
That &apos;s too expensive .
I don &apos;t want to play tennis this afternoon .
Tom &apos;s older .
I need money .
I &apos;ll wait until four o &apos;clock .
I was very disappointed when I heard the news .
You &apos;re beginning to worry me .
This camera is Tom &apos;s .
The train doesn &apos;t stop at that station .
Tom says he &apos;ll come .
You &apos;re worrying too much .
I can &apos;t help myself .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What you do is up to you .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom plans to buy a new bicycle .
You may come if you like .
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
I wasn &apos;t scared at all .
Tom &apos;ll be here soon .
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all enjoy dancing .
Do you want to go with us ?
I need to help Tom .
She &apos;s older than him .
If it rains tomorrow , they will not go .
We still need more time .
Do you know how the accident happened ?
Have you found something ?
Tom was stupid enough to believe what Mary said .
It &apos;s still new to me .
I think we have to be very careful .
I eat fish every week .
Tom speaks French better than any of the other students in his class .
Everyone is doing it .
Can I take your word for it ?
We stole it .
I asked why .
You can expect me tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t go home last night .
I want to believe you .
I &apos;ll be coming back tonight .
I heard you singing .
I &apos;m closing the door .
We would like to buy a sofa .
Are you students ?
I can &apos;t tell you any more than that .
I didn &apos;t ask Tom to wait for me .
I was late to school .
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to ?
Tom arrived ten minutes ago , but I haven &apos;t yet seen him .
Are you free ?
I &apos;m going to explain it to Tom .
Tom should have left earlier .
Thanks for the offer .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
I have a bicycle .
Tom says he won &apos;t come .
I &apos;m glad you were right .
I have to see you .
I never thought that they would like their teacher so much .
You are too late .
Are you happy ?
Did you speak to Tom ?
Please let me know .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been there .
My train leaves at six o &apos;clock and arrives there at ten o &apos;clock .
Many people came to the meeting yesterday .
What kind of food do you usually eat ?
Are you new , too ?
This was your idea .
Tom has a lot of money , but he has no friends .
You &apos;re interesting .
I think about him often .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston , too ?
You can use a dictionary for this exam .
Tom is out here .
We don &apos;t want you to do that .
There is no time to lose .
Are you still together ?
Are you married ?
I &apos;m listening to music .
That &apos;s what I expected of my daughter .
Tom thinks he knows what Mary is doing .
Are these yours ?
I don &apos;t know why people do that .
That &apos;s never happened to us before .
Tom is never coming back .
You can make your own .
The television isn &apos;t working .
Tom thinks Mary is interested in John .
Maybe they should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
She &apos;s sure to succeed .
I don &apos;t need to do that if I don &apos;t want to .
Tom looks rich .
He ran away as soon as he saw me .
Tom was surprised by how well Mary spoke French .
There are some things that I don &apos;t understand .
Who &apos;s coming with me ?
Are you sure you want to do this by yourself ?
Leave the book where it is .
You may take my word for it .
Tom wants to know your name .
I often make mistakes when speaking in French .
Tom need not have worried .
Tom has no idea when Mary will arrive .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
It cannot be true .
I have another good idea .
I wonder why this is happening .
He is very sick .
We &apos;d like to have a word with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember where he put his keys .
I &apos;m looking forward to the party .
What do you do here ?
If it were not for your help , I could not succeed .
It &apos;s been seven years since we got married .
I &apos;ll show you how to do it .
Tom was trying to be funny .
If I don &apos;t do it now , I never will .
I don &apos;t speak your language .
It looks like an apple .
I don &apos;t eat as much meat as I used to .
When do we go ?
Do you have a book ?
I really need it .
I could give it a try .
You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
Who told Tom ?
Is she your sister ?
Are you still there ?
Tom is taking a day off today .
I have no time to help you with the work .
My dog didn &apos;t do that .
Is it that hard ?
I knew there was nothing you could do about it .
Tom won &apos;t sing .
How could Tom know ?
Tom got very hot .
Tom never was very interested .
The boy has a watch in his hand .
Don &apos;t be so sure .
Aren &apos;t you cold ?
Tom knew this .
Tom might know why Mary has to do that .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me anything about you .
I already speak French .
We need to go .
Tom still lives with his parents .
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
What are you guys planning ?
When did you get home ?
He still lives with his parents .
I can do it myself .
Perhaps you should stop .
Tom is still in Australia .
I wish you had told me that .
If Tom didn &apos;t kill himself , someone else did .
Something needs to be done .
He gave it to me .
How &apos;s it coming ?
What will your husband think ?
Tom had no money to pay for a cab .
It may well be true .
Tom can help you .
This desk takes up too much room .
Where are the other guys ?
No one said anything to me .
You can &apos;t leave yet , Tom .
I found it there .
I didn &apos;t understand what Tom said in French .
How bad was Tom hurt ?
Would you please stop singing ?
Can you speak French ?
I gave him the book .
Can I really have it at this price ?
Do you like eating fish ?
We &apos;ll show Tom .
Tom was born there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long he &apos;ll have to wait for Mary .
He has more books than he can read .
I &apos;ll ask Tom .
I had fun .
What &apos;s under your bed ?
There are many people in the park .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night , so I don &apos;t feel well .
Tom was dumped by his girlfriend .
I want to stay here with you .
Everybody &apos;s different .
Why is Tom good at French ?
Did you say something , dear ?
Tom is tall .
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
They &apos;re all older than you .
About how many books do you have ?
Tom stopped talking when Mary came into the room .
Tom was also there .
How much did you pay for the dress ?
Get back to the ship .
Why don &apos;t you think about it ?
Tom asked Mary to go to the store to buy some bread .
We have enough room for everyone .
I &apos;m satisfied with everything .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say to Tom .
How about I do that ?
I &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t invited .
He has a dog .
How can you eat so much ?
I need someone to talk to Tom .
Why are we even talking about this ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom will come or not .
My father is in the hospital now .
What do you do with these ?
I &apos;m only human .
I only have three dollars on me .
Tom didn &apos;t get a reply .
Can I help you with that ?
Tom asked me if I really wanted to do that by myself .
He moved back with his parents .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
Our son was killed in action .
Do you want Tom to do that ?
Tom is almost as tall as I am .
There is nothing in the world from which we can &apos;t learn something .
That &apos;s OK with Tom .
The war began three years later .
I don &apos;t want it .
We try to keep our promises .
Tom has to do that .
It is impossible for me to help you .
Tom &apos;s best friend is Mary .
Tom sat down with Mary .
It was three days ago .
I don &apos;t need this anymore .
Tom is like that .
That &apos;s not very good .
I forgot her completely .
Tom should &apos;ve listened to you .
I have no one to blame but myself .
What &apos;s that have to do with me ?
We can still talk to Tom .
Are you sure you &apos;re not tired ?
It &apos;s a beautiful job .
How many people are you expecting ?
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mother .
I &apos;ve heard this song before .
Tom has been studying all morning .
She &apos;s never fallen in love .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
I didn &apos;t know that you used to work here .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
People around here often do that .
I know what you do .
Our baby is learning to speak .
I can &apos;t live any longer without him .
Tom can &apos;t speak much French .
I will visit you tomorrow without fail .
He didn &apos;t tell me everything .
She left the room without saying a word .
Tom came by bus .
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say .
Tom hasn &apos;t got much money with him .
I &apos;ll call her immediately .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s brother ?
I &apos;m not mad at you .
I wonder why Tom didn &apos;t call me .
When did you find this ?
Tom should &apos;ve been home from school hours ago .
Tom wanted to say more , but he couldn &apos;t .
I was there yesterday .
Tom knows you &apos;re here .
I want to show you something in my office .
We went to Boston by bus .
I think you look hot .
I think it &apos;s time to start getting ready .
I absolutely agree with you .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
What do they want with us ?
They understood .
This book is older than that one .
Tom sat down and read the paper .
Is it possible ?
They aren &apos;t afraid of death .
The problem is not what he said , but how he said it .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for Mary ?
I think I like it .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
I &apos;ll go find out where Tom is .
I don &apos;t like you either .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Mary ?
I only know what Tom told me .
Why didn &apos;t you phone before coming ?
I &apos;m almost done here .
This is a fun activity for the whole family .
Do you have children already ?
This isn &apos;t supposed to be happening .
I think Tom is expecting us both .
Do you want to see them ?
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
I don &apos;t want you anymore .
They eat meat once a week .
Do you want to tell me what happened ?
Tom might go .
Where &apos;s it from ?
Tom will never understand why we want him to do this .
He himself tried it .
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others .
You don &apos;t want that .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
Tom did what most people would &apos;ve done in the same situation .
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me .
Tom wanted to study with Mary .
I think Tom is up .
City life suits me very well .
I don &apos;t care if you believe me .
She &apos;s happy .
Tom is the only one who saw what happened .
You should come with us .
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Tom searched all day for the letter .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the reason .
Tom was the last one to finish eating .
He was expected to make a decision .
They &apos;ve done it before .
She fell asleep .
I can help you if you let me .
What ? What did you say ?
Japan is not what it was ten years ago .
Give it back .
You must really be proud of yourself .
Tom already knows my opinion .
There &apos;s no such thing as luck .
Tom was in bed all morning .
We &apos;re not home right now .
I &apos;d like you to meet my sister .
I &apos;m getting to it .
I &apos;m dissatisfied .
May I ask about your family ?
Do you want me to go ?
How is the weather ?
I &apos;m here for Tom .
Tom and I used to play tennis together .
Watch us .
He has a large family .
Tom is the only person who knows about this .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
Tom &apos;s alive .
Release Tom .
I brought you some coffee .
I &apos;m sorry for you .
You are as tall as I am .
Tom should &apos;ve asked Mary for help .
He only speaks one language .
Do you know who he was ?
I didn &apos;t ask for help .
She has a big family .
I &apos;m going on vacation next week .
That should be kept between us .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
I will be leaving for Australia next month .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to do that .
The room was filled with people .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
Tom is already there .
I like these .
I had no idea Tom was a doctor .
I thought you had already eaten .
I don &apos;t see what that has to do with this .
You &apos;re right , as always .
His name is known to everyone in this town .
We &apos;re at home today .
Do you have any idea who that was ?
I could &apos;ve met you at the airport .
I hope that you will like it .
Tom is a good person .
I don &apos;t want to know .
If you don &apos;t want to sing , you don &apos;t have to .
I can name names .
I wrote that book .
Tom looked around for his camera .
I don &apos;t speak your language .
I &apos;m a little tired .
Tom may do that .
How did Tom know where Mary was going to be ?
Tom is not at all happy .
A penny for your thoughts .
May I use the phone ?
Tom sat down in front of his computer .
Her father is tall .
Tom can &apos;t read French .
I wish I could come with you .
I waited an hour for my friend .
Tom walked across the room .
Tom sat silently beside Mary .
How do I get to the beach ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to remember .
It could be Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t give me my money back .
Tom barely studied for the exam .
Tom took off .
When did you learn to read ?
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
I hope Tom won &apos;t be disappointed .
Where are you heading ?
Tom called home .
Tom rarely ever does that anymore .
Tom &apos;s free .
It doesn &apos;t look good , does it ?
It &apos;s still possible .
She likes him .
He was giving a speech .
Everything &apos;s OK .
The doctor said that Tom didn &apos;t need to stay in the hospital .
I learned it from you .
Why did you even bother to come ?
We are just in time for the last train .
You can come and see me whenever it &apos;s convenient for you .
May I talk to you ?
Tom remained in Boston for a few days .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s boss .
Where else in Boston do you want to go ?
Tom scarcely said a word .
Tom likes watching TV .
It can &apos;t be that bad .
Can I have your phone number ?
She wouldn &apos;t be happy with him .
I did this for you .
Who is he and what &apos;s his name ?
I &apos;m going to Boston to see Tom .
That &apos;s what I said all along .
Tom sat down on a bench .
How old is Tom now ?
What made you ask Tom that ?
Let me know if you need help .
He made up his mind to be a doctor .
I don &apos;t believe anything Tom says .
You &apos;ve already forgotten .
He wore a coat too large for him .
I know Tom isn &apos;t alone .
Tom started reading .
Our children like dogs , but I prefer cats .
Tom is just a few years older than me .
How do you kids do it ?
Let &apos;s go outside and play in the snow .
Tom got here late .
Tom , can you hear me ?
Do you wish to go ?
Do you know where your children are ?
Tom was too tired to speak .
He takes after his father .
I love you just as you are .
We have a lot of homework .
When did you work in Boston ?
He &apos;s better than us all .
Tom has been asking to see you .
I haven &apos;t yet made plans for next weekend .
Let me try .
Why not take a few days off ?
My mother is making a cake .
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off .
Tom would like to buy a house in Boston .
There &apos;s no one home .
This car is as good as new .
Tom is probably still sleepy .
Just tell me where Tom is .
Tom is a very good boy .
I can &apos;t remember exactly how old I was when I first met Tom .
This is my bicycle .
Tom is hard of hearing .
He doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom said he hated this book .
I know where we are .
What have you been doing all this while ?
Tom took a cab .
Tom allowed Mary to play his guitar .
Get ready quickly .
Did Tom say where we should meet him ?
I hear the sky is very beautiful there .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
We hardly see you anymore .
What is his age ?
How do you know when to stop ?
I want to go to bed early .
Is this your homework ?
I simply don &apos;t know .
We &apos;ve only been dating for a month .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
I &apos;m sorry I let you down .
We should be very careful .
Tom looked very busy .
What languages does Tom speak ?
My mother and I were in the garden all afternoon .
Do you want to do that again ?
Tom likes to read .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
Tom met Mary at work .
English is not spoken here .
We &apos;d like you to come with us .
I asked him to wait here .
Tom wasn &apos;t alone .
I thought it was pretty good .
My mom made it for me .
I suppose I ought to apologize .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
Music is important to me .
Tom &apos;ll speak .
Tom asked Mary questions .
She will be back at five .
I thought I saw someone I knew .
Tom spoke .
I can &apos;t swim any further .
I love you .
Have you ever missed a plane ?
I was worried about you all day .
I wrote this book .
Tom took his seat .
They failed the exam .
The world is evil .
He is better today than yesterday .
What do you want me to see ?
Tom and Mary have gone to Australia .
I am sure I saw her two years ago .
It &apos;s almost summer .
Our cat is missing .
I like being a teacher .
We lost the game .
I have really bad eyes .
Tom wished to be left alone .
There &apos;s something I need to give you .
How &apos;s everyone doing today ?
Tom got up at 6 : 30 as usual .
Why aren &apos;t you in there ?
Tom will die in prison .
This tea is very hot .
I &apos;ll give you this camera .
It won &apos;t last long .
You can &apos;t always make everyone happy .
I do not watch television .
I still love you very much .
I want what Tom has .
Tom is from Australia .
There are no easy answers .
She did the work alone .
I can &apos;t afford a camera as good as yours .
Tom told Mary his phone number .
All three of us are students .
I want to learn to play the guitar .
&quot; Do you think he will come ? &quot; &quot; I hope not . &quot;
You &apos;re not the first person to say so .
Has Tom ever fallen in love ?
Can I go to work ?
I want your opinion .
I think they look good .
What do you do after dinner ?
The old man died last week .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t believe me .
You &apos;re late again .
I already saw this .
It &apos;s late .
Tom seldom watches TV .
They deserve it .
No one knew why .
I want to make her happy .
It &apos;s my job .
What do you think I should write ?
How would you like your eggs ?
I need Tom .
I want to play on the computer .
Does anyone still have a question ?
You can do it at your leisure .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
I called him this morning .
Why are you alone ?
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
I found out what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Have you ever won a prize ?
He writes books .
He won &apos;t talk to her and she won &apos;t talk to him .
I &apos;ll see you in October .
No one knows me like you do .
What kind of reading do you like to do ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like it .
Tom can &apos;t sing .
I &apos;ll take back what I said .
Is this intended for me ?
Tom was taken to the hospital .
I will go at 10 .
When did that happen ?
Tom isn &apos;t at school .
You have to help me .
Do you want me to leave ?
I &apos;ve learned a lot of things from Tom .
My parents don &apos;t know .
What do you do on Sunday ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon .
We want to see it .
What time do you want me to be here ?
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Why are you here ?
Tom is angry with you .
Tom isn &apos;t listening to Mary .
Tom lost his hat .
Tom didn &apos;t buy it after all .
Tom put his shirt on .
They are having lunch in the garden .
What &apos;re you looking at , Tom ?
Where am I now ?
Do you want to go to Boston ?
I have to go to sleep .
I had my camera repaired at that shop .
He may come today .
You will find this game very interesting .
What &apos;s your opinion about that ?
It &apos;s never been done before .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t doing something he isn &apos;t supposed to be doing .
Tom never wanted to study French .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t study at all .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t like to do ?
I worked hard all day long yesterday .
You know I &apos;m telling the truth .
No one is there .
I won &apos;t change my mind .
Everything is fine .
I don &apos;t think Tom will hurt Mary .
Tom died in Australia .
You &apos;re wanted by the police .
Tom wants to take you home .
I &apos;ve heard everything .
Tom has gone to Australia .
No one likes it .
He &apos;s in trouble .
Please don &apos;t get up .
I would never have guessed that .
I already spoke to Tom .
Tom said that he was sleepy .
I like to study French .
We are having lunch .
How do I look ?
You should know it .
I spoke to him about it on the telephone .
Get serious .
Tom isn &apos;t as young as I am .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
We got married a few years ago .
Tom can &apos;t say for sure how many times Mary has been to Boston .
Tom wants to go to the movies .
It was your idea .
I want these .
Listen to this !
Neither of my parents can sing very well .
I do think I understand .
Tom knows what &apos;s expected .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about it .
I need a doctor .
Something has happened .
Let &apos;s take a bus .
She is as beautiful as her mother .
She bought a book at the shop .
That &apos;ll make me happy .
I &apos;ve got big hands .
Tom didn &apos;t know anything about Mary .
They &apos;re not good .
It &apos;ll be hard to find someone to do that .
Tom says he can &apos;t give me what I want .
Tom is almost never late .
Nobody will know .
The song was a big hit .
We &apos;ve come home .
I wrote a letter .
This has happened before .
Mary isn &apos;t as beautiful as Alice .
They &apos;re very busy .
Did you call me up last night ?
This is where I was born .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
I am sure .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
It &apos;s too expensive .
Today , we turn ten years old .
You are very rich .
Here is the car .
How did you first meet Tom ?
It is rare for him to get angry .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be anything else but a teacher .
Aren &apos;t you scared ?
They say that he was in the hospital at that time .
I don &apos;t believe you .
They could not find work at home .
How may I help you ?
I am tired because I had to study for this exam last night .
Did you make it ?
My wife thinks I &apos;m crazy .
When is school out ?
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what time it is .
I believe that &apos;s correct .
What time are you coming over tonight ?
Have you ever done it ?
Tom spoke again .
I &apos;ve already paid for the first lesson .
Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us .
I like it out here .
I have many friends in foreign countries .
What time is your bus ?
How about going swimming ?
I don &apos;t approve of it .
May I have one of these ?
Tom is having dinner .
Tom is safe now .
I &apos;ll start .
Time is running out .
My watch isn &apos;t working properly .
Tom wanted to meet me .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do it without you .
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
Tom is very good at doing that .
Can you answer this question ?
We have to get to the bottom of that .
You &apos;ve both been very helpful .
This tea is very good .
I have plenty of time .
I thought that you were my best friend .
It will take some time before he understands it .
Don &apos;t be late to school again .
I had my bicycle fixed by my brother .
She can &apos;t swim .
Who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
I don &apos;t know who you are and I don &apos;t care .
Tom has nothing to do with it .
Tom blamed Mary .
A friend is hard to find and easy to lose .
I also have a sister .
I can not answer your question .
Tom never lets anyone do anything .
I speak nothing but the truth .
What exactly did you do ?
It &apos;s not safe here .
Where were they born ?
I don &apos;t intend to go to Boston with you .
You have no right to do this .
I don &apos;t want to do that for Tom .
I brought you some coffee .
Tom put the book on the desk .
I think I know you .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I misunderstood .
Tom needs somebody to help him .
It started to rain .
Tom is now almost as tall as his father is .
I went to the bank .
Nothing is the matter with me .
I never learned how to swim .
My father asked me to open the window .
Where did you learn to dance like this ?
The train leaves in 5 minutes .
You don &apos;t want this , do you ?
She &apos;s a good person .
I don &apos;t want to go with Tom .
I &apos;d like a book .
He is a doctor .
Tom told me that he needed some money .
That &apos;s the one .
We are at home .
Tom is much better than you .
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom made us do the work .
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston .
I gave one to Tom , too .
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston .
What are we supposed to do with it ?
Tom saw her .
Tom is in big trouble .
I &apos;m mad at both of you .
Tom walked Mary home .
May I stay with you for a few days ?
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
I made that for you .
I &apos;m very hungry today .
Tom has plenty of money .
She talked a lot .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
What do you want to do today ?
She takes dinner to his house every evening .
They look good .
She pretended that she knew nothing about it .
What happened to Tom ?
What kind of flowers do you like ?
What does Tom think about it ?
We should &apos;ve both stayed awake .
Tom is teaching French to Mary .
Tom must have been at home at that time .
I see what &apos;s going on .
Where did they learn this ?
We never talked about that again .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel like talking to Mary .
I know something is wrong , but I &apos;m not quite sure what .
Tom usually goes to school by bus .
Can Tom come tomorrow ?
I will see them next week .
Tom isn &apos;t ready .
I can &apos;t answer your question .
I &apos;ll meet her tomorrow .
I &apos;ll be in the kitchen .
You need friends .
Nobody waits for me .
I just have one question .
That &apos;s right !
How did you come by these books ?
I &apos;ll go to the hospital .
Are these your own books ?
I think Tom is from Australia .
Father usually comes home at eight .
I can &apos;t picture Tom doing that .
I asked Tom if he understood .
I &apos;m afraid of Tom .
I don &apos;t care how long ago it was .
Tom will never know it was you who told me .
Tom told me that he was happy .
I &apos;d like to see someone do better .
The clock is ten minutes slow .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll take long .
It &apos;s so nice to be back .
Tom asked me for my phone number .
Tom works very hard , but not as hard as Mary .
Let &apos;s ask the teacher .
I know who lives in that house .
My sister is driving me crazy .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom is telling the truth .
She is proud that her son has become a doctor .
The old man fell down on the ground .
It makes perfect sense .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is called in English .
I &apos;m busy now .
Tom gave Mary three dollars and John thirty dollars .
Maybe we shouldn &apos;t have taken this road .
I was so disappointed .
You have to believe in yourself .
I really wish I could help .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to drive drunk .
Come with us .
Did you get their letter ?
You don &apos;t scare me .
That &apos;s what you said last time .
You &apos;re here early .
His advice didn &apos;t help at all .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
Is this your book ?
Tom bought a shirt yesterday .
Who are you talking about ?
I &apos;m very glad to see you .
Let me see that .
Tom and Mary walked to their car .
Tom and Mary are getting married next weekend .
Tom is quite likely to be late .
I called him up , but he wasn &apos;t there .
I don &apos;t know if he will visit us next Sunday .
My children won &apos;t eat fish .
He isn &apos;t running .
Should I come with you ?
Tom and I are doing fine .
All we want to do is eat .
I &apos;m OK .
I need Tom &apos;s money .
How much did you pay ?
I can explain it to you if you let me .
Do you want to play ?
You ask questions about everything .
This dress is much too large for me .
Hardly anyone ever comes to visit me .
Who saw me ?
Here &apos;s some water .
Help !
I was lost in the crowd .
Tom is much older than Mary .
What &apos;s your cat &apos;s name ?
Tom stood nearby .
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to a movie with me .
This isn &apos;t a new car .
Do you know that ?
It &apos;s about time .
Can I get a little assistance here ?
Tom really likes Mary .
It &apos;s likely Tom knows Mary &apos;s phone number .
Tom &apos;s parents have a lot of money .
That is quite another matter .
I don &apos;t really like to talk about it .
You must not do that anymore .
Do you want to do it ?
You know I didn &apos;t mean it .
Did you find someone to help you ?
Tom didn &apos;t like my idea .
What &apos;s his name again ?
Did you enjoy that ?
I &apos;m feeling a little nervous right now .
I wanted to see what would happen .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t hungry .
You are as tall as my sister .
I didn &apos;t want that to happen .
Nobody cares what you think .
What do we have ?
You don &apos;t look happy .
Let me introduce you to my parents .
I do that for Tom .
I met Tom at his house .
Are you satisfied , Tom ?
Are you busy now ?
I remember them .
We &apos;ll see you when we get home .
I can &apos;t go , nor do I want to .
Tell me where I can find Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t think before he speaks .
What I &apos;m telling you is true .
You &apos;re not going to like this .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
I &apos;ll say it again .
I don &apos;t see any reason why I have to apologize .
I &apos;ll take care of this .
Do you feel like eating something ?
I love him .
I &apos;d love to have one of those .
I saw it with my own eyes .
This isn &apos;t good for Tom .
I met Tom tonight .
Tom began singing .
We &apos;re standing .
Tom pulled Mary out of the car .
Tom seemed nervous .
You don &apos;t need to answer that letter .
He did as I told him .
She can play the piano very well .
Tom has to stay in Australia for one more week .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary here ?
Why don &apos;t you watch TV ?
&quot; I &apos;m not good at swimming . &quot; &quot; Neither am I. &quot;
It &apos;s no big thing .
I don &apos;t even know your real name .
I can wait no longer .
You might &apos;ve been able to do that if Tom had helped you .
What &apos;s the good of having a car if you don &apos;t drive ?
Tom has bad eyes .
I said take it .
Tom called Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a car .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid .
Tom said Mary wouldn &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Tom is as tall as Mary .
I no longer need them .
Do you want breakfast ?
He was killed instantly .
I think Tom gets the idea .
It &apos;s not my business .
I will be back soon .
Tom bought a camera yesterday .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Tom found out the truth from Mary .
That &apos;s not bad .
I saw Tom do that .
That &apos;s what I like to do .
I came to see how you &apos;re doing .
I don &apos;t think Tom has met Mary yet .
This isn &apos;t my home .
Let &apos;s wait until Monday .
Do you have a car ?
There is no milk left .
This is the one I &apos;ll use .
You have no idea who that is , do you ?
Did Tom tell you ?
Tom often helps me with my homework .
Is Tom stupid ?
Tom knows about this already .
I want to learn French .
I don &apos;t know much about your family .
I understood nothing .
I wonder what Tom is reading now .
Tom didn &apos;t believe Mary .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Tom lost his friends .
I thought you might change your mind .
He said to himself , &quot; I will do it . &quot;
Tom likes Mary , and so do I .
No one was awake yet .
I don &apos;t see why .
Tom pondered his next move .
Where &apos;s our car ?
We always want what we can &apos;t have .
He dozed off .
I want to be able to speak French .
What &apos;s Tom going to do with it ?
Tom is no longer living here .
Nothing ever happens here .
Every bus is full .
That &apos;s the way Tom always does it .
What Tom really wanted was a good friend he could talk to .
I don &apos;t have much money on me .
The only language that Tom can speak is French .
Tom hasn &apos;t spoken to me about it yet .
He &apos;s not my boyfriend .
I want Mary .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
She got sick this weekend .
Do you want a little cake ?
That has always been so .
I hear the phone .
You have to go home .
Who can do this work ?
He gave up his life for his country .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
You should have one of us do it .
Tom will go alone .
Is there a restaurant around here ?
I wish I were rich enough to buy a car like that .
You must learn French .
Tom said that he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom said Mary was really drunk .
Men don &apos;t drive as well as women .
You made too many mistakes .
Can we afford this ?
If I had time , I would study French .
I can stay with Tom for a couple of weeks .
This might be over soon .
He has bought a new car .
Tom is somewhere in the building .
You might not find it .
My dog often pretends to be asleep .
Tom believes whatever I say .
What would you like for breakfast ?
This is the book Tom gave me .
How many times do I have to explain this to you ?
If he knew the truth , he would tell us .
Tom and Mary must be very hungry .
They love it .
It &apos;s much better now .
I &apos;m on my way to visit a friend in the hospital .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
I &apos;m disappointed and angry .
I don &apos;t like that .
Tom must care about you very much .
I &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t invited .
Tom didn &apos;t want that .
Your dog is very fat .
You cannot do this .
I &apos;m taking tomorrow afternoon off .
How did it go ?
What newspaper do you read ?
I have a few questions for you .
Do you have a problem with me ?
We can &apos;t just let Tom leave .
Everyone &apos;s busy .
I was looking for you .
This job pays very well .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
Tom and I get along fine .
When was the last time you played tennis with Tom ?
He &apos;s the one who told me about that .
My son is small for his age .
This problem is too hard for me to solve .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
You missed the meeting .
I don &apos;t like English .
I &apos;d rather walk than wait for a bus .
Tom has a small garden .
Tom had his camera stolen .
The train was about to leave the station .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
What do you think I should write ?
Do you know why she &apos;s so angry ?
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
Tom saw Mary driving her new car .
That &apos;ll help .
That girl isn &apos;t able to ride a bicycle .
I know where I &apos;m going .
Tom isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do that without Tom &apos;s help .
I may have hurt his feelings .
Tom wanted to become a doctor .
Tom has been to Boston only once .
This book is easy enough for children to read .
It doesn &apos;t concern you .
I &apos;m your father .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
It was very simple .
Everyone knows .
Go and find Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it .
Have you already started learning French ?
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s friend .
Tom is happy again .
Nobody wants you to do that .
She brought me a cup of tea .
That doesn &apos;t surprise me .
&quot; Where is your father ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have one . &quot;
I go to work by car every day .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as Tom .
Tom is just about as old as I am .
Dinner will be ready soon .
Please wait thirty minutes .
I think you &apos;re being a little too careful .
Why do I have to do it ?
It should be fun doing that .
How could I help it ?
Tom went to the airport .
Everyone laughed at me yesterday .
She &apos;s taller than him .
Tom started dancing .
There &apos;s a new boy in school .
This could be a mistake .
I &apos;m sorry Tom isn &apos;t here .
Let &apos;s meet again soon .
Where &apos;s your school ?
Mary eats less than her sister does .
I wish I could tell you the reason , but I can &apos;t .
How does Tom look ?
Tom is about thirty .
Tom says he enjoys studying French .
My house is very cold .
I asked Tom to do that .
What made you ask that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
This sort of thing doesn &apos;t usually happen .
I wish Tom was here .
Tom wants an apple .
Are you sure he can do this ?
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t much help .
You think you know me pretty well , don &apos;t you ?
They have lived in London for ten years .
Is this your dictionary ?
Why aren &apos;t you there ?
Does that satisfy you ?
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
I fell in love with you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to like this .
I am 30 years old now .
Don &apos;t be too sure .
I am going to see the doctor this afternoon .
Are these books yours or mine ?
Tom seemed to be worried about me .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
I &apos;m used to being tired .
We &apos;ll never work for Tom .
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t there .
Is Tom at school ?
You need a vacation .
I can &apos;t give those to you .
This isn &apos;t for you .
That did me good .
I understand why you &apos;re here .
Did you meet her ?
I have good news .
You look nervous .
I deserve more .
We &apos;re not going to do that .
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
I think I ate a little too much today .
How was work today ?
You should tell him the truth .
We &apos;re always hungry .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I am not well at all .
Tom asked again .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
You &apos;re not as important as you think you are .
I &apos;m not going to do it .
He doesn &apos;t have a sister .
How fast was Tom driving ?
Tom sat beside Mary on the bench .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well yet .
Tom is quite tall .
It &apos;s always been that way .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
Did Tom like Boston ?
I &apos;d like to go with you .
I &apos;ll make you a drink .
She &apos;s very beautiful .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
This task is difficult .
No one believed him .
Tom is on his way to work .
I &apos;ll do anything but that .
What &apos;ll you have ?
He showed off his new watch .
Tom told me to leave the room immediately .
Tom hardly ever listens to music .
Everyone makes mistakes .
I love you more and more every day .
I don &apos;t want your money .
Tom need not have worried .
We &apos;ll help you out .
It &apos;s very hot .
I don &apos;t know where to wait for her .
I &apos;m going to Boston this weekend .
Tom has lived in Australia for over thirty years .
How long do you think it &apos;ll take ?
Why don &apos;t we take a taxi ?
We are all anxious about your health .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
I hate coffee .
I &apos;ll be with Tom .
You understand why , don &apos;t you ?
Why is Tom leaving school ?
Where is your money ?
Is Tom happy ?
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Let &apos;s do it again .
You need this .
There &apos;s nothing I really have to do today .
Tom is sure Mary is right .
This question is too difficult for me .
Tom was in Australia last month .
When are you going to do that ?
I don &apos;t want that .
You haven &apos;t got a chance .
Tom helps anybody that asks him for help .
The house is pretty .
When Tom was young , he ate three eggs every day .
Tom wants to see you .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
Tom loves Mary more than I do .
Tom may have missed the train . He hasn &apos;t come yet .
Are you sure about this ?
What don &apos;t you want us to see ?
You may ask any questions you wish .
He &apos;s still young .
Children shouldn &apos;t drink wine .
Tom is the one we want .
He tried hard , but failed .
She made him happy .
I went there .
Tom knew nothing .
I will tell you about him .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell me .
I need your help , Tom .
When do you return home ?
Tom has never asked me for money .
I &apos;ll stay .
I &apos;ll be there on Monday .
Give it to me .
I am better .
Would you please show me how it &apos;s done ?
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along too well .
I wonder if Tom can hear us .
Asking questions is a good way to learn .
We need to do it immediately .
Let him do it .
I am not the person I used to be .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m still alive .
I believe this is mine .
The situation hasn &apos;t improved .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Has Tom told Mary that he &apos;s married ?
He put the key on the desk as usual .
I really wish there was something I could do .
I can &apos;t quit now .
Tom could speak French .
He seems hungry .
This is the way he learned English .
She and I are the same age .
He said that he was hungry .
I &apos;ll be done in an hour .
I &apos;m going out with Tom .
You &apos;re a good friend .
No one loves you as much as I do .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t need to know about this .
Which is your bag ?
I don &apos;t want to be married to you anymore .
Tom gave me something that I needed .
The girl seems to be rich .
Can I eat this ?
What were Tom and Mary supposed to do ?
Did you invite Tom ?
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
I don &apos;t like the way he talks .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour or so .
That &apos;s not how you do it .
I have bad news for you .
I &apos;ll love you always .
Do you like to live in the country ?
I love my life .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy .
They &apos;re looking for it .
Tom couldn &apos;t walk .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand me the way you do .
I remember it now .
What were you and Tom doing yesterday ?
Tom and I walk to school together .
Tom bought another hat .
It &apos;s impossible to fix .
How many years have you been married ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s horse .
Can you get it repaired ?
Did you study French in high school ?
The baby cannot walk yet .
Tom looked very tired when he got home .
You are welcome to the use of our house while we are away on vacation .
He said nothing .
My father loves to play the guitar .
She takes a walk with her dog .
I read your letter yesterday .
We can win .
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was married .
We didn &apos;t have school today .
All of my children want to go to Australia .
Most people here don &apos;t know how to drive .
He was absent from school yesterday because he was sick .
Is Tom nearby ?
I bought a hat .
How many times a week do you study French ?
Let &apos;s finish this work as soon as possible .
I &apos;m driving to Boston tomorrow to visit Tom .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
It &apos;s almost October .
I have already written a letter .
Tom told me he was studying French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to do that .
You &apos;re not even paying attention .
I don &apos;t like the house he lives in .
The problem here isn &apos;t me .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do so .
I &apos;ll get one .
Are you telling me how to do my job ?
He wears glasses .
The weather is beautiful .
Tom seems to be angry , but not as angry as Mary .
It is very small .
Life doesn &apos;t get any better .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
We want to see Tom do that .
Tom is experienced .
Could you tell me how to get to the station ?
I &apos;m going to study French this afternoon .
We have one for you , too .
Tom could do it .
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
You didn &apos;t actually see anything , did you ?
It &apos;s out of the question .
I kept on reading .
This watch is expensive .
How do you put up with it ?
Why are you being so nice to me ?
She is out of her mind .
He may not come .
Do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
Are you there , Tom ?
You know where the problem lies .
It was easy for me to do so .
The problem is we don &apos;t know where Tom is .
Tom is from Boston .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
Tom has definitely been here before .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I don &apos;t like what you said about Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary got married .
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow .
Tom won &apos;t tell me exactly why he was late .
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
I still think about her from time to time .
Can I do anything for you ?
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
Do you know when Tom &apos;s birthday is ?
Tom looked calm .
Did you do that ?
Where do you want this ?
Tom attributed his success to Mary &apos;s help .
My father is always busy .
I wish I had seen her .
Let &apos;s get started .
He doesn &apos;t work here now , but he used to work here .
Tom and Mary think they know everything .
Tom already knows the truth .
She was already in love with him .
Tom waited a moment and then got up to leave .
He &apos;s living from hand to mouth .
Would you like a cup of coffee ?
Tom just sat there saying nothing .
I cannot do the work on my own .
We &apos;re all right .
Meet me in an hour .
What would I do with that ?
It &apos;s way too heavy .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
I &apos;m here to take Tom home .
Tom told me Mary is in jail .
Is that all you want ?
How do you know what I said ?
You must show me how it works .
Do it whenever you want .
We &apos;re all going .
They don &apos;t speak French here .
Did you talk to Tom about it ?
I watch TV now and then .
I wanted to say yes .
I hope Tom is unafraid .
That &apos;s impossible .
She has a very good voice .
Tom is living with his family .
I saw Tom doing that yesterday .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom does .
I can speak French better than Tom .
Tom has no right to say that .
Tom left my bag at the hotel .
I bought this guitar for just thirty dollars .
I asked Tom if he wanted to drive .
I just want to be your friend , nothing more .
You know Tom has a thing for you .
We &apos;re winning .
I don &apos;t see a problem with it .
Tom got into his car .
It won &apos;t take me a long time .
They have already begun .
Do you smoke ?
I hate working .
Tom made Mary do that .
Tom has left the building .
That &apos;s a plan .
Tom isn &apos;t exactly welcome here .
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
Tom was planning on doing that tomorrow .
He ran so he would get there on time .
I &apos;m busy all the time .
This clock isn &apos;t working .
Everyone has a right to say what he thinks .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
Why did you help me ?
I think Tom is looking at us .
Nobody wants you to do that .
We &apos;re very proud of you .
I &apos;d like to call him . Do you have his phone number ?
The kid already speaks pretty well .
You look very happy .
I &apos;d like to help you , but I &apos;m a bit busy right now .
I would rather die than do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to know .
Tom and Mary hardly know each other .
I have been studying French four years now .
He got married three days ago .
Tom isn &apos;t sure .
Tom can ride a bicycle .
I know you &apos;re Tom .
You &apos;ll learn how to do it sooner or later .
Nobody can help you .
I saw her only a week ago .
I made Tom go there .
I &apos;m not even sure if this is my key .
You are impossible .
We &apos;ll leave at eight o &apos;clock .
You need a key .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
The one who has everything can lose everything .
He lost his life in an accident .
We &apos;re doing what we have to do .
He played tennis yesterday .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
You can ask Tom for help .
I sat beside her .
I want to live forever .
I won &apos;t help Tom again .
I know somebody who speaks French very well .
This book can &apos;t go into the bag .
We &apos;ve always done it this way .
She kept me waiting for a long time .
Do you have a knife ?
Tom didn &apos;t have much to say .
Have you found something ?
We &apos;re all alone .
His old cat is still alive .
We &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
Tom told everybody that Mary knew how to do that .
Tom is in a meeting , but Mary &apos;s in her office .
You have to take this .
We have a lot of things that need to be done .
Tom is a friend from school .
I don &apos;t deserve it .
They &apos;ll understand .
I think what you need now is to eat something .
The coffee &apos;s ready .
If only I had left home five minutes earlier .
Both Tom and I don &apos;t understand French at all .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
I didn &apos;t need Tom .
What if Tom is right ?
There &apos;s nothing else to do .
Tom tried to hide his feelings .
I know a little French .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand that at all .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want anything .
Can I come ?
Do you really live alone ?
He didn &apos;t say a single word .
This is not for me .
I was a little nervous .
I &apos;m your best friend .
I should &apos;ve been there sooner .
You know I &apos;m married .
I can hear something .
We have no school tomorrow .
Where is your friend ?
Tom is the one we want .
I saw the message .
What &apos;s wrong with this ?
Be nice .
Can you come for dinner tonight ?
How are things going ?
I have a lot of work to do today .
He wants to come .
Tom is like Mary .
I am eating an apple .
You &apos;d better leave now .
Have some .
I had a wonderful time .
Shut the door tight .
I know everyone here by name .
That belongs to Tom .
Tom asked me to give you this .
Tom has plenty of money in the bank .
Did you understand what he said ?
We can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom we saw .
You don &apos;t know my dad , do you ?
How many apples do you want ?
Tom left Australia three weeks ago .
I &apos;ll do that later .
Have you decided on a name for your baby ?
When did you work in Boston ?
Do you want to hang out at my place ?
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary .
Tom &apos;s wounded .
I made these for you .
They &apos;ll understand us .
I am glad to see her .
Tell Tom he has to do that today .
My mom is worried .
Can you tell me anything else ?
Tom needs to buy a gift for Mary .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand French well .
The fish he caught yesterday is still alive .
Tom ran to catch the train .
I really liked talking to Tom .
It is a book .
Please remember to come and see us this weekend .
I &apos;d like to work for you as long as possible .
Tom thought that Mary was busy .
Tom got very busy .
Your question has no answer .
Give it to me !
Why is Tom still standing outside in the rain ?
That is a very good thing .
Watch how I do it .
I went home .
You don &apos;t want me to do that .
We haven &apos;t seen you in the past four years .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
I don &apos;t have to go , but you do .
I would like to see it .
I just can &apos;t get along with him .
I can &apos;t let you do that .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
Tom asked me if I was happy .
That doesn &apos;t help me .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t talk to each other anymore .
We &apos;re getting there .
Tom kept his promise to Mary .
I &apos;m coming in October .
Where did you two meet ?
Tom knows that &apos;s no good .
I don &apos;t remember who gave this to me .
Is Tom hot ?
I know where they are .
Why is he so nice to me ?
When did you begin learning French ?
You worked hard .
Tom has no idea what Mary is thinking .
You &apos;d better go .
What do you know about what happened ?
I had no reason to stay .
Tom is only a few years older than me .
I am not frightened of anything .
Tom didn &apos;t quit .
Are you sure you want to do it ?
How would you help Tom ?
Stop talking about Tom .
Tom knows we can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom never came home .
What time is the last train ?
I &apos;m better .
Tom was careful .
You need to have breakfast .
That &apos;s what I want from you .
Give me the keys .
Tom seldom makes mistakes .
He is two years older than you .
Tom lost sight of Mary in the crowd .
I can &apos;t remember what I ate last night .
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think so .
I forgot to tell them .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
If it hadn &apos;t been for his advice , I couldn &apos;t have succeeded .
Tom is too old for Mary .
This is my cat .
I hope that helps .
We want to know why Tom did it .
Do you think people will make fun of me ?
Why don &apos;t we take a taxi ?
Nobody loves war .
It looks like Tom is done .
He has no children .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
She introduced her sister to him .
Tom and I are giving up .
Do you even care ?
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
This is the book that I told you about .
Now and then she plays tennis .
I thought you might want it .
Yesterday he came back late .
There &apos;s very little we can do now .
I asked Tom how his job was going .
I &apos;ve never worked in Boston .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
You &apos;ll have to go to Boston to meet Tom next week .
Where are my glasses ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to rain today .
It &apos;s been ten years since I came to this town .
Who was the woman you were talking to ?
Mary doesn &apos;t love her husband .
Where did you find that dress ?
I don &apos;t actually believe that .
I think about him all the time .
I &apos;m going to make you a drink .
Let me help you with that .
I think you should do it .
Tom hasn &apos;t called Mary yet .
Who doesn &apos;t do that ?
Don &apos;t you want me to go with you ?
It is important for me .
Maybe Tom was right .
I thought Tom already knew about that .
I take it back .
Tom has already left for work .
How many times have you done this ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom told you .
Tom put some clothes on .
We want to know why .
It &apos;s not a secret .
Tom said it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
How long &apos;s Tom been gone ?
Would you like it now ?
He will come tomorrow .
Can you speak French ?
That can &apos;t be it .
I am not coming today .
How do you know that &apos;s where Tom is now ?
It &apos;s always like that .
What a night !
We didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
Who are your parents ?
I like it in Boston .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
I have no books to read .
It &apos;s really hot there .
I don &apos;t know English .
I think we should do it .
Tom is just trying to scare you .
All I have is one book .
I &apos;m going back .
Tom walks quickly .
Look at that dog .
I know your father .
Does Tom have any family ?
I have it with me .
Tom spends a lot of money on books .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I have one of those , too .
That &apos;s simple .
Isn &apos;t Tom handsome ?
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
We were expecting it .
How beautiful she is !
Tom gave Mary a book .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to cook very well .
Watch closely .
I &apos;m going away for a month .
Shall I come next Sunday ?
He &apos;s standing on his head .
I don &apos;t ever want to see Tom again .
My car is not running .
I &apos;m drunk .
Are you correct ?
He makes life miserable for everyone around him .
I &apos;m not evil .
You must on no account do such a thing .
This is my question .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
It has begun .
Tom made it on time .
It sure is hot .
Tom told you something , didn &apos;t he ?
Tom was always different from other children .
I was able to find the street , but I couldn &apos;t find her house .
My father is a good speaker of English .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
We found them here .
Tom is very dangerous .
Now that you are no longer young , you must think of your future .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
No one was there .
They don &apos;t talk to us anymore .
Who bought you this ?
Tom is more scared of Mary than she is of him .
Where are you taking Tom ?
He knows my wife .
It made Tom happy .
Who will you be coming with ?
Nobody knows that better than you .
We &apos;re staying .
I &apos;d be happy to sing for you .
I only wanted to talk to Tom .
If I were him , I wouldn &apos;t put up with it .
Is Father in the kitchen ?
Isn &apos;t that the truth ?
I &apos;ll go if you go .
Could you do it ?
Tom may win .
You &apos;re invited .
Tom and I both work .
Tom knows we &apos;re here .
I like English .
I have a friend living in Boston .
What did you eat when you were in Australia ?
Tom got off his horse .
Tom was badly wounded .
Can you believe that ?
I went to see a movie with Tom after school .
Tom is very fast .
Are you still awake ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
The money is gone .
I want to study history .
I know you said that .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I want to visit Boston , too .
I couldn &apos;t understand a word Tom said .
She appears to have many friends .
What are you doing here in Boston ?
I think you know what I think .
Hey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
They are teachers .
Here &apos;s my phone number .
They know that .
Why not take a few days off ?
I know your language .
Tom &apos;s not home .
How long have you been waiting ?
Is the coffee hot ?
I &apos;m very , very happy .
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
Let &apos;s talk over a cup of coffee .
We &apos;re going to wait until Tom gets here .
I wonder if Tom can come .
I &apos;m feeling tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will come .
I don &apos;t know how to help Tom .
We don &apos;t get along with each other .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy , does he ?
Tom isn &apos;t certain .
Tom took off his glasses .
Are you finished with your work ?
Tom is going to be a father .
Please give me a cup of milk .
Everybody probably thinks I &apos;m crazy .
I didn &apos;t sleep at all last night .
If I were you , I &apos;d ask him .
I can sing it in English .
You must show me how it works .
Tom went straight home after work .
He arrived shortly after .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
We have to find Tom .
I made no promises .
Where do they live ?
Here &apos;s where they usually have dinner .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
You can &apos;t leave me .
I have no clue .
I suppose I &apos;d better go .
We &apos;re not really going out in this rain , are we ?
We can &apos;t be sure , can we ?
A trip to America this summer is out of the question .
Where did you buy that book ?
What does that have to do with you ?
I &apos;m ready to go .
I have no choice .
That is how the accident occurred .
How long ago did Tom leave ?
You may read this book .
I visited Tom .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s a doctor .
I &apos;ll come to your place .
Yesterday , Tom told me he didn &apos;t know how to swim .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
Are you free now ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like my dog .
Mary has a beautiful voice .
I didn &apos;t see that .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
Do you really want to wear that ?
It wasn &apos;t hard .
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone why he was late .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else to eat ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
We could walk there together .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
It &apos;s cold today .
The cat doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
I don &apos;t see it .
Tom knows better .
Why do you think Tom is here ?
It doesn &apos;t matter much .
Tom didn &apos;t want to hear anything I had to say .
This hat goes together with the dress .
I want breakfast in my room .
My bicycle was stolen .
He is my teacher .
Tom won &apos;t come , and Mary won &apos;t either .
I don &apos;t know him at all .
Never be this late again .
I &apos;ve already told you what I think .
He still loves her .
You don &apos;t need to go there if you don &apos;t want to .
I came to see you .
They are at lunch .
Can you take me to the airport , please ?
That &apos;s exactly what he wanted .
Tom is quiet now .
I want you to know that I &apos;ll always love you .
I &apos;ve never had to work very hard .
Tom wants to be with us .
You can &apos;t even help yourself .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt Tom .
How &apos;re you doing at home ?
We need money .
You don &apos;t really care about me .
I &apos;m going to tell you everything .
We have more apples than we could eat in a day .
What &apos;re you doing today ?
Why didn &apos;t you ask me ?
That house is small , but it &apos;s big enough for us .
Supper &apos;s getting cold .
I &apos;m sure that you will succeed .
Please explain why you can &apos;t come .
I found out where Tom used to live .
It &apos;s no use crying over spilt milk .
I helped my father with the work .
I have no homework today .
What do you see here ?
Tom isn &apos;t rich .
He &apos;s already a man .
Tom has a sister about your age .
Tom often doesn &apos;t come to school .
You &apos;re better than I am .
Is the boss there ?
I &apos;m hit !
They look very tired .
Tom isn &apos;t tired .
I believed in Tom .
You ought to do it at once .
Why don &apos;t you understand ?
Tom looks happy today .
Tell Tom yourself .
I just wanted to listen to some music .
Why are we going to Australia ?
I want you here tomorrow by 2 : 30 .
I hope your Tom will soon be better .
Did you see Tom in the park ?
Tom was at home alone .
Tom had some questions he needed answered .
Tom quit school .
He is practically dead .
A new dress was bought for her .
You haven &apos;t even tried .
Now you &apos;ve hurt my feelings .
You shouldn &apos;t go .
I will do what I need to do .
Do you think anyone can see me ?
I wanted to marry him .
She will be able to answer your question .
We know about that .
I want to show Tom around town .
Tom wondered whether Mary would like the gift he bought her .
How shall I put it ?
You &apos;re hard to understand .
I really should be getting to bed .
Tom &apos;s not here .
My father bought me the book .
Tell me the truth .
We &apos;ll find them .
He has been dead for ten years .
I told you Tom would help us out .
He lives on this street .
Tom is used to living alone .
She looks like a boy .
I &apos;ve given you my answer already .
I still haven &apos;t learned to drive a car .
Tom goes to school with Mary .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
Tom will like this .
I don &apos;t see why not .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
I have to win .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
Tell Tom where we &apos;re going .
You forgot my birthday .
I hate it when you &apos;re right .
Where can we meet you ?
Make sure you tell Tom .
Tom often stays up all night .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to sleep on the bus .
Don &apos;t go in my room .
That &apos;s not nice .
His wife opened the door for him .
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
I need a little time .
Have you been in Boston long ?
We can solve this problem easily .
That &apos;s what I wanted to ask .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
You &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s too good to be true .
It &apos;s not Monday .
What do you want me to ask Tom ?
Who invited you to the party ?
I speak French fairly well , but not as well as I speak English .
What don &apos;t you like about your family ?
Where does your grandpa live ?
Who &apos;s working tonight ?
Everyone &apos;s going .
We get along really well .
Tom can play tennis very well .
Tom asked Mary to help .
We can &apos;t help you now .
Tom lives near me .
No one knows anything .
I said I &apos;d do it .
I hurt the same way you hurt .
That is my dog .
Who talked ?
The dog likes you .
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
Let &apos;s just pretend like we don &apos;t know each other .
He arrived at the station .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
We &apos;re special .
Tom died three weeks ago in Australia .
Tom saw nothing .
She came into the room .
I only hope you &apos;re right .
I love you more than he loves you .
Who gave this to Tom ?
If you need help , all you have to do is call .
Stop that !
He broke his word .
This is the best movie I &apos;ve ever seen .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Tom and I aren &apos;t permitted to do that anymore .
You know him .
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
My brother earns half as much money as my father .
Aren &apos;t you happy , Tom ?
Tom told me he isn &apos;t going to do that .
I don &apos;t want to have kids , but I want to get married .
He should come right away !
I &apos;m thirty .
You &apos;re better off without me .
Tom put milk in his coffee .
I have a dog and two cats .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
That will put you in danger .
It &apos;s almost seven . We have to go to school .
It &apos;s new .
The day is getting longer and longer .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I just need to ask Tom some questions .
Don &apos;t make fun of old people .
Why did she come home early ?
I can try it .
Keep the kids inside .
I forget her name .
He doesn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom . I can &apos;t do it .
I know what you mean .
I don &apos;t want anything to drink .
The company raised money for new computers .
I have just what you need .
I don &apos;t have a house anymore .
Tom has been found .
Tom knew that he was supposed to be doing something else .
I know what &apos;s right .
I need to see it now .
He isn &apos;t afraid of death .
This hat &apos;s too small for you .
Tom is the only boy in his class .
She won &apos;t be pleased .
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice .
Does Mary have a boyfriend , yet ?
Tom is helping .
I don &apos;t know what that is .
Tom says he can &apos;t wait any longer .
You know what I like .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
You should find somebody else to help you .
Tom and I often eat lunch together .
Do you really want to stay young forever ?
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
How long does it take to get there from here ?
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s just not enough .
I &apos;d like to dance with you .
I &apos;m sorry , my father &apos;s not here .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
I had to go back to Boston .
People are leaving rural areas and moving into cities .
Do you have a plan ?
I read a book while eating .
I &apos;ve always wondered what it would be like to be rich .
I would like to show you my beautiful city .
Have you ever forgotten your phone number ?
I &apos;m going to tell you everything .
Tom , I &apos;d like you to meet someone .
Tom may be home .
Tom is at home almost every evening .
She is good at speaking English .
Where were you born ?
The world is not what it used to be .
What have you ever done for us ?
Tom and Mary will know what to do .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like me .
Where did you two meet ?
It &apos;s not a gift .
You &apos;d better go back home now .
Tom quickly closed the door .
He seems to be rich now .
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom .
Your question is very hard to answer .
I know you like me .
Tom is playing with his cat .
I hope you &apos;re not mad at me .
Are you as tired as I am ?
What did Tom know ?
Tom and I &apos;ll go with Mary .
Let us know by next Monday .
We &apos;ll come with you .
Tom saw him .
You must not stay here .
Those two don &apos;t get along .
What makes you think I like you ?
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
Help yourself to a piece of cake .
She &apos;ll love her husband forever .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
Is that what people do ?
Tom still has feelings for Mary .
You don &apos;t like Tom , do you ?
Promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
My father has been dead for ten years .
I don &apos;t believe a word Tom says .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s good .
Tom loves Mary .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
I &apos;m dining out this evening .
Take a seat , please .
She is old enough to know better .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
We &apos;re in danger .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary likes John .
We didn &apos;t do it for Tom .
Tom made fun of the teacher .
I want one like that .
Tom called me and asked me to come to Boston .
Tom is surprised .
He hit me on the head .
I have a boyfriend back home .
Is Tom that good ?
It was white .
Why am I so tired ?
Did you see Tom leave ?
He can hardly speak .
Tom realized Mary was right .
How is your family ?
These are for Tom .
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Can you see Tom ?
You &apos;re not supposed to be here .
Tom never called .
She took my hand .
Which do you like better , summer or winter ?
Why is Tom so good at French ?
We aren &apos;t married .
What time do you finish work ?
Who &apos;s watching ?
This house is too small to live in .
I arrived later than usual .
You often need to spend more time doing something than you anticipated .
I think it &apos;s time for me to do my homework .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be married to Tom .
Why are you here ?
When was the last time you saw your children ?
I had something else in mind .
I bought this camera yesterday .
It &apos;s no problem .
Tom could hardly wait to tell Mary .
Have you heard whether Tom got the job ?
It was yesterday that I met her .
Can you believe that ?
Tom looked at Mary sideways .
Tom could go to jail for this .
Do you want to know where you made your mistake ?
He asked for my advice .
She didn &apos;t buy bread .
I have something else for you .
I really wish to see you today .
Lunch will be ready soon .
Tom won &apos;t succeed .
Tom has left .
You &apos;re wounded .
Did Tom speak French to you ?
We &apos;re going to Boston to see Tom .
Mother always gets up early in the morning .
You may take my word for it .
He doesn &apos;t always come late .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
He isn &apos;t coming , either .
How could we have been so stupid ?
I can carry that for you .
How old do you think Tom is ?
I like both cats and dogs .
I &apos;ve already written to Tom .
I hope that you will like it .
Tell Tom what this is .
My father takes a walk every morning .
I was in the hospital last week .
Please wait for thirty minutes .
I don &apos;t care how expensive it is .
I spoke in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone .
That &apos;s what we have to do .
There &apos;s no telling how long it &apos;ll take us to find Tom .
I don &apos;t have anything to say to Tom .
Tom is the one .
I &apos;ll be back at 6 : 30 .
Tom knows what he has to do .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
I want what you want .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m happy here .
Tom looks fine to me .
Tom was busy , so he couldn &apos;t help us .
I &apos;ll get in touch with Tom by telephone tomorrow and ask him to give us a hand .
There is a right time for everything .
Tom is always reading .
I want to spend more time with my family .
Get your hands off me .
What do you think you &apos;d do ?
Is your uncle still abroad ?
Someone stole Tom &apos;s money .
Tom loves music .
Don &apos;t worry .
No one was to be seen on the street .
I want to be as rich as Tom .
You lost .
We want to talk to you about a problem .
I want to play .
Why &apos;s Tom so good at French ?
You have to help .
You have to stop this .
You need to do exactly what I tell you .
Tom broke his promise and didn &apos;t help Mary .
I think you have a problem , Tom .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
I assume you know who Tom is .
I &apos;ve never been there myself .
Why did you start studying French ?
Could you explain it to me again ?
Why should I be afraid of Tom ?
I believe Tom knows .
&quot; Where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; How would I know ? &quot;
I might have left it on the table .
It &apos;s a good question .
Tom is very rich , isn &apos;t he ?
How much money do you have on you ?
I &apos;d like to see her .
Tom wanted that .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to say .
This has to be the truth .
I don &apos;t wanna hear a word from you .
I loved it in Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t my friend .
Tom no longer lives here .
Mary spent all her time working .
We don &apos;t want you here .
Why does that require an apology ?
Were both Tom and Mary born in Australia ?
I am very glad to see you .
I received a letter from my brother .
Tell everybody .
I &apos;m here to help .
That &apos;s very , very good .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem now .
My eyes are sore .
Tom is too stupid to be scared .
I &apos;m too busy to go .
Tom didn &apos;t need it anymore .
She was very busy .
I &apos;ll deal with this problem .
He took off his clothes .
Why do you want to know ?
I wonder if he loves me .
English is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom wondered what Mary would say to John .
It seems rather expensive to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary doing that .
Tom also saw it .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
He has to come .
Can Tom see us ?
It won &apos;t be that hard .
I &apos;m going to learn French .
Tom looked at his dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to go .
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
Where is the bus ?
Why are you coming to Boston ?
Tom has to do that tomorrow .
You know I &apos;m telling the truth .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
Tom went to Boston a month ago .
We have one for you , too .
When did you ask Tom ?
Tom wanted to talk to you .
I have three computers .
I hope we &apos;ll be seeing you around here soon .
You need to stop saying that .
Things would never be the same .
She saw him eating a sandwich .
You &apos;re with me , aren &apos;t you ?
This is where it began .
Tom seemed very surprised when I told him about it .
Tell Tom to come to Boston .
My father is very angry with me .
I think I &apos;m OK .
I am going to take two days off next week .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom asked me if I was hungry .
I want something to eat .
That is all right .
My watch has been stolen .
You should stay at home today .
Tom sat down next to Mary on the couch .
Tom called me today .
Give me my money .
I didn &apos;t expect that question .
What type of music do you like ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to leave for school .
Why did you do that ?
Tom plans to go by himself .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I like my job very much .
Tom is on vacation .
Do you know how to get to our place ?
Tom is good at singing .
Maybe you don &apos;t want to remember .
Tom couldn &apos;t stop .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Tom told me that he &apos;s cold .
We remember .
I think Tom wants our help .
You &apos;re not my brother .
I must visit my friend in the hospital .
I &apos;ve finished all the work for today .
We came to Boston yesterday .
Get it ready at once .
Step aside .
You don &apos;t look that good .
It was very small .
He looks like his mother .
He never saw his sister again .
Tom wants to come .
Is that so bad ?
There are seven days in a week .
It &apos;s not my problem .
Nobody wants Tom .
Your parents must &apos;ve been worried .
I still don &apos;t believe it !
We &apos;re doing it the right way .
May I use that ?
I need to know how this happened .
Let &apos;s eat our food before it gets cold .
Tom believes that .
Tom saw Mary coming .
Are you almost ready ?
Tom is feeling a little bit better today .
I do not like both of them .
I can &apos;t leave now .
We have only two dollars .
Tom is not happy to be here .
I mean what I say .
What is Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name ?
I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
There &apos;s more .
Tom was so busy .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
I want you to come .
Admit it , Tom , you &apos;re still in love with me .
Tom has known Mary for a long time .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was from Boston .
This seems too good to be true .
You won &apos;t give that to Tom , will you ?
What do you want to have for lunch ?
What did Tom do ?
Can you help us ?
She was too tired to speak .
Nobody wants you to do that .
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
I really hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about me .
I want my money .
What &apos;ll you be doing ?
Tom knew what Mary knew .
I &apos;m not being paid enough .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
It may not come to that .
I deserve another chance .
The meeting was almost over .
Tom showed us a picture of Mary .
They found Tom .
It &apos;s now time to leave .
I can &apos;t remember how I got home last night .
I wish I had a brother .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s decision .
I &apos;m thinking about you .
You know why I left .
I &apos;m not a mind reader . You need to tell me what you want .
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
His story can &apos;t be true .
Have you heard Tom &apos;s music ?
Let &apos;s try it .
It &apos;s likely Tom will know what to do .
What kind of place is this ?
We love her , and she loves us , too .
Money doesn &apos;t always bring happiness .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have enough time .
What are your plans for today ?
Someone has to tell Tom .
Live and learn .
The bed in Tom &apos;s room was unmade .
Are you the boss ?
The bus went by without stopping .
What was Tom wearing ?
Your father is pretty tall .
I watched the movie .
Why is Tom so busy ?
Thanks for asking .
You have nothing to worry about .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I don &apos;t need any help .
I have some money with me .
Did my father really die ?
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll like it .
I tell you the truth .
I want to live here .
People believe what they want to believe .
Tom has done it before .
I don &apos;t think Tom lives here .
Tom said he just needed more time .
Nobody can know everything .
You &apos;re doing really great .
What are you going to do with it ?
It &apos;s a matter of life and death .
Tom knew that .
Tom has no idea what has become of Mary .
He doesn &apos;t know much about Japan .
Tom said that he bought an old car .
The water was cold .
We want to help Tom .
Didn &apos;t you read the book ?
She hardly ate anything .
Tom read it for me .
The only one I saw in the park was Tom .
I thought it wasn &apos;t supposed to rain today .
I came here to give you a gift .
Tom gave me a book .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
No one loves war .
You aren &apos;t thinking .
I don &apos;t deserve to live .
You &apos;d better not do it .
They found each other .
You should eat .
Tom hasn &apos;t bought milk yet .
I know Tom &apos;s brother .
You may use my car .
My life is in danger .
We don &apos;t know .
He walked past the house .
I &apos;m finished .
I made Tom go home .
We really have to go .
I was hardly able to see it .
I checked into a hotel and went right to sleep .
We all agree with you .
You are as tall as I am .
Tom spent his birthday in the hospital .
Tom is driving me mad .
How did you make it ?
I want to know who used to live here .
I haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
I called him up yesterday .
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary .
In the summer , eggs go bad quickly .
Tom will call you later .
I understand why .
Tom likes to do almost everything by himself .
I can &apos;t imagine doing that .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
How do you know how hard it is ?
You are one of us .
Is that your new book ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
This is a dog .
I don &apos;t know because I wasn &apos;t there .
Mary is going to have a baby next month .
We have nothing else to eat .
Don &apos;t make fun of children .
I can &apos;t see Tom .
Cut that out !
You must have made a mistake .
I think you should tell Tom .
It &apos;s the voice of an old woman .
Tom was in Boston three weeks ago .
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
Are you really awake ?
It is me that is wrong .
Exactly what was supposed to happen ?
They know that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go .
Do you want to buy a shirt ?
Tom and I love each other .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
Do you want Tom ?
Let Tom do anything he wants .
Tom had to stay in bed .
I found it easy to speak English .
You gave it to me .
What do you want to eat this weekend ?
Thanks to both of you .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind helping Mary occasionally .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his son to turn out like me .
Tom is angry with me .
Did Tom eat dinner ?
Can I go to bed now ?
He didn &apos;t listen to music .
Could we talk about last night ?
Tom takes the bus to the city .
He asked me to wait there until he came back .
What do we want here ?
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
How was your afternoon ?
Tom knew perfectly well what he was doing .
What made you think Tom hasn &apos;t done that ?
What time did you arrive there ?
I hate everyone .
I was invited to lunch .
Do you know why he has been absent from school ?
Tom couldn &apos;t find it .
Where is your father ?
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom looked at me like I was crazy .
Everybody knows us .
Tom speaks French as well as English .
Where do you really live ?
How did Tom get hurt ?
I &apos;ll be back after lunch .
They want to help .
I was in London last month .
Can your brother drive a car ?
Tom died three years ago .
Leave it there .
I had no idea what to say .
When shall we meet again ?
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make another mistake .
It is likely to rain tomorrow .
Tom is outside .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
The apple fell from the tree .
I &apos;ve just come to Boston .
He looks stern .
What do you men want ?
Give Tom what he wants .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to like this .
I can barely sleep at all anymore .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
I have poor eyesight .
He looks like a horse .
She likes sleeping .
Tom couldn &apos;t stand being alone with Mary .
Did Tom come here yesterday ?
I got my son to repair the door .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him before .
How do you know what I &apos;m thinking ?
I can &apos;t believe you actually said that .
You have little to gain and much to lose .
He is very young .
Tom isn &apos;t as good at French as you think he is .
Tom drives me crazy .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even discuss it .
I can take the bus .
How can you tell Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
I can &apos;t eat all that by myself .
Tom was looking for you this morning .
I &apos;m not alone .
How much can we take ?
You still have a lot to learn .
I know he is busy .
I want the money .
How are things between you two now ?
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
I &apos;d like a word with you .
Are these your things ?
This is all still new to me .
Did you telephone him ?
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
You can &apos;t have the job .
I &apos;m not going to school today .
Tom asked if what Mary said was true .
Do you know how to do this ?
I think Tom was looking for you .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re pleased .
What will you have for lunch today ?
I like bread .
I think you &apos;ll find it .
Please turn off the television .
I was a little surprised .
I want to know how .
Why don &apos;t you go with Tom ?
I can &apos;t remember who I am .
I thought that was your job .
An idea came to me .
Nobody can help you .
Are you in on this ?
That won &apos;t happen .
I chopped a tree down .
That &apos;s what people don &apos;t understand .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
This is the house in which he was born .
Tom , what do you think ?
Whatever happens happens .
Tom got rich quickly .
I like to write in French .
Tom always had to do everything himself .
Is this hat yours ?
Tom is going to drive you to the airport .
It &apos;s dangerous out there .
Let &apos;s meet Tom .
Don &apos;t lose heart .
You should have one of us do it .
I can &apos;t live with you anymore .
Tom should have married Mary .
Tom helps anyone that asks him for help .
Here we are again .
I &apos;d like for you to go .
How long were you there ?
He still writes to me from time to time .
Tom knows that I don &apos;t like him .
You &apos;ll never know the truth .
The whole world speaks English .
Do you know anything about his family ?
All you can do is wait .
How far is it from here to your house ?
He will walk .
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
Tom speaks French well , but not as well as he speaks English .
Tom is very good at French .
I want to talk to you about Tom .
The stakes are high .
Who will look after the baby ?
Tom &apos;s father is rich .
Tom isn &apos;t back yet .
I know you don &apos;t remember me .
Five years have gone by since my father died .
The boss has a good opinion of your work .
How small is it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
He &apos;s two years older than I am .
There isn &apos;t anyone in the room .
I want you to come to Boston .
Are you sure you didn &apos;t do anything ?
He rarely goes to the movies .
How &apos;s it going with your family ?
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know the answer .
He &apos;s giving it a go .
Do you think we &apos;ll have good weather tomorrow ?
Tom has won the prize .
Tom has gone home .
Who stayed ?
Do you have a daughter ?
Why does Tom want to do that ?
Tom stuck around .
Prepare yourself .
Is there any room for me ?
We live close to the station .
Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to .
I wonder what I &apos;ll find in the box .
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re really in love with me .
I wouldn &apos;t have done that any differently .
I can &apos;t drink milk .
What will we eat ?
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
I &apos;m not happy here .
I already told Tom that .
It &apos;s what Tom wanted .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to finish this .
What we need is a little more time .
You should ask Tom yourself .
Tom lives across the street .
Don &apos;t come into my room .
Let Tom eat whatever he wants .
I &apos;m the one who made that decision .
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe it .
I wanted Tom to learn French .
Does Tom have a big family ?
What is it that Tom wants ?
He can &apos;t answer their questions .
Do you have a large family ?
We do almost everything together .
Tom doesn &apos;t come here anymore .
I know what you &apos;re probably thinking .
Did you really steal this food ?
He fell off the horse .
He started the day with a good breakfast .
We have no need for assistance .
Tom said that he &apos;d help me .
You should &apos;ve phoned .
I don &apos;t like my job .
I &apos;ve heard this story before .
Mary looks just like her mother .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
I &apos;ve found a job .
I didn &apos;t know whether to stay here or go to London .
How much do you like Tom ?
I see the boy .
Do whatever makes you happy .
Tom &apos;ll wait .
Tom is behind you .
Why don &apos;t you understand ?
He walks in the park every morning .
I &apos;ve read this book before .
What else do you have ?
He &apos;s in danger .
Tom died at the hospital .
Why are you back from lunch so soon ?
That &apos;s one way of putting it .
I &apos;m quite busy .
How many people came to your party ?
I don &apos;t care what people say .
I saw what I saw .
You were there for Tom when he needed you .
That isn &apos;t Tom .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did it .
Tom gave Mary his phone number .
Tom has nothing to do .
Tom thinks he knows where Mary lives .
Who told you I was talking about you ?
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow .
Tom is probably a bit older than Mary .
Tom says I look like you .
Did you make it ?
You can &apos;t marry Tom .
It &apos;s very hot here .
Why didn &apos;t you come to the party ?
I thought I could help Tom , but I couldn &apos;t .
I thought I could do it .
He told me to meet him at 1 o &apos;clock at the airport .
Tom seems nervous .
There are many books in my room .
What will your wife think ?
Here I am .
Did you use to live here ?
Tom likes it hot .
Tom removed his glasses .
She gives too much money to her son .
Tom wants to show you something .
They won &apos;t help you .
I think I understood everything Tom said , but I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
I think so , too .
I may have to study French .
Tom belongs here .
We &apos;ve known Tom for years .
Tom wanted to get married .
Who &apos;s paying for the food ?
That door won &apos;t open .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes Mary .
My grandfather loves to read .
I ate with my parents .
He had to work even on Sunday .
He quit smoking .
Tom could help you .
Tom often writes to his parents .
I &apos;ll never forget this .
We were both a bit drunk .
She gave him a book .
Why is it here ?
I always feel hungry .
Tom didn &apos;t study French yesterday .
Tom could &apos;ve been the one .
What was Tom like ?
You &apos;ve got my vote .
It looks like Tom is disappointed .
She is going to learn how to drive .
Tom said that he thought that he should learn how to do that .
I know where the key is .
The problem was so difficult that I could not solve it .
You can &apos;t just leave .
How old is your dog ?
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t want to hurt you . I want to help you .
May I see your passport ?
Tom came to my office yesterday .
I wish she would stop smoking .
What got into you ?
I wonder why Tom wants that .
Just do it .
Are you one of Tom &apos;s children ?
We could go there now .
Is this your glass or your sister &apos;s ?
How often do you see her ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom is here .
Is there anything Tom can &apos;t do ?
Where &apos;s your suitcase ?
I think you &apos;d know the reason for that better than I do .
We don &apos;t know her .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you do that .
Let &apos;s wait here .
Tom just barely earns enough to live on .
I know things you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll be 30 this October .
I &apos;m getting old .
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
He seems disappointed in his son .
He seemed to like that .
I &apos;ve found Tom .
I ran to my mother .
You must study more .
They may not be home .
Tom knows what that is .
Tom left for work earlier than usual .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
Why do you think Tom would do this ?
&quot; Where are the books ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re on the desk . &quot;
Do you still believe Tom ?
You don &apos;t want to do that .
They say he &apos;s very rich .
He is almost six feet tall .
Let Tom do it .
She took the trouble to find a home for them .
Tom is in his late thirties .
Give it to me , please .
Have you eaten yet ?
Is all this money yours ?
Tom never falls .
I &apos;m here with Tom .
Did you play tennis ?
Where &apos;s the money ?
Tom has an opinion on everything .
She can &apos;t drive a car .
Tom has to give Mary something .
You should go home . It &apos;s late and you &apos;re drunk .
They don &apos;t need me anymore .
They know you .
I am afraid I must be going now .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thinks .
You &apos;re in no danger .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
Tom has been here for three years .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
I could have bought that for you .
I just want a little more coffee .
Tom sometimes helps his mother in the kitchen .
Tom has decided not to go to the meeting .
Tom wants to have a talk with Mary .
Tom ate his dinner .
We expect a lot from him .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
I didn &apos;t meet anyone .
This one &apos;s for me .
Please advise me on what to do .
Tom said that he loves me and wants to marry me .
You don &apos;t want to make Tom mad , do you ?
He spoke very well .
That &apos;s all I have to say .
Nobody wants you to do that .
I can &apos;t think of any place I &apos;d rather be .
Has Tom gone , too ?
I &apos;d like some more water .
Is there a desk by the window ?
They came here one after another .
It &apos;s your fault , not mine .
May I show you something ?
He &apos;s getting old .
What do you want to eat for lunch ?
Everyone loves that place .
Everybody &apos;s doing something .
What if Tom was right ?
I &apos;d rather take a taxi than walk .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this one bit .
I know that Tom is nice .
I &apos;m at the library .
He has to make a speech at the party .
I didn &apos;t want to let Tom into my house .
You &apos;re going to love living here .
Do you want Tom to go to Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt anyone .
Let &apos;s definitely do that .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
Tom was angry with himself .
Tom was also on the bus .
I &apos;d also like to have a try .
What do you have here ?
He came home exactly at ten .
Do you want him ?
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
Tom is worried about the boys .
That doesn &apos;t really help us , does it ?
Tom looked young .
I know you know .
Tom called a cab for Mary .
I &apos;m not done with you .
I always go to school on foot .
You must take care of the dog .
She asked how his father was .
There is a time for everything .
You aren &apos;t happy , are you ?
I don &apos;t think she is happy .
Tom wants to marry Mary .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
I need an answer now .
Tom has never fallen in love .
We shouldn &apos;t have told Tom .
Where are my books ?
Why are you being so nice to me ?
I like my life .
I wanted to introduce you to Tom .
I have a message .
I knew it was wrong .
Let me see that .
He came again after a week .
I &apos;ve only done this once before .
Without you , I am nothing .
She spoke as though nothing had happened .
There it is !
We &apos;re happy to be here .
Tom is waiting outside .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
You will soon cease to think of her .
Tom will have an answer for you by next week .
We want one .
I &apos;m not sure he wants to talk to me .
You know how they are .
Did Tom say why Mary went to Boston ?
I understand it more or less .
Do you expect me to believe that ?
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
I met him on my way home .
You &apos;re worrying too much .
I don &apos;t want to study .
We &apos;re back early .
Tom won &apos;t like you .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too happy .
How are Tom and Mary ?
Tom is too young to be doing that .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
This task is difficult .
We &apos;ve got no choice .
Tom was here today asking for help .
She looked around her room .
He never asked me .
He doesn &apos;t have any children .
Tom thinks Mary is at home .
Who &apos;s not busy ?
She called for help .
We came out ahead .
That &apos;ll change nothing .
He can &apos;t do it .
Is it too small ?
Did you study French yesterday ?
Tom always talks fast .
Who &apos;d believe you anyway ?
Maybe we ought to ask Tom for advice .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
Tom waited for Mary for a long time .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Your time &apos;s up .
I knew Tom wasn &apos;t going to change .
Please keep on working even when I &apos;m not here .
I know them all .
I &apos;ll do what I have to do .
It &apos;s best not to ask .
Did you see him at the station this morning ?
We don &apos;t have to worry about Tom .
Tom seemed very surprised .
You must go at once .
What do you want to give Tom ?
I &apos;m interested in doing that , but Tom isn &apos;t .
Let &apos;s finish the job .
I heard you say that this morning .
I read your letter yesterday .
Tom knows what it takes .
Is somebody there ?
When did you begin learning French ?
I &apos;ve never heard him speak ill of others .
Tom acted like nothing had happened .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is staying .
Tom is interested by many things .
I can &apos;t see it .
The taxi I took was very old and small .
I &apos;ll be around all day .
Is this a river ?
Tom isn &apos;t alone .
I &apos;ll be in bed by the time you get home .
Tom learned a new word .
Yesterday he came back late .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me to do that .
Do you want to live in Boston ?
I think Tom should do it .
No matter what he does , he does it well .
I &apos;m not sure whether Tom heard it or not .
How do I do that ?
That &apos;s not how I see it .
I &apos;m in Boston for a whole week .
We need a doctor .
She still loves him .
That won &apos;t happen .
Tom likes going for walks .
That is the duty of the police .
Hands off .
Tom should &apos;ve won .
Maybe it can be fixed .
I wasn &apos;t too surprised .
I bought a book about animals .
You should stay in bed .
Your room is bigger than mine .
How long will you be staying with us ?
Did Tom work for you ?
I want one like that .
Let &apos;s sing a song .
We couldn &apos;t stop .
What do you think has become of him ?
I will not let you do it .
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m in Australia .
Can you help me find a job ?
I ate an apple before I went for a walk .
I think Tom should see this .
He is wearing glasses .
This is the man who they say stole the car .
It &apos;s still Monday .
Maybe that won &apos;t happen .
That &apos;s not yours .
What books have you read in French ?
Tom listened to Mary &apos;s story .
She is now on vacation .
We have to get him to the hospital before it &apos;s too late .
Why did you do that ?
I take back what I said .
He is eight .
I should &apos;ve done that .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
I don &apos;t know this road .
I think I &apos;m in love .
Tom knows this .
We just want you to be happy .
Tom pretended not to understand French .
Tom is his usual self today .
I believe Tom can win .
I was told you were reliable .
She was waiting in front of the building .
This answer makes me angry .
Tom got into the car and drove away .
She put the children to bed .
Even if it rains tomorrow , I &apos;ll go there .
Can you explain your answer ?
Tom , I need your help .
I &apos;m very glad that I did it .
Is that a question ?
Tom got married three years ago .
I &apos;d like to become a doctor .
None of us will help you .
What is he doing ?
She is very careful , so she seldom makes mistakes .
Did you like Boston ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to his wife .
I know who you are .
Just give me the phone .
Tom didn &apos;t think that what Mary said was true .
I was there .
Tom and Mary want John to stay for a few more hours .
How old are the kids ?
What did you just say ?
I &apos;d rather not answer that question .
How long do we have ?
Do you know where Tom is ?
What do you want ?
We should read as many books as possible .
It doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s going to rain .
It &apos;s very nice of you .
How can I solve this problem ?
He gets around a lot .
Do you know how to fix this ?
Tom and Mary are still watching TV .
They aren &apos;t rich .
This book is so difficult that I can &apos;t read it .
I think Tom went to Boston by car .
It &apos;s still not working .
I &apos;m a friend .
I know the way .
They &apos;re using you .
The bus will take time .
I think you &apos;re drinking out of my glass .
You may as well wait here .
I &apos;ll show you around town .
We are men .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer his question .
I &apos;m glad you invited me .
Tom never visits Mary anymore .
I believe you can help us .
He ran out of the room in anger .
Tom said he had been busy .
I don &apos;t want to talk .
Why do we have to help Tom ?
Tom is walking .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
This car handles very easily .
I study French , too .
I didn &apos;t know what I should say to Tom .
Tom wanted a new car .
Tom is terrified .
Tom said he thinks you &apos;re stupid .
You &apos;ll find out soon enough .
She visits us every other day .
Her hands are small , but not so small that she can &apos;t play the piano .
I have a very good opinion of Tom .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
The new car is hers .
I didn &apos;t stay there very long .
This was all Tom &apos;s idea .
Tom will go as well .
I &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t go there by yourself .
I left earlier than my sister .
He must be very happy .
I just don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible .
Why aren &apos;t you in Boston ?
She is likely to come .
He lives in a large house .
I usually go home at four .
I guess that you can &apos;t do it .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom .
You &apos;re not listening .
They &apos;re doing great .
His mother was right .
I &apos;m not proud of what I did .
I didn &apos;t know you were going to be here today .
What do you know about Australia ?
Tom is Mary &apos;s grandfather .
I found your keys .
Where &apos;s Tom playing ?
Eating fish is good for your health .
We want to see Tom do that .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be careful .
I made Tom do that .
Tom asked me to leave the room .
They move from place to place .
That has nothing to do with you .
No one was watching .
I couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
Tom sometimes goes to work by bus .
We were too late .
I &apos;d like to know more about Tom .
That &apos;s unimportant .
Tom won &apos;t likely feel like doing that .
When are you going out ?
I don &apos;t see how .
I really am sorry .
Tom needed that .
We know each other quite well .
Why did she do that ?
I &apos;m not going to make the same mistake again .
He told me that the book was interesting .
You &apos;ll have to work a lot .
They deserved it .
I &apos;m not entirely sure .
Is Tom dead yet ?
I speak French with Tom and Mary .
We won &apos;t lose .
I spoke with him about the matter .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
Mary can dance well .
You can go anywhere you want .
I don &apos;t see why .
You must be Tom .
I already knew this .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
The television doesn &apos;t work .
How long have you known him ?
It &apos;s been raining for about a week .
This table doesn &apos;t fit well here .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
You have no one to blame but yourself .
When are you off ?
Tom didn &apos;t look that happy .
Give me my money back .
Where &apos;s my husband ?
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she didn &apos;t want to .
What happened out there ?
Have you made plans for next weekend ?
Tom , Mary and their children went to Boston last weekend .
Tom is waiting for you .
Don &apos;t you want to go to the party ?
Tom was important to me .
What you are saying does not make sense .
I &apos;m free today .
I want a dog .
He gave in .
Tom is often absent .
I want to go to another country .
You haven &apos;t tried hard enough .
He has been like a father to me .
Tom is good-looking .
What would you like to eat ?
Does that answer satisfy you ?
Tom has a couple of friends in Australia .
I have to open my shop .
Please make sure that you get home by 2 : 30 .
I helped Tom .
I know now what I have to do .
All you have to do is give him a little help .
Everybody had a hard time .
Where is your school ?
Tom wasn &apos;t there either .
I don &apos;t know if he knows it .
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened ?
Is that snow ?
You have to give me more time .
I need a place I can study .
I really wish I could play tennis with you tomorrow .
You &apos;re the one I like .
Thanks for the help .
Tom told the police what happened .
What do you guys want to do ?
Where is my watch ?
I get the point .
Tom said that he was really sleepy and wanted to go to bed .
Tom didn &apos;t have time to read the report .
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
Have you made up your mind yet ?
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary in years .
I know what her name is .
You can &apos;t imagine how happy she was .
Please have a drink .
Tom always takes his time in everything he does .
Tom brought flowers .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
I &apos;m eating .
What don &apos;t you like about your job ?
Don &apos;t mention that to Tom .
Tom said Mary was a good swimmer .
It was very cold , but we went out .
No one knows that I like you .
They &apos;re in love .
What &apos;s the best way to approach a guy ?
Eggs go bad quickly in the summer .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy .
This is a fun activity for children .
None of us plan to do that .
You &apos;ll have to look out for Tom .
That &apos;ll never change .
I can &apos;t look at this anymore .
My dad just called .
You &apos;re not thinking .
I wish she had come last night .
You &apos;re strong .
You should not speak ill of others .
It &apos;s totally wrong .
Father will be back in a few days .
It &apos;s all very simple .
Tom has been watching TV all day .
I prefer to travel in my car .
You &apos;d better not go there .
I hate you all .
It was very cold .
I was barely able to work .
Tom seemed perfectly happy .
Don &apos;t worry about things that aren &apos;t important .
I can &apos;t explain everything .
Tom felt foolish .
Tom was born rich .
How many hours are left ?
Tom wants a new bicycle .
He did nothing but read newspapers .
I &apos;m afraid of dying .
I like your garden and the flowers in it .
We &apos;re not home .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
He didn &apos;t believe it at first .
This gift is for you .
We &apos;re nearly finished .
I &apos;m in school .
What do you want me to do there ?
Tom felt hungry .
He wrote a letter .
I can &apos;t find Tom either .
She looked as if she had been sick for a long time .
I will not go to school tomorrow .
Tom asked Mary some questions .
You ought to know that .
What do you want me to do about it ?
He often sits by me and listens to music .
I &apos;ll find something .
Tom loves doing this .
Tom had trouble understanding what Mary was saying .
We &apos;ll go together .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat out as often as they used to .
Did Tom hurt you ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know anyone in Boston .
You can go home now if you like .
Please read that book .
Tom spoke to Mary for the first time yesterday .
I want to make you happy .
Tom is still waiting for you .
I wish I could give up smoking .
I have no time to go to America .
I wish that you wouldn &apos;t do that .
I know about Tom and Mary .
Where do you really live ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
You have to let me help you .
Tom isn &apos;t outside .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
I want you to see her .
You did not come to school yesterday .
We have to get back before Tom does .
I have everything I need .
We &apos;ll have to do something .
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
It &apos;s just that simple .
Tom would never do something like that .
Do you know what time they came ?
Mary sings best of all of the girls in class .
What do you have to lose ?
Tom never discusses that .
What did you have for breakfast ?
It was a last minute decision .
Tom told us about his trip .
Tom is likely to forget his promise .
Today , we are going dancing .
I can &apos;t sing .
What I did was wrong .
Have it your own way .
When did you first meet Tom ?
I will find you a good doctor .
You wouldn &apos;t have to say anything .
Tom wanted to know why Mary couldn &apos;t go .
Our cat is in the kitchen .
Tom and Mary looked at each other .
Tom worked here .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
I need you to do it yourself .
You liked that movie , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom kept me waiting for a long time .
I &apos;m very disappointed .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t well .
I gave him a book .
What I want to know is why .
You don &apos;t look all that happy .
How long &apos;s Tom been sick ?
Give me a reason .
I took a taxi from the station to the hotel .
Tom abandoned his wife and children .
I don &apos;t like Tom either .
It was nice meeting you here .
Tom wants to go there again .
I bought this yesterday .
I wish Tom was here .
I am very glad to meet you .
Tom was in trouble .
I worked at it .
I see you &apos;re all awake .
I &apos;ll come with you .
That will not change .
I will give him the book tomorrow .
Why can &apos;t we do it again ?
It &apos;s already time to go to sleep .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I know Tom loves living here .
Do you remember what you were watching ?
Tom forgot to do his homework .
I am having a look at it .
I saw him with my own eyes .
You should &apos;ve said so earlier .
You &apos;re so good at singing .
They left before the end of the movie .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
I &apos;ll do anything .
We study French together .
You don &apos;t need to go there .
I &apos;m good at what I do .
How is your family ?
Tom was on television last night .
I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
Tom showed me how to do it .
How many cats do you guys have ?
My father is an early riser .
I thought that Tom was in Boston .
It is impossible for me to help you .
Tom loves me .
That &apos;s my plan .
We went to the beach to swim .
Did you do your homework ?
I must go alone .
I love her so much I could die .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
Mary is beautiful .
Maybe I don &apos;t want to know .
Tom is opening the window .
I &apos;ll go and ask Tom .
I didn &apos;t think it &apos;d happen this quickly .
It &apos;s not a big thing .
I love you just as you are .
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom was right at home .
My foot &apos;s asleep again !
I think Tom did well .
Now that &apos;s a name I haven ’ t heard in a long time .
When I returned home , my brother was doing his homework .
I didn &apos;t even ask .
I &apos;m not as lucky as you .
I will help you all I can .
Give me that one .
We &apos;d better hurry back .
I have a lot of work to clear up by the weekend .
I have to find Tom .
My brother is very tall .
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
Why are you pretending you don &apos;t remember ?
Have you seen that movie ?
Tom wanted to wait for the next bus .
Somebody has to be here for Tom .
How can that be ?
That &apos;s not my fault .
I asked Tom and Mary why they &apos;d never gotten married .
I don &apos;t mind doing it .
Isn &apos;t there anyone else who can help you ?
We &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
I didn &apos;t see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t think you &apos;ll win .
He told me everything .
How long have you been married to Tom ?
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
Do you have many friends ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to work late .
The telephone doesn &apos;t work .
I think Tom has to go to Boston .
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
I want you .
Tom doesn &apos;t read books .
He introduced his sister to me .
I just want to get some sleep .
Tom almost never makes a mistake .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t have any children .
It &apos;s unlikely to be true .
Tom won &apos;t like this .
Tom asked me to open the door .
Tom knows the situation better than I do .
I have to go to work .
I think I just saw something .
You &apos;re after me .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
I &apos;ll talk .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
Tom had no money with him at that time .
I thought Tom would be in his room .
What kind of ship is that ?
He found my bike .
How do you like your new house ?
Tom wants us to leave .
I wonder why women outlive men .
They were sure he would always fail .
Tom was injured in the accident .
Tom is my sister &apos;s boy .
Tom couldn &apos;t find Mary .
You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
That doesn &apos;t change anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here .
They &apos;re taking too long .
Tom is sure .
I think Tom is sick .
That &apos;s very simple .
I would like to know her name .
Tom says you should always tell the truth .
I know what you were doing .
I don &apos;t think Tom has very long to live .
Tom will never be able to do that .
We don &apos;t have long .
She came to see us yesterday .
I was at a loss for an answer .
Tom can &apos;t wait until next week .
What would the world do without tea ?
Tom fell asleep on the couch .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is .
I have work to do .
They know your name .
Did Tom go home ?
I &apos;ll make you breakfast .
Where will your friends sleep ?
She must be sick .
She likes the teacher .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is mad at me .
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom says he &apos;ll give it a try .
There is your bag .
This car is mine .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants .
Tom probably knows more than he &apos;s telling us .
I &apos;m going downtown .
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston .
Don &apos;t keep saying you &apos;re sorry .
How hungry are you , Tom ?
He called a cab for me .
I should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I was having dinner with Tom .
There &apos;s a lot of traffic .
I set my watch ahead one hour .
Where do I find that ?
You &apos;ll lose everything .
What do you have ?
This isn &apos;t my car .
Ignorance is bliss .
I can still remember that day .
I need some water .
I haven &apos;t eaten yet .
How old is your sister ?
Today is a good day to die .
That will put you in danger .
Tom , Mary and John are in the kitchen .
What don &apos;t you have ?
I thought he had died .
My mother is busy in the kitchen .
Tom worries too much .
I found the money that Tom had lost .
I &apos;m really tired and want to go to bed early .
I don &apos;t know if I still have it .
I don &apos;t want her .
We should have gotten married .
I saw some flowers on the table .
Everyone knows you &apos;re in love with Tom .
I don &apos;t have a cat , but Tom does .
Do you have a boyfriend ?
I can &apos;t eat the apple .
I have to tell Tom .
Do you want me to leave ?
I know how Tom thinks .
Can I talk to you ?
His car is two years old .
I don &apos;t plan to see Tom till tomorrow .
Where &apos;s your car , Tom ?
He didn &apos;t study at all .
We &apos;re not doing this again .
I wish we had more time .
I don &apos;t have many friends .
Can you do that here ?
Tom didn &apos;t even look at the report that Mary gave him .
I managed to get to the station on time .
You can stay here as long as you want .
Tom thinks Mary is here .
What are you here for ?
You &apos;ll love Australia .
I took it .
She found him a seat .
I can &apos;t be without you .
I will give it to you .
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
I saw her last week .
I worry about the kids .
Tom has a big dog .
Where did you eat ?
I can &apos;t cook at all .
I got off the train .
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
I haven &apos;t spoken to Tom .
I didn &apos;t have to pay .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Father bought me the book .
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
What is it now , Tom ?
The water began to boil .
Why haven &apos;t you called ?
This is something Tom made for you .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
I think I will take a vacation this week .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
Tom said that yesterday .
Tom seldom gets angry .
Everyone is singing .
I would &apos;ve liked that .
Where are we going to meet ?
I want to stay here with you .
Which is more valuable , time or money ?
That &apos;s really not funny .
You &apos;re nervous .
Tom and Mary did their homework together .
Is she married ?
Is that why you did this ?
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t together anymore .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told that story to my mother .
People should love each other .
He let us go .
Did Tom find you ?
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
The children are gone .
You &apos;d love Tom .
I have to look after this cat .
Can you help me ?
There was a lot of food in the house .
I should &apos;ve known better .
That &apos;s exactly what I want to hear .
Tom can do better than that , I think .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t really like Mary very much .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat much .
Are you alive ?
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think he did .
I &apos;d like to stay a little bit longer .
My dogs are white .
I told him about our school .
I didn &apos;t let them know .
We can do it right now .
I should go now .
I have lost my watch .
Let the boy go .
I think Tom likes it .
I &apos;m happy doing what I do .
Don &apos;t give me anything .
I eat everything .
I went out for a beer with my friends .
Tom has to do that , too .
She is interested in music .
Don &apos;t do it ! It &apos;s stupid and dangerous .
There is one problem .
I am happy to hear your voice .
You simply don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;ll go next month .
How &apos;s that again ?
I should &apos;ve been there with you .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
You folks don &apos;t understand .
I just want to talk to you .
Your car &apos;s here .
He talks fast .
Tom always agrees .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished yet .
She came back an hour later .
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train .
You should apologize .
Tom said he wanted to leave .
I stand corrected .
I never learned to swim .
I know it &apos;s Tom .
Did he say that ?
Please let me know .
Tom walked over to where Mary was .
How did you get into our room ?
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever .
I like this book better than that one .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
He stood aloof from her .
I have a good friend in Boston .
We are not going on vacation .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it better .
I was slightly surprised .
Do you want to be here ?
What have you got ?
Thank you for telling me .
She is writing a letter now .
It &apos;s only a matter of time .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to see Tom soon .
If you &apos;d stop telling me not to be nervous , I probably wouldn &apos;t be so nervous .
Are you through with your work ?
Tom is going to school in Australia .
Tom &apos;s dog is white .
How old are you now ?
Need anything else ?
I don &apos;t need your help .
Tom may have told Mary about it .
Tom is going out again .
Tom is going to cook .
Tom was up all night .
Please don &apos;t tell anyone about this .
You may ask me any question you want .
I don &apos;t like your dad .
Tom said he was in love with Mary .
I think that my suitcase was stolen .
Thanks for asking me .
I still think about her from time to time .
Today we &apos;ll eat dinner later than usual .
Tom likes to take walks by himself .
That &apos;s good , too .
Tom is alone in the house .
I told you Tom would help us out .
What &apos;s it look like to you ?
I forgot it .
Tom knows he has to do it .
Tom got off the train .
You aren &apos;t alone anymore .
Don &apos;t look into my room .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve let me know earlier .
This is a mistake .
I can understand what she is saying .
Tom never came .
I didn &apos;t buy anything at that store .
I think we can go on our way now .
There are many books in my room .
I really mean it .
We can do better than that .
Tom and I &apos;ll be here for three weeks .
Tom realized that he had fallen in love with Mary .
I love my father .
I cannot read without glasses .
I can &apos;t do this .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who did that .
Tom knows exactly what kind of person Mary is .
There &apos;s been an accident .
The police are after me .
I thought you &apos;d say that .
What do you want to be ?
I want to know where they are .
He bought his daughter a new dress .
We &apos;ll never forget that .
Tom doesn &apos;t look old .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom told me .
Nobody was helping us .
That &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
He introduced his daughter to me .
I wrote this song just for you guys .
Will it snow tonight ?
No one saw a thing .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
Are you willing to drive me to the station ?
Is that supposed to be a question ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about Australia .
Tom is my father .
I don &apos;t like it when you do that .
He is taller than me by a head .
&quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re welcome . &quot;
Tom has been nice to everybody .
I &apos;ve had enough to eat .
Tom works eight hours a day .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything to me about that .
I have to see this .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
Summer is coming .
I have hardly any money with me .
We have fish for dinner today .
I &apos;m going to visit Tom in the hospital .
I do not feel like drinking beer tonight .
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom ?
I &apos;m one of you .
I think that &apos;s a good idea .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
How was the game ?
We don &apos;t have all day .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it here .
Have you read this ?
Tom looks very young .
It looks easy when you do it .
Tom can do all that and more .
I thought Tom would never stop talking .
What else do I need to do ?
Tom will be here any moment .
Tom has other things on his mind right now .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston yet .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s stuff ?
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry ?
You know Tom is telling the truth .
How much time do we have ?
How often do you go abroad ?
I &apos;m not here every day .
I don &apos;t care what people say .
School is finally over .
Tom has been in Australia for three days .
How old were you then ?
Are you planning to stay ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
We &apos;re still looking for Tom .
You can do that tomorrow .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
Maybe it &apos;s true .
It was impossible for him to solve the problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
My father plays tennis every Sunday .
You can &apos;t see Tom today .
Tom is at home , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good boy .
School is out .
I wonder who they are .
I don &apos;t watch much TV .
I was a little afraid .
You have to stop it .
This river is dangerous for children to swim in .
I don &apos;t blame you .
I asked Tom if he would mind doing that .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia in ages .
She brought me a cup of tea .
I don &apos;t get paid as much as I &apos;d like .
I had to open my suitcase .
Is this your lunch ?
I &apos;m not as tall as he is .
You can &apos;t have the job .
Tom made many mistakes .
You need not do it at once .
The shirt is large for me .
Being tired , she went to bed early .
Come and see me tomorrow .
Tom speaks fairly quickly .
Let &apos;s get together tomorrow .
She likes to run .
Tom introduced Mary to his mother .
Is this Tom &apos;s car ?
He stayed there for three days .
It &apos;s almost seven . We have to go to school .
I &apos;m going to need some help .
The teacher cannot have said such a thing .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to change .
I don &apos;t want to go to school tomorrow .
We &apos;ve got each other .
Both of you are right .
I want to visit you .
He asked me for my phone number .
Tom arrived at the hotel .
You didn &apos;t tell Tom anything , did you ?
I want to go and see Tom .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was afraid .
Please come over here .
I don &apos;t know that girl &apos;s name .
I have everything here that I need .
I &apos;d like to go somewhere else now .
Take some money just in case you need it .
If there &apos;s anything you want to do , you should do it if you can .
Today , I had a lot of troubles .
Tom is getting better .
Tom began pacing .
Tom wants me to be his girlfriend .
Tell me the reason why you married her .
You don &apos;t have to worry about a thing like that .
Don &apos;t look at Tom .
How were you able to do all that ?
I like you just the way you are .
I love the idea .
The computer is new .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a bad idea .
I don &apos;t suppose it &apos;s going to rain .
We all die .
It &apos;s a welcome change .
Does he have money ?
I did it for him .
Don &apos;t open that door for anybody .
We &apos;re all done .
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
Tom is about the same age as Mary .
This is where Tom worked .
When can we eat ?
I don &apos;t like to go outside when it &apos;s raining .
Tom studied French .
Tom , you &apos;ll be here for me if I need you , won &apos;t you ?
What do you make of this ?
I got a new camera .
I won &apos;t need you .
I lost my key somewhere around here .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I want you to wait for me .
I expect to come .
Is Tom one of your friends ?
Can you find her ?
She &apos;s not my girlfriend .
I will study abroad when I have finished school .
I forgot something in my car .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;ll live .
Tom has many friends living in Boston .
I asked Tom a lot of questions .
Can we talk to Tom ?
What &apos;s with Tom ?
Tom was in the house .
We &apos;ll do it .
He was alone .
May I say something ?
It might be too late .
How could you do that ?
What can I do for you this evening ?
Why does Tom want me to do that ?
Tom and Mary are my best friends .
I just want your love .
I go to the movies every week .
He came back from America .
We &apos;ll do it together .
Tom had a good idea .
Thanks for being you .
What I want to know is how Tom got here .
Tom told everyone that Mary knew how to do that .
If only I had asked for your advice .
I want to want what you want .
Why did you do it , Tom ?
Tom has fewer friends than Mary .
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive ?
I &apos;ll be in my car .
Why can &apos;t I see you ?
Tom got angry with us .
This is not okay .
Tom seemed sick .
Is there a hospital nearby ?
Why can &apos;t animals talk ?
I will do anything for you .
I would go to the movies if I had the time .
Is there a telephone here ?
English is the world &apos;s language .
Who was here ?
People listen to Tom .
I was awake .
There is an apple under the desk .
I think this book is worth reading .
When you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
She gave him her name and telephone number .
I bought her a watch .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I can &apos;t believe anything Tom says anymore .
Tom is watching television .
I &apos;m very good at swimming .
You got hurt , didn &apos;t you ?
Who told you I couldn &apos;t speak French ?
Tom always keeps his word .
You need to learn not to ask so many questions .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so amusing .
Is Tom dangerous ?
Tom isn &apos;t much older than Mary .
You know what I want .
Tom and Mary are going to get married next month .
You ought to have known better .
It would be better if you went by train .
Tom probably won &apos;t win anymore .
It was an immediate success .
Tom won &apos;t stop .
I wish I could stop thinking about Tom .
It &apos;s not like that .
Who called me ?
I must help him .
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary .
I &apos;d love to , but I can &apos;t .
He was drunk on beer .
I can &apos;t stand kids .
Have you told your parents ?
There are too many of them .
You have a beautiful voice .
We have had more rain this year than last year .
Who was that girl you were with at the beach today ?
I know Tom is mad .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
I was at work .
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends .
Here &apos;s what I don &apos;t understand .
I like your car .
My father has made me what I am .
Tom says he likes it .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for me .
Tom told me not to do it this way .
Are you alone ?
Can you tell me what this is ?
He asked a favor of me .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
I &apos;ll have what he &apos;s having .
The teacher can &apos;t have said such a thing .
Your son is dating my daughter .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to work .
You know what Tom wants .
Isn &apos;t life beautiful ?
Do you have some wine ?
I can &apos;t think of anything that might help .
Tom helped the old man across the street .
I found Tom there .
No one believes him .
Why aren &apos;t you with your parents ?
Tom and Mary are afraid of John .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston ?
There it is .
Girls don &apos;t like you .
Tom and Mary were alone in the park .
We hardly know each other .
I didn &apos;t get home until 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve still got a lot of work to do .
If I were you , I would not do it .
I &apos;ve never been better .
No one saw Tom .
We &apos;re not coming .
I am feeling much better now .
Money isn &apos;t everything , but if you have no money , you can &apos;t do anything .
She &apos;s about the same age as I am .
I want to hear what Tom has to say .
I &apos;m thirty now .
Did Tom say why he wasn &apos;t coming ?
I know what I did .
How do you say &quot; I love you &quot; in French ?
I do not know where to wait for her .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m not hungry .
Are you from here ?
Tom understands that .
Tom found my bike .
You made too many mistakes .
Tom wasn &apos;t that bad .
They are talking about this and that .
Thanks for seeing me .
Why don &apos;t you ever say it ?
Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
Tom was very old .
Tom walked past the table where Mary was sitting .
I &apos;d like to be young again .
You should arrive at school before eight .
You should &apos;ve kept your mouth shut .
Where &apos;s the dog ?
He doesn &apos;t like eggs .
Tom has just told me that he found a new job .
Tom appears satisfied .
You &apos;re my son .
I want to go with you to the movies .
It &apos;s really cold today .
Tom will sing .
He doesn &apos;t listen to me .
I don &apos;t like you .
You don &apos;t understand me .
Tom can swim very well .
I can &apos;t help Tom with his homework .
My shoes are the same size as his .
I &apos;m going to study .
Tom was told to go home .
They won &apos;t have a chance .
Tom is a slow walker .
Give me your telephone number .
Who doesn &apos;t think so ?
Where &apos;s the beach ?
This was no accident .
I never saw her again .
Tom is sure to come .
This is new to me .
I can &apos;t love anyone but you .
When I came home , Tom was watching TV .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to say .
I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
She is good at swimming .
I wonder if Tom is still outside .
You &apos;ll know soon enough .
How come you didn &apos;t come ?
I really want to know what &apos;s happening here .
There is one thing that I don &apos;t understand .
Why do you think ?
I know that you &apos;ve been waiting for this .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to college .
That was hard to believe .
Tom was sleeping .
I need a lot of books .
I need it today .
What &apos;s happening here ?
I bought a watch .
That can &apos;t be the good news .
What am I going to do about it ?
I may have told you such a thing , but I don &apos;t remember it at all .
Did you see the accident ?
I spoke to Tom yesterday .
I thought that I saw something .
I don &apos;t have anything else .
We can &apos;t turn back .
I have to live with it .
Do you know what Tom ate for lunch ?
Have Tom do it .
We &apos;re friends now .
I didn &apos;t know Tom lived in Boston .
I thought it would be a good idea .
Do you know whether she can speak English ?
Can &apos;t we go with Tom ?
He asked his father to take him to the store .
I would like to give him a present for his birthday .
She is free from care .
What &apos;s it going to be ?
Where are Tom and Mary ?
He loves her .
Take it .
All men are equal .
There is something I must know .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to believe .
That &apos;s not how Tom sees it .
We &apos;ll deal with that later .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sleepy .
You know almost everything about me .
You can wait in this room .
Tom knows Boston .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How are things going with you ?
Tom is no longer at home .
I don &apos;t remember any of it .
You look very good .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
Tom wondered if Mary would like the gift he bought her .
You should really drink less coffee .
Tom has a good chance of winning the election .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will say .
I bought Tom a new car .
Mary was thinking about her question .
He won &apos;t like this .
Tom will deal with it .
Tom would love to see this .
I &apos;m hoping you can help me .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
I am pretty sure .
I don &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
Tom says that he &apos;ll be at the meeting tomorrow .
He can speak 10 languages .
Let Tom go .
What does it say ?
Where are you ?
I &apos;m happy with that .
I said everything I had to say .
Tom didn &apos;t return till 2 : 30 .
You should wait for Tom .
You should have one of us do it .
He hadn &apos;t eaten anything the whole day and was hungry .
Can you do it ?
The car pulled up in front of the bank .
Are you ready , Tom ?
Don &apos;t leave the bicycle in the rain .
That &apos;s better than nothing .
Tom was foolish .
I didn &apos;t say anything to anyone .
I &apos;ve been seeking an answer to your question .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Your book is on the desk .
I &apos;ll definitely never do that again .
There is a river beside the house .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me Tom was here ?
Tom isn &apos;t as old as I am .
They saw Tom .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s family .
The station was deserted .
That &apos;s his house .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Tom wants to learn how to dance .
Can I go with you ?
When did you and Tom do that ?
What made you do this ?
I thought that Tom might be able to help us .
They called .
Why is the dog here ?
It wasn &apos;t that hard .
I didn &apos;t even know that .
We &apos;ll be happy .
You &apos;re way too late .
Tom is contented .
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
That girl looks like a boy .
There are a few problems .
We can &apos;t help Tom .
Tom said he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
Tom has been riding the bus to work .
Where &apos;s your hat ?
Since you have nothing to do with this matter , you don &apos;t have to worry .
Tom died three weeks later .
Tom and Mary want to know more about John .
I only have a week to get this done .
Have you told Tom &apos;s mother ?
Are you guys still together ?
Tom is the one , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom is watching TV in his room .
What do you want to hear ?
I &apos;m a good teacher .
I &apos;m sure Tom would want you to do that .
He is over the hill , you know .
Let &apos;s go to eat together .
It &apos;s close by .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
I &apos;m not interested in what you think .
I think Tom is too old for Mary .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
You &apos;re out of danger .
What time do you expect me to be there ?
I made a bad decision .
I saw that coming .
Let &apos;s get together again tomorrow evening .
My sister died last year .
Stop ! You &apos;re hurting him !
I can only speak English .
Our son died in the war .
I want to do it myself .
I &apos;m in the house .
My dog sleeps under my bed .
Do you really want me to give your computer to Tom ?
My hands are full right now .
We &apos;re doing nothing .
I can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re really here .
You &apos;d better not do it .
Tom never gives me anything .
This is one of the best schools in the city .
I liked your story .
I &apos;ll try to explain it to you to the best of my ability .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t alone .
He &apos;s about the same age as you are .
I don &apos;t want to be your wife .
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
I feel very good .
I know how important this is to you .
Tom can speak French .
Do you have a dog ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m here .
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
He says he won &apos;t come .
What did they tell you ?
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
I have to learn French .
I don &apos;t have any more money .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
Tom already intends to leave early .
Tom is really busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t know if you remember me .
I say go for it .
You might want to ask Tom to help you .
He looked very happy .
Tom said that he would be here by 2 : 30 .
Who is this lady ?
Is there any possibility that he &apos;ll win the election ?
Tom ran home as fast as he could .
I &apos;d like a glass of wine .
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not .
What &apos;s it doing out here ?
I said I &apos;d look after Tom .
Tom was dead .
Tom just wanted Mary to help him a little more with the children .
What &apos;re you doing with this ?
When do I get there ?
It won &apos;t be long before my husband comes back .
He believes everything that I say .
Tom came to see me three days ago .
What gives ?
He &apos;s looking at me .
Are you scared ?
Give the keys to Tom .
How are you , Tom ?
What other choice did I have ?
I just finished .
I have never seen such a thing .
Please feel free to use my dictionary .
I fell in love with her .
You &apos;d better not tell Tom .
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
I wish Tom were here now .
What &apos;s not to like ?
Can I get you a beer or something ?
I think it &apos;s around here .
You must take care of the dog .
Have you read this book already ?
You haven &apos;t even tried .
Everyone does it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to drink anything else .
He often comes late to school .
Tom is driving too slow .
I &apos;ll show you my new car .
Let &apos;s do this later .
Let Tom know we &apos;ve got a problem .
Who stole the apples ?
Tom seemed calm .
Tom will call you later .
The report cannot be true .
They know how to swim .
You should ask Tom first .
That &apos;s not how I see it .
How many times have I told you ?
No one could tell where she was .
Nobody tells me anything around this place .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t here .
I want to go there once again .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting .
We have to leave now .
Tom is mad .
The school is within walking distance of my house .
She works in a bank .
What do your children usually eat for breakfast ?
He doesn &apos;t know what to do with his money .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me ?
We &apos;ve arrived .
Tom wears his hair long .
Tom and Mary are both in the classroom .
You &apos;ll never forget it , I &apos;m pretty sure .
Thank you for the present you gave my son .
Let &apos;s not ever do this again .
Tom seems to agree with us .
Are Tom and Mary really engaged ?
I &apos;m sure Tom will tell Mary .
I wasn &apos;t nervous .
I want to visit you .
We walked here .
You &apos;re unkind .
Would you stop that , please ?
She may not come .
You can &apos;t pretend this didn &apos;t happen .
What Tom did was very wrong .
I don &apos;t want you to think I &apos;m crazy .
Tom can &apos;t handle this job on his own .
I went to the airport by taxi .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
We can &apos;t do it without you .
What &apos;s there to eat ?
No one could see us .
I &apos;ll telephone you every night .
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
Tom should &apos;ve told us about that earlier .
You &apos;re driving me nuts .
Why do you think I &apos;m here ?
You won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
I &apos;m alone with Tom .
Tom has had a bad week .
He has a little money .
Tom said he &apos;d be home for dinner .
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
What did Tom just say to you ?
She is not to blame .
What can you tell me about Tom ?
He may have missed the plane .
Did you understand what he had in mind ?
Tom should leave now .
You can say whatever you want .
Why do you want to die ?
Tom knows I like him .
I wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I know what Tom is doing .
He never keeps his word .
I will never see him again .
Can you show me how to do that job ?
What do you want to hear from me ?
We &apos;ve got to do something .
You &apos;re going to like it .
I &apos;m listening to you .
Have you seen this ?
You &apos;re from Boston , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom slammed the door in Mary &apos;s face .
I almost forgot to do my homework .
How has your weekend been so far ?
I was expecting you last night .
Tom came home from school earlier than usual .
How did Tom find you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come yet .
You can leave the room now .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s father .
Tom likes what he does .
This book is heavy .
Tom &apos;s older than me .
I hope that she will help me .
My mother is three years older than yours .
We &apos;ll help you .
I know what you did in Boston .
Tom and Mary are getting married next month .
I thought Tom had something to tell you .
The entire town was under water .
Tom likes to study in the library .
Tom always drives too fast .
No one wanted to talk about it .
How lucky we are !
Do you know whose car this is ?
Please don &apos;t speak French here .
Please tell Tom Mary called .
He &apos;s her friend .
Can &apos;t you stay a little longer ?
I &apos;ll be home late today .
I &apos;m glad you like my apartment .
Tom doesn &apos;t like school .
We &apos;ll be home soon .
Why are you in Boston ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m not going to let Tom sing .
He is riding a bicycle .
He is old enough to understand it .
Leave that box where it is .
I will explain it to him .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom .
Do you want to do it again ?
Tom likes to stay home and read books on weekends .
We hardly ever agree on anything .
Tom and Mary want to see us .
I want to know why you don &apos;t like me .
Tom wants to have nothing further to do with you .
Do you know what time that accident happened ?
Many thanks .
I was born in this hospital .
I &apos;d like to know where you are .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
Tom was in Boston last week .
I only had two glasses of wine .
You don &apos;t have to go to the party unless you want to .
You know the drill .
Tom was crazy about Mary .
Did that surprise you ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
Tom told everybody he was able to speak three languages .
She &apos;s very interested in music .
Don &apos;t look at it .
Did you help Tom ?
Leave out this word .
He wears his hair long .
Tom stayed there .
That &apos;s how I came to know her .
Did you read this morning &apos;s newspaper ?
Tom went to see Mary in Boston .
You must go .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much .
What else did you buy ?
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd .
That wasn &apos;t what I wanted to hear .
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
I hope to see you soon .
I know what his name is .
I am afraid I can &apos;t help you .
She will give you what money she has .
I don &apos;t want them .
Tom doesn &apos;t feel like cooking .
How could this have happened ?
I remember it very well .
Tom isn &apos;t that stupid .
How do you pronounce that ?
I won &apos;t tell Tom what I want to do .
I &apos;d like to show you something .
She &apos;s my first love .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
I told you I didn &apos;t want any coffee .
This suitcase is too heavy for you .
I think Tom is likely to be very hungry by the time he gets home tonight .
Tom will never know .
Tom knew that something was about to happen .
He has stayed at the hotel for five days .
Tom is a big man .
Don &apos;t let me die .
You &apos;ll do exactly as I say .
Everyone knows about Tom .
That &apos;s your decision .
Get back here .
It wasn &apos;t my idea .
I detest Tom .
All dogs need lots of love .
Tom always seems to be mad at everyone .
Take as much or as little as you &apos;d like .
I can &apos;t figure out how this happened .
We &apos;ll see to it later .
You should take a vacation .
She probably knows .
Tom made Mary swim .
How did you find out Tom didn &apos;t need to do that ?
It &apos;s not that noticeable .
She visited him in Boston .
I have to try .
Don &apos;t you want to hear my side of the story ?
Isn &apos;t it a bit small ?
This is a dress that Mary made by herself .
He can speak five languages .
I &apos;m going running .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle .
I &apos;m not sure how Tom will do it .
They want to come .
Where were you when Tom needed your help ?
I &apos;m going home with Tom .
I didn &apos;t see Tom at all yesterday .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have said that .
We know we &apos;ve got big problems .
Is Boston a big city ?
I think I know what Tom is doing here .
You should not speak so loud .
I have seen it a lot .
Tom has only himself to blame .
Tom loves being around people .
Did you hear that ?
Many people were there .
Is that it ?
I tried it before .
I am too short .
I &apos;d better see him .
Do they know you &apos;re here ?
I didn &apos;t really know what I was doing .
What happens tomorrow ?
You are the man I &apos;ve been looking for .
I &apos;m not good at it .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
I don &apos;t see him .
I &apos;ll wait outside .
I won &apos;t be leaving until tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t understand anything .
I know you can make it better .
I expected you home three hours ago .
No one speaks this language anymore .
What was the weather yesterday ?
Your brother got married , didn &apos;t he ?
How did you come to know this ?
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
You must think of your family .
You may take this .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom very much recently .
No one will change anything .
What you &apos;re doing is wrong .
How long have you been in this town ?
How many times have you been there ?
They &apos;re going .
He &apos;ll be there , rain or shine .
How can you still be hungry ?
I &apos;ll be there in a couple of hours .
Tom canceled .
Give them money .
I was not drunk .
Don &apos;t ask me to do that .
I &apos;ve done things I &apos;m not proud of .
I wanted to do that last week , but didn &apos;t have the time .
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
I wish that I could give you something .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
You should &apos;ve done it yourself .
I don &apos;t want to do this here .
Can you tell me a little about yourself ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want us .
He wants to go .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
You can only use it once .
Each of them was given a prize .
I want one .
She seldom goes out .
Tom drove Mary to work yesterday .
I seldom eat meat anymore .
I am truly happy for you .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
Tom frightens me .
We just got back from Boston .
Everybody knows his name .
No one knows what has happened to him .
I got a letter from a friend of mine in London .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary since October .
I did not think that he would help us .
Tom is going to be there , too .
I want to give Tom this .
Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I heard Tom &apos;s voice .
Are you sure you don &apos;t need my help ?
Everyone is counting on us .
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
Everyone is very proud of you .
I always do that .
He rarely stays home on Sunday .
To me , it is important .
I know you aren &apos;t that stupid .
I forgot my wife &apos;s birthday .
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom helped Mary in the kitchen .
Tom would wait .
Why are you under the desk ?
Do you know where Tom has been the past three weeks ?
Tom has told me a lot about you .
It is very expensive .
He was all alone in the house .
Can you make room for me ?
You can stay with us .
The tall man came out of the house .
Have you already met her ?
I don &apos;t like being alone .
How do you go to school ?
Tom wrote a letter .
How many vacations do you have a year ?
You missed Tom by about three hours .
Only Tom knows the truth .
They heard Tom .
We used to be best friends .
You &apos;ll have to come with me .
Did you buy a new car ?
It &apos;ll never happen .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel like going .
She loves Tom .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really talking to you .
We have to stop .
I almost forgot it .
I got plenty of help .
You &apos;re in great danger .
What are you doing there ?
We all love Tom .
I found it later .
Look at the flowers in the park .
My mother gets up early every morning .
Tom &apos;ll talk .
I thought he might come .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
He &apos;s a little nuts .
I &apos;ll go with Tom .
Maybe Tom can help you .
There are still a lot of things to do .
Do you really think Tom is going to be there ?
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom needs to do that as soon as possible .
Tom had the whole place to himself .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play with the other children .
I really enjoyed reading your story .
This money is mine .
You should know it .
My sister is crazy about tennis .
No one saw me .
Tom is already asleep .
When I was your age , I had a boyfriend .
He is playing in his room .
I don &apos;t want to die like this .
I feel like I &apos;ve already been here sometime .
That &apos;s the only way .
You won &apos;t be needing that .
Tom really made it happen .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
It is not my day .
May I go with you ?
Tom asked me if I were hungry .
He needs to answer the question .
I will be back soon .
I &apos;m dying to see you .
I want a new kitchen .
You &apos;re cooperating .
I asked him not to drive so fast .
Tom probably won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t understand any of it .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
He stayed at a hotel for a couple of days .
There &apos;s no one like you .
I know where you are .
Did Tom have his dinner ?
Is Tom still mad ?
His letter says he &apos;ll arrive next Sunday .
Tom and Mary know the truth .
I think it would be better if I went alone .
We both have to stay in Australia until the end of October .
What were you doing at that time ?
How badly was Tom injured ?
Tom will change .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not a good idea .
Don &apos;t you have anything to do ?
No one but Tom does that .
All these books are mine .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m glad you brought it up .
Did you find someone to help you ?
Tom knows what Mary did three days ago .
Why isn &apos;t Tom asleep ?
Tom is no longer with the company .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
She heard him sing .
Tom is on holiday with his parents .
Tom could &apos;ve bought this car .
You &apos;re a good mother .
What were Tom and Mary doing at John &apos;s house ?
They went to the beach .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to college .
Tom is likely going to get out of the hospital tomorrow .
I saw her play the piano .
Tom lost weight very quickly .
I thought I &apos;d lost Mary forever .
Tom likes living in Boston .
Why is everyone scared of Tom ?
You know Tom can &apos;t do that very well .
What does he say in his letter ?
I rarely see Tom anymore .
I wonder why Tom wants to buy that house .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money to buy a house .
We were all a little tired .
You got what you deserved .
We didn &apos;t expect it to take this long .
Where do you think Tom is going to live ?
Is there any coffee in the kitchen ?
Tom has a very beautiful daughter .
What are you cooking ?
I saw Tom .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have a lot of money on him .
My father does not like music .
That &apos;s not what we have to do .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
I thought I could count on you .
They love us .
Tom didn &apos;t know where Mary was .
I want Tom to see this .
If Tom goes , I &apos;ll go , too .
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
I &apos;ve already had my supper .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom had no idea Mary was sick .
Tom didn &apos;t even know how to write his own name .
We have lots to do .
I don &apos;t think this is how it &apos;s done .
We &apos;re very disappointed .
The sky is clear almost every day .
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Where are my keys ?
There are a lot of people here .
You &apos;d better tell me what happened .
Do you want a cup of coffee ?
Tom goes to work by car .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
Tom went to visit Mary in the hospital .
Where are you from ?
I &apos;m here because I want to be .
Do you have beer ?
Go to bed .
We &apos;ve wasted enough time .
I don &apos;t want to think about what could have happened .
It &apos;s nine-thirty .
She &apos;s six years older than I am .
Tom said Mary was willing to help us do that .
We &apos;ll be in Boston all week .
You have to believe in something .
I didn &apos;t want to be here in the first place .
Tom waited nervously .
I should have told her that I love her .
This price is too high .
Tom should &apos;ve done that with us .
I &apos;m not that hungry .
Tom &apos;s grandfather couldn &apos;t read .
She helps us .
What about you , Tom ?
Have you ever heard Tom sing ?
I &apos;m sure my passport is in this room somewhere .
I &apos;m doing this for you .
Tom and Mary look very happy together .
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
It &apos;s none of your business .
He has never been abroad .
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
I thought you said the police would never find us here .
Tom watched Mary eat .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where .
Whatever makes you happy makes me happy .
She is teaching us French .
Tom will never change .
I &apos;ll never forget what you told me .
I can &apos;t speak English at all .
Her father died .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
Tell it to him , not me !
I want to be like Tom .
You never stop , do you ?
That boy showed no fear .
Tom didn &apos;t learn how to do that until he was thirty .
He had no memory of the accident .
I &apos;m really sorry about Tom .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house .
What &apos;s the matter with Tom ?
Who fell ?
What &apos;re you guys doing here ?
The way I see it , he is right .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything yet .
Did you enjoy it ?
I love to go to the movies .
Why do you like Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do next .
She &apos;s putting the children to bed .
I &apos;ll always love you . No matter what .
You should &apos;ve introduced yourself .
If you are hungry , you can eat the bread .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom made his mother happy .
Tom left .
I like that one .
We can still get there on time .
Tom told me he wanted to quit .
I thought you &apos;d never visit us again .
Tom said he could help Mary .
I can &apos;t remember how to do it .
She took a taxi to the hospital .
What is going on here ?
It &apos;s very white .
I think Tom wants something to eat .
It was quiet again .
I &apos;m asking you what you think .
What happened to my suitcase ?
I must find it .
This isn &apos;t the first time that you &apos;ve been late .
Yesterday was a good day .
It &apos;s hot today .
I already know how to drive .
We have yet to learn the truth .
Nobody likes war .
Tom understood .
As I told you earlier , I can &apos;t help you .
I &apos;m going to give you something .
I was quite surprised .
I was stupid enough to believe Tom .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re welcome here .
There are only three days left .
Won &apos;t you give me a little money ?
Do you know what they want ?
I got a lot to say .
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t here .
Tom told me I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary .
Who wrote this letter ?
They &apos;re too big .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him somewhere before .
We didn &apos;t see anybody .
I can &apos;t figure out why he didn &apos;t tell the truth .
They haven &apos;t learned anything .
This is not a good idea .
He was not at all satisfied .
You should &apos;ve phoned me right away .
Tom said something .
Have you found anything ?
I don &apos;t like what &apos;s going on .
He seems to know nothing about the matter .
They were destined never to meet .
You should have come earlier .
She seemed uninterested .
I do not have a sister .
We will never do it again .
That won &apos;t be hard to do .
Tom saw me .
You &apos;re my brother and I love you .
Tom is her brother .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good or bad .
I want to go to a hotel .
Why weren &apos;t you at home yesterday ?
She quit smoking .
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
The party was such a great success .
Do you let your children drink coffee ?
Your time is running out .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
I had a puppy when I was a boy .
You can sleep here if you want .
He had a lot of things to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about money .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;ll happen .
I &apos;m very strong .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
You are deceiving yourself .
I &apos;ll give him a buzz .
This box is very heavy , so I can &apos;t carry it .
That &apos;s what I would do in your place .
I missed my bus this morning .
Can you do that again ?
It isn &apos;t hard to do .
Tom knows his stuff .
I asked where he had been .
I hope to hear from you .
I &apos;ll meet him tomorrow .
What am I going to do ?
I should do that right away .
Tom had some questions .
You &apos;re not young anymore .
Do you remember who I am ?
How long do I have to stay here ?
Tom thought about this .
Tom sat down on the sofa .
Look at that tall building .
Tom thought Mary was in Boston .
I see what you &apos;re doing .
Can we wait for Tom here ?
This is not safe .
How is Tom going to do that ?
I &apos;ve got something you both need .
Why do you have so many cats ?
We must keep calm .
I said that I would help him .
I think I &apos;ll be going .
It doesn &apos;t ring a bell .
I thought that , too .
I don &apos;t need a reason .
Tom doesn &apos;t work anymore .
I saw Tom there .
I pretended to work .
Tom works alone .
I can &apos;t afford to buy a car .
Tom was only pretending to be asleep .
Tom had nothing to do yesterday .
Tom saw that Mary was still asleep .
I &apos;ll be back after lunch .
What did they find ?
I &apos;ll come by car .
I told Tom to go home .
We &apos;re sure that it was an accident .
This is your chance .
Tom will go to Boston next week .
Tom will come for sure .
My father made my mother a cup of coffee just the way she likes it .
Tom is going to take you home .
You &apos;re really lucky .
Would you like for me to make you something to eat ?
Which way is the beach ?
The movie was really good .
Tom was not much older than Mary .
Tom takes himself very seriously .
We need water .
It &apos;s too cold .
I should probably tell Tom I &apos;m busy .
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
We want to leave .
Tom can speak French much better than me .
I need to talk to him .
He went into the bank .
I know where you want to be .
Where is the restaurant ?
I made my decision .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go there .
What are they doing there ?
He walks fast .
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is .
She looked me in the eye .
That &apos;s not what he said .
Maybe it &apos;s not interesting .
Have your own way .
He is much taller than I am .
No one was listening .
And just who might you be ?
Tom will definitely agree to do that .
Do you know how to fix this ?
Tom has waited for three hours .
What am I going to do with you ?
I have to go to the hospital .
Let go of my hair .
What shall we buy with that money ?
You must work .
Tom gave that to me .
I &apos;ve already talked to Tom about that matter .
I worked in Boston .
I &apos;ll go home .
We prefer to do our own work .
I want another cup of tea .
Can you stand ?
I &apos;ve never studied French .
I asked Tom to come yesterday , but he didn &apos;t come .
Are you going to be at this afternoon &apos;s meeting ?
He said that if he had much money , he would buy the dictionary .
You can ask Tom for help .
I &apos;m for it .
What time are you planning to leave ?
How may I help you ?
We must help each other .
He said that he was happy .
Do you need a ride ?
We &apos;re dancing .
I feel like doing that today .
That must be what love looks like .
Tom looks like he wants to say something .
What does Tom like to do that Mary doesn &apos;t like to do ?
I know his brother well .
Tom only has one small suitcase .
They &apos;ll find you .
He told me that he had lost his watch .
Who is playing the guitar ?
I meant to call you .
I &apos;d like to hear you play the piano .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom that .
I &apos;m not at all surprised .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t know Tom .
Tom has given us all this .
We &apos;ll soon change that .
Mary brought her daughter to work .
You should buy it for yourself .
I wonder whether or not Tom is nervous .
Do you want in on this ?
You could have come to me .
I don &apos;t care what you think .
Now I know why .
I hate it when you &apos;re right .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
Who wants a piece of cake ?
Everyone likes her .
She cooks very well .
He doesn &apos;t understand you .
Tom didn &apos;t let his children go to Mary &apos;s party .
They aren &apos;t dead .
I want us to win .
You &apos;ve got to see her home .
How many hours do you work per week ?
Come home before six .
She has married a nobody .
We will talk over the matter later .
Are you there ?
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
You have to find Tom .
Tom arrived late .
This is the watch that I bought yesterday .
I don &apos;t know the truth .
You &apos;ve got to help me learn to drive .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of anything .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I was going to write to you , but I forgot .
I &apos;m the only one who ever really liked Tom .
Tom and Mary want to see you .
I just wanted to make you proud .
Tom is listening to Mary .
I go to school here , too .
It &apos;s great to be here .
She doesn &apos;t understand you .
Look at Tom .
I &apos;m very happy that Tom is here .
You can expect me tomorrow .
You &apos;re not very hungry , are you ?
They walked .
The room was cold .
That &apos;s totally wrong .
How many times did you talk to Tom last week ?
I don &apos;t understand that question .
I feel sorry for him .
Tom went cycling with one of his friends .
I know why that is .
I heard someone in the crowd outside the station call my name .
&quot; Where is your book ? &quot; &quot; On the desk . &quot;
I told him everything .
She saw a lot of animals on the road .
That sometimes happens .
The book I bought last week was really interesting .
I am coming .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t remember you asking me to do that .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I &apos;m very proud of my father .
Tom may be hot .
We &apos;ll go .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
Tom opened the beer .
We don &apos;t expect Tom to live much longer .
Life &apos;s not easy .
Someone &apos;s coming .
Tom stayed awake .
I want an answer from you ASAP .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault .
One of my uncles lives in Boston .
Nobody knows why .
I &apos;ll give you until 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t think that you did all this homework by yourself .
I &apos;ll try my luck .
He seated himself on the bench .
I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch .
Tom has asked us not to do that .
I thought you might be able to tell me how to do this .
Can I sleep on the couch ?
Tom is capable of doing it .
Tom waited nearby .
I know Tom &apos;s father .
Give me your hand .
I &apos;m more than happy .
I wish we could just ask Tom .
Tom seemed to be very content .
I want to do that .
You &apos;re not the one who died .
The girl went to sleep .
I fail to see what &apos;s so funny .
Might I ask you a question ?
He needs that money .
How was your night ?
That doesn &apos;t mean anything .
Tom drove me home .
I don &apos;t have to study French .
Have you asked the others ?
What more do you want , Tom ?
You &apos;re not telling the truth .
It was big .
Do you have a crush on Tom ?
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Tom can &apos;t wait any longer .
Tom isn &apos;t finished doing that .
Did you see it ?
I want to use these .
The train hasn &apos;t come yet .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry anymore .
Tom said he was too tired to dance .
I have a few things to take care of .
Here is your bag .
Tom is Mary &apos;s son .
Tom and Mary are no longer on speaking terms .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
I wish I were a little taller .
What are the men doing ?
Tom is your teacher .
We &apos;re always careful .
Where are the parents ?
You &apos;ve got my phone .
Why not talk it over with your teacher ?
What &apos;s on TV ?
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will like this idea .
You look happy .
Do we know when they &apos;ll make their decision ?
She really needs your help .
I never really thought I &apos;d live this long .
I asked him to help me .
This bag is too heavy .
You know what to do , don &apos;t you ?
How did you get into our room ?
I need a cab .
My house is too small .
I saw your father .
I know each one of you .
I might be drunk , but I &apos;m not crazy .
I will not see him any more .
I &apos;m thankful to be alive .
How many students are there in your school ?
Tom is the man of the house .
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s no longer possible .
Tom was the last one to get here .
Please take another one .
What did you say your name was ?
That building is our school .
Tom is quite likable .
We &apos;re in the garden .
Is that really Tom &apos;s sister ?
I cannot help you .
I could barely speak .
Give me a little time .
Let &apos;s see what Tom has to say about Mary &apos;s plan .
Tom arrived ahead of Mary .
That can &apos;t be Tom .
Tom came into my room .
Meat is expensive .
Someone has been in my room .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was unafraid .
Tom is much taller than you .
Tom and I are going to be fine .
Tom likes you very much .
I was ready .
I know about that .
What else does Tom need ?
I regret that decision .
I knew you would get it .
Tom has lots of things to tell Mary .
Can you swim across the river ?
Tom pretended to not hear a thing .
I don &apos;t enjoy studying French .
I know that Tom works very hard .
I know where you were yesterday evening .
Did you watch the game ?
They regarded him as the best doctor in town .
I &apos;m sure this will happen again .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes you .
Did you like Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like me much .
I hope you &apos;ll come again some day .
Don &apos;t be crazy .
Are you from Australia ?
I made fun of him .
I don &apos;t like what we &apos;ve become .
I &apos;m really busy at the moment .
She seems happy .
I will be back in less than five minutes .
Tom can &apos;t read .
This isn &apos;t French . It &apos;s English .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
Everybody had a good year .
Tom will be here all evening .
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English .
What Tom said is true .
She will leave the hospital soon .
What about this one ?
She fell in love with the new teacher .
I &apos;ll go tomorrow if the weather is good .
You have something on your face .
I hardly even know you .
Have you read this book yet ?
Any questions ?
Who does Tom want to sing with ?
You &apos;re late .
You &apos;ve found it .
Give it up .
I like this better than that .
Tom &apos;s grandfather was illiterate .
Tom never showed up last night .
It &apos;s totally different .
I didn &apos;t want to talk to anyone .
Tom didn &apos;t read the newspaper yesterday .
I would read this book , but I don &apos;t have the time .
This is how Tom did it .
He asked his friend for advice .
Tom eats lunch at his desk .
I &apos;m coming back home by bus .
She came to see me .
May I hold your hand ?
You &apos;re drunk .
I may know Tom .
Tom was hard to please .
Tom was probably born in Australia .
When are we going to use it ?
Is his story true ?
Get a grip on yourself !
I can &apos;t reach Tom .
I know you &apos;re not like that .
I &apos;ll always love Tom .
There were many students in the room .
He helped me do my homework .
When were you in Boston ?
That would be a mistake .
Try harder next time .
I think you &apos;re amazing .
Tom was hurt .
I &apos;m very glad to see you .
Tom said he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
I &apos;m not like that .
Tom is calm .
That &apos;s all wrong .
Turn it off .
Is this your suitcase ?
What do you want for breakfast ?
I saw you yesterday .
Have another drink on me .
I said we &apos;d get one .
They went away .
Tom looked around the room , but he didn &apos;t see Mary .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
The box was full of books .
I &apos;ll quit .
Tom often plays the guitar .
She knew what needed to be done .
May I speak to you alone ?
They know me .
His story turned out to be true .
He rarely gives up .
Tom is Mary &apos;s brother , not her father .
I can &apos;t tell you what I think .
It &apos;ll be hot .
That &apos;s my job , not Tom &apos;s .
It is a long story .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me here , does he ?
Tom asked Mary not to leave .
You can &apos;t lose what you don &apos;t have .
Tom took a look at what Mary had written .
They don &apos;t get it .
I can speak English .
I know Tom would love to see you .
What type of person are you ?
You &apos;ve never told me your name .
I don &apos;t remember inviting you here .
I love watching you cook .
You have a brother , don &apos;t you ?
I wish Tom could be here with us today .
Do you really think I can help you ?
Tom lives near Mary .
Here comes the train .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m doing this .
I adhered to my decision .
There &apos;s nothing I can do .
Do you know where we &apos;re going ?
I like what I see .
Everyone knows it &apos;s true .
How do we look ?
I suppose you think I &apos;m rich .
You were always too busy to talk to me .
I don &apos;t need a lot of money .
Do you have a sister ?
You &apos;ll find something that interests you .
He still loves her .
Tom asked me to do that for him .
Do you want to stop ?
The rain prevented me from coming .
All I want to do now is sleep .
I would rather not go .
Please stop it .
They enjoy playing together .
Tom wants to declutter his home .
I &apos;m still the same person I used to be .
I was already tired .
He is afraid of making mistakes .
Tom &apos;s injured .
She is gracious to everyone .
It really happened , didn &apos;t it ?
I love you just the way you are .
Why weren &apos;t you able to do that ?
How much longer do you think it &apos;ll take ?
They say she &apos;s good at cooking .
I need some time to myself .
Come here soon .
Is there anything you need to do today ?
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
I want to take you with me .
You didn &apos;t let me answer .
Are you the new teacher ?
Tom always eats before going to work .
I can &apos;t stay .
I heard that Tom wasn &apos;t a good teacher .
Tom always believes me .
Why didn &apos;t you show up at the party last night ?
I know that it &apos;s difficult .
You were the one who told me it was safe here .
Please think about the problem .
Have you seen my new car ?
That car is really expensive .
Today is not so cold .
What is it you want ?
Tom has already decided .
I know everything I need to know .
Tom knows that he has to do that .
Tom tried to help .
I needed the money .
What &apos;s your location ?
Tom lives with his father .
I would like to do something else today .
What do they think it said ?
I think I won &apos;t do that .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
What &apos;s the name of the man who was talking to you ?
Tom &apos;s somewhere in the park .
Does what you do make you happy ?
Tom wasn &apos;t crazy .
I was very scared .
I think we &apos;d better wait another thirty minutes .
I don &apos;t remember anything else .
Her family is very large .
I &apos;ll never learn .
Tom was kept waiting for a long time .
Did Tom buy it ?
Tom wrote this book .
He had his car stolen yesterday .
I don &apos;t have it .
I wonder where Tom has gone .
Where were you ?
I do not have anything in my bag .
Aren &apos;t you going to introduce me ?
I like it when you do that .
How could that happen ?
You &apos;re definitely the best French speaker here .
Who was it that gave you that ?
No one will believe Tom .
No one was alive .
That was fun .
Tom was a bit nervous .
Tom has already eaten dinner .
I wonder what it could be .
I would like you to go home with me .
You better buy that book .
Did you tell Tom that ?
He needs money .
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom alone .
Tom wears glasses .
It can &apos;t be done .
My mother is at home .
We &apos;ll save a seat for you .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
He spent three years in jail .
It is going to rain very soon .
What &apos;s that on your face ?
Who would buy this ?
I heard someone calling my name .
I managed to make him understand it .
Today &apos;s my daughter &apos;s birthday .
We should visit Boston again .
You have no right to say so .
He has come !
Tom &apos;s business is doing very well .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
I only wanted to be helpful .
How do you know that , Tom ?
How &apos;s your family ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to drive the children to school tomorrow .
They say that he &apos;s very rich .
I would never say such a thing .
What I did was wrong .
Tom is coming with me to Boston .
I haven &apos;t eaten .
I am very tired .
I wish we &apos;d met earlier .
I can &apos;t remember your name .
He gave them food and money .
I &apos;m the person that did that .
I had no choice but to take the plane .
I &apos;m glad Tom enjoyed it .
It isn &apos;t there .
Tom isn &apos;t going to leave us .
I &apos;m sure that Tom will be here soon .
Tom gave Mary a ride home yesterday .
Reading a lot of books is a good thing .
Who &apos;d believe you anyway ?
He has bad eyes .
I &apos;d decided not to do that again .
You can &apos;t lose .
The war is over .
Tom never does that by himself .
He loves singing .
I do hope that he will get well soon .
I &apos;ve been to the bank .
I will be back soon .
Get lost !
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
Most people think so .
I &apos;m not too late , am I ?
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
Perhaps Tom is writing a letter .
Tom and I want you to come .
What makes you think that isn &apos;t true ?
He can swim fast .
Why aren &apos;t you going after Tom ?
I &apos;d be willing to do that .
It &apos;s Sunday today .
Did you put Tom up to it ?
That &apos;s what we think .
Haven &apos;t we met before ?
It &apos;s better than nothing .
Can you even speak French ?
We &apos;ll see you there .
I know my way around Australia .
Did you pay for the book ?
Most of her friends are boys .
I &apos;ll be taking the car .
I &apos;d like to know if that &apos;s true .
I like studying languages .
She wore glasses .
Are you for or against his idea ?
Are they your friends ?
Are you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
I &apos;ve told you the truth .
They did not work , either .
You won &apos;t believe what I just saw .
This is what Tom wants .
I am going , too .
He teaches English to his friends .
Tom wandered off .
The telephone is now out of order .
I &apos;m a little busy .
I paid good money for this .
I learned something today .
I went to school yesterday .
You can study here .
Tom would be glad to hear that .
It was hard to believe .
I cannot possibly help you .
Be careful not to make any mistakes .
I &apos;ll certainly do this .
It &apos;s just started raining .
Your hair is too long .
I said I didn &apos;t know Tom .
Who asked you ?
You don &apos;t need to go .
I remember giving him the key .
That &apos;s very dangerous .
We drove across the city .
I have a good dictionary .
He was alone .
He isn &apos;t able to buy a car .
We are coming .
I &apos;ll let you know .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to work here anymore .
You &apos;ve got my computer and I want it back .
My father works here .
Tom got on his horse .
That &apos;s not such a terrible idea .
Have you found an answer to this question ?
What kind of car do you drive ?
Why do you keep giving him money ?
I &apos;m going to go see Tom .
Tom is at home today .
You &apos;ll go far .
I thought you said you didn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
Are your parents in now ?
Take whatever you want .
Tom did that three times .
Is this it ?
Can &apos;t you help us ?
They can &apos;t hear me either .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
The party &apos;s over .
I can &apos;t afford a new car this year .
Are you through with this book ?
What &apos;s mine is yours .
Why won &apos;t Tom help us ?
I arrived here yesterday .
Tom knew Mary wasn &apos;t likely to do that .
Don &apos;t you want to play with Tom ?
I saw that .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like Tom .
Are you in danger ?
May I speak to you ?
Tom is scared of Mary .
Where &apos;s it from ?
He is about my size .
Is your father rich ?
What am I going to say to Tom ?
You ought to have apologized to her .
It cannot last long .
The baby fell asleep .
You live too far away .
You have only to give him a little help .
I have to do my homework .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know your name .
I &apos;m doing it for you .
Tom looks like he &apos;s rich .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
Being with you makes me happy .
This is all you have to do now .
She is living abroad .
Have you already eaten ?
This is for you , Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you call ?
They enjoy one another &apos;s company .
I &apos;m all out of money .
Tom can &apos;t really help us much .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with us .
You needn &apos;t do it at once .
You said so yourself .
What &apos;s so special about that ?
I was busy yesterday .
Can anyone answer my question ?
I &apos;ve been thinking of you all day .
How long have Tom and Mary been going out together ?
She wanted to be alone .
What are you going to do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French well .
Maybe we can talk about that later .
As it is , I can do nothing .
He cannot have done such a thing .
Tom won &apos;t listen .
I want Tom to go .
Can I use your telephone ?
Did Tom go alone ?
You aren &apos;t watching .
What &apos;re you reading ?
What would you like for supper ?
We watch TV together .
There is not much I can do to help , I am afraid .
I know some of the boys .
My hands are full .
Have you gone mad ?
Let &apos;s talk outside .
I received your message yesterday .
Is eating less meat a good idea ?
I think I &apos;ll be fine .
That &apos;s how we do things .
I &apos;d like to know what you think .
Why are you asking me ?
I know Tom can &apos;t understand French .
That is the house where he lives .
I want to know what you think .
Have a look at that picture .
Do you really want to know ?
What makes you happy , Tom ?
How bad is Tom hurt ?
We still need your help .
Tom looks really good .
Does Tom know how to do this ?
I &apos;d like you to have it .
Where do you eat lunch ?
I don &apos;t have a choice .
Tom lives above me .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to find me .
I will go .
Can you ride a bicycle ?
You must remain calm .
We &apos;re back .
I &apos;ll be glad when it &apos;s over .
We want Tom to say yes .
You couldn &apos;t solve the problem , could you ?
Tom wants to ask us a few questions .
They &apos;re not good .
It just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
Why don &apos;t you want me to tell anybody ?
I hope you &apos;re hungry .
Is his name really Tom ?
Tom has to come to Boston .
What do you want from me ?
Is everything ready now ?
I have one of those , too .
She is getting better day by day .
Tom never made it home .
I wasn &apos;t the one who asked Tom to do that .
I &apos;m not saying that what she did was right .
When can you start ?
Is French difficult ?
What &apos;re we doing here ?
There is a television in this room .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know how to write his own name .
Tom walked fast .
I think you &apos;ve done enough .
Maybe I should study French .
Tom won &apos;t make it .
Tom visited Australia .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re staying .
Tom is shirtless .
Is eating fish good for you ?
My money was stolen .
What are you wearing ?
I &apos;m a fast learner .
I thought the game was over .
My father is busy .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
She never found out the truth .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go swimming with us ?
She doesn &apos;t eat meat , does she ?
What &apos;s your location ?
Tom is going to be back from Australia tomorrow .
She gave me several books .
They &apos;re about to go .
You should &apos;ve let me help you .
We &apos;ll do great .
There was nothing in the box .
No pain , no gain !
It &apos;s not enough .
Your father is tall .
Where are your children now ?
Why are you alone ?
You are drunk !
Tom said he &apos;s fine .
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
He has a lot of land .
Tom was in the hospital for three weeks .
We &apos;re good to go .
This is your dog .
I bought a lot of books .
You have everything you need , right ?
It was a big mistake .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Can I hold your hand ?
Are you sick ?
I see the book .
Why is your mouth so big ?
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to read .
When are we going to do it ?
I could have bought that for you .
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
I want to see your mother .
Nobody came .
Tom intends to buy a new bicycle .
Tom and Mary grew up together .
What did you do yesterday ?
If that &apos;s true , then she &apos;s better than me .
Tom told Mary not to be afraid .
I &apos;m going to take you to Tom .
He is pigeon-toed .
He can be relied on .
Tom likes animals .
I can &apos;t live that kind of life .
What they told you is not true .
Tom doesn &apos;t study enough .
They &apos;re waiting for an answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t think so .
Tom wanted to know how Mary had become so rich .
Does it matter to you when we come ?
Tom came to my house yesterday .
It will be finished in a day or two .
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is now .
You &apos;re kind .
I know exactly where I am .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go to Boston .
Don &apos;t let children play in the road .
They found each other .
His mother died four years later .
Tom is about a head taller than me .
I still haven &apos;t paid Tom .
No one understands you .
What does Tom think about this ?
I can &apos;t reach it .
Tom must be nearly thirty .
I am happy to hear your voice .
The apple fell from the tree .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has to do that or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
I wish things were the way they used to be .
He &apos;s on his last legs .
Tom was already drunk .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s party .
Tom and Mary usually go to school by bicycle .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
I don &apos;t believe that anymore .
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
I have an older brother and a younger sister .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom .
That was really difficult .
He has no bicycle .
Tom opened his suitcase .
You can &apos;t leave me .
Tom is proud of his son .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to do that .
Tom says he loves it in Boston .
Is she so stupid that she believes that kind a thing ?
Did you understand what he said ?
You &apos;re a big boy .
How did you guys find me ?
I crossed the street .
I answered the phone .
They &apos;re able to sing .
Where did you come from ?
Tom was the one .
You need to do exactly what I tell you .
Tom drove to Mary &apos;s house .
I own a horse .
Tom has a lot of friends to help him .
That &apos;s actually a good idea .
I &apos;ve only been to Boston once .
Why do you always wear that hat ?
Tom made many mistakes .
Tom asked me whether I was hungry .
What else did you do there ?
Don &apos;t tell her about it .
Can you help us ?
Tom is in his office .
What do they know ?
This is accurate .
I &apos;m sorry , but my mother is out at the moment .
What &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
I couldn &apos;t care less .
She won &apos;t like this .
Tom will drive you to the airport .
I don &apos;t think I know you .
Tom never goes to school by bus .
Tom should probably do that tomorrow .
I wish I could do something .
We &apos;ve already talked about this .
It was a complete success .
You should do that right away .
I didn &apos;t ask for these .
I have to walk slowly .
I haven &apos;t seen him for a long time .
I remember seeing him .
I helped Tom find an apartment .
I guess Tom was right .
You &apos;re not very hungry , are you ?
Have you forgotten everything we &apos;ve done for you ?
What &apos;ll it be like ?
I can &apos;t wait for you .
Tom tires easily .
Tom hasn &apos;t played tennis for a while .
I hope it &apos;s not true .
Where were you born ?
How many hours did you work this week ?
Why didn &apos;t you just ask ?
You should &apos;ve phoned me .
These are very old books .
You should be proud .
I &apos;m not tired .
I think you &apos;re going to like this movie .
Everyone left , except for us .
The window is closed .
Why can Tom speak French so well ?
Tom won &apos;t be disappointed .
How old was Tom in this picture ?
I only want Tom .
Tom is too young to drink beer .
Tom is in prison .
You have made many mistakes .
Tom sat calmly .
Can you even speak French ?
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
She has never seen him .
You are really very good .
Mary just got her hair done .
We &apos;re still friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t let his children drink wine .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
I &apos;m alone now .
Leave it alone .
I speak English every day .
She lives with him in a small apartment .
This land is Tom &apos;s .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Tom sat down next to Mary on the bench .
I &apos;m still busy .
That &apos;s what you told me .
You must stay with me .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on around here .
Do you really want me to give your computer to Tom ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
She has something in her hand .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I &apos;m coming .
Which cup is yours ?
What is it you want to know ?
We need you .
Can Tom help us ?
They &apos;re animals .
My parents love me .
He seldom , if ever , comes .
I am sorry that my friend is not here .
You can &apos;t stay for long .
He is tired of reading .
I love meeting new people .
He is pleased with his new shoes .
He is always with me .
I know what it was .
Nobody takes me anywhere .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
He &apos;s wearing a new coat .
I called Tom .
Tom is the one who needs to do this .
I have something good to tell you .
I &apos;ll get in touch with Tom by telephone tomorrow and ask him to give us a hand .
My mother can &apos;t come .
May I ask a question ?
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
How many people work here ?
We don &apos;t want to know .
Tom seldom listens to music at home .
How have you been keeping ?
We &apos;re trying .
I think we can do it .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
I saw my grandfather last week .
You speak French , right ?
Let &apos;s not forget we never could have done this without Tom &apos;s help .
I can &apos;t wait to hear your voice , Tom .
I like speaking French .
According to what they say , that boy is very good at singing .
Tom doesn &apos;t fit in here at all .
What &apos;s your favorite city in the world ?
Tom wants something , but I &apos;m not sure what .
Tom is very busy now .
If anybody can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
Please help Tom .
Tom has finished .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s new or not .
We know that your name isn &apos;t Tom .
I &apos;m so hungry that I could eat a horse .
Tom immediately began doing that again .
There are many beautiful things on earth that I don &apos;t need .
No matter what happens , I &apos;ll stand by you .
Is that your son ?
Tom would like to stay young forever .
Tom never finishes his homework .
If anyone can do that , it &apos;s Tom .
Why do you like it ?
What &apos;s Tom have to say about this ?
He does not live there any more .
Tom is abroad .
Why does that make a difference ?
That &apos;s your decision .
I &apos;ll have them repair my car .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s uncle .
I &apos;ve just arrived in Boston .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
There is a desk in this room .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like Tom .
Tom has three of them .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
I know next to nothing .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
I could hardly tell who was who .
I can &apos;t play the piano , but she can .
Tom was late .
What is your decision ?
You can do that tomorrow .
I think Tom knows .
I &apos;ve got more books than I can read .
What do you do with your money ?
Do you know whose this is ?
I did that a lot .
I &apos;ll be present .
I don &apos;t know when he will come .
Both of us can speak French .
Father is in his office .
Have you read that book ?
Tom loves flowers .
Tom is enraged .
I heard the good news .
There &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
Give me a little money .
Tom wants to sleep on the beach .
Tom ate .
It &apos;s very nice of you .
Tom said that he &apos;d do just about anything for Mary .
It cannot be true .
No one knows her name .
Tom is going to make it .
I &apos;m not going to school today .
Tom said Mary is fine .
This first question is for you .
What is wrong with these people ?
We cannot afford it .
You gave me your word .
&quot; Where were you ? &quot; &quot; I was at a friend &apos;s house . &quot;
Everyone knows I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
We &apos;ve done nothing .
I know what I want to do .
Tom can drive now .
Let me do it my way .
I sometimes make mistakes .
I should &apos;ve studied more .
They &apos;re good people .
Tom said Mary is often late .
Tom must be dead .
That &apos;s what people say .
We &apos;re crazy .
It &apos;s your turn .
We &apos;re almost home .
Tom has been busy since this morning .
Tom asked Mary many questions about Australia .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
I want to quit .
You did a really good job .
I suppose you &apos;re hungry .
How long did you work for Tom ?
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
I don &apos;t think Tom will mind .
I know what Tom wants .
You can count yourself lucky !
I never thought I &apos;d see him there .
All of us will die sooner or later .
What have you been doing ?
I found the man I want to marry .
I &apos;m sorry about that .
Tom saw Mary swimming .
I like to eat apples .
I &apos;m the one they want .
We require your help .
She told her son to wait a minute .
Why weren &apos;t we told the truth ?
I had intended to go abroad .
My father will come home at seven .
Tom is very angry .
You &apos;re not alone , Tom .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
Tom is good at solving problems .
There &apos;s still a lot to do .
He was at home .
She left her son alone in the car .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
You &apos;ll love Australia .
Are you out there ?
This trip was a success .
Could you do that ?
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
I &apos;m very short .
Who would have thought Tom would change ?
What made you say that ?
Tom returned a few hours later .
I have been expecting you .
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston because that &apos;s where Mary lives .
I have to have that .
Tell Tom that I &apos;d like to help .
The boy has a watch in his hand .
Tom has been rather busy recently .
Tom wanted to meet you .
I said that quite a long time ago .
I don &apos;t know what to do and neither does anyone else .
Leave us .
I &apos;ll be home late today .
Someone needs to talk to Tom about what happened .
Are you guys hungry ?
I am truly happy for you .
Please have a seat .
Tom gave me a ride home .
Tom shouted at the top of his voice .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom .
He &apos;s coming .
I have to go to the police station .
I should &apos;ve stayed in bed .
I wouldn &apos;t want to die here .
Tom died Monday .
Do it once again .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
I know you &apos;re not doing that .
My father always gets nervous .
Tom gave me some good advice .
Let &apos;s try !
Tom will definitely come .
We shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
Tom has been quite busy recently .
Did you find anything else ?
Would you like anything to eat ?
Tom knows who we are .
What do you expect me to do ?
He was foolish enough to believe it .
I &apos;m feeling sort of tired .
Tom didn &apos;t have anything to say .
Is that what you &apos;d like ?
I don &apos;t care if anyone believes me or not .
I didn &apos;t know about it until I read the paper .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re having a good day .
Tom barely ate .
What &apos;ll this accomplish ?
Do you want me to ask Tom to do that for you ?
Tom gave Mary a tour of his house .
Tom will be ready for us in about ten minutes .
I didn &apos;t know that dogs swim well .
No one is going to understand you .
I &apos;m not very good at swimming .
Why do you like Boston so much ?
Tom read a book all morning .
I thought Tom was your brother .
Do you think that Tom and Mary are going to get back together ?
We &apos;re always hungry .
I was told to stay on the ship .
Why is that a problem ?
I haven &apos;t eaten lunch yet .
I &apos;m surprised Tom isn &apos;t with Mary now .
We &apos;ll find Tom .
Would you like me to explain it to you ?
They lost .
Tom hardly ever makes mistakes .
Do you think Tom knows Mary is married ?
I can &apos;t explain everything now .
Let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
Tom knows this place .
You should not give your children everything they want .
Can you be sure ?
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
Tom and Mary have been studying French together all afternoon .
Tom knew nothing about it .
How many people did you see in the park ?
To live without air is impossible .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t care .
I still have time .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
It &apos;s impossible that she knew about it .
Tom has to work late every night this week .
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
That will do .
You &apos;ll feel better tomorrow , I promise .
We don &apos;t need him .
Tom will like it .
Who wants tea ?
A meal without wine is like a day without sunshine .
I can &apos;t give up smoking .
I look forward to my birthday .
He knows where we live .
How could I help you ?
Who are you ?
How long will it take me to finish my homework ?
I &apos;ll take care of it .
Tom wants a new hat .
I can &apos;t understand what he is trying to say .
This is interesting .
You didn &apos;t come to school yesterday , did you ?
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
Did you just say something to me ?
It doesn &apos;t make Tom happy .
Tom knew something .
He hit me in the face .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you last week .
Tom doesn &apos;t live far away .
I have to go to bed .
I went to her house , but she was not at home .
This book is written in French .
Isn &apos;t that what you said ?
I look like Tom .
It &apos;s happened .
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
He did it while he was drunk .
I feel secure with him .
You must be very hungry now .
I &apos;ve never met him .
Tom says Mary is happy .
What does Tom want to do ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
This car is like new .
Where can we meet ?
Thanks for bringing Tom home .
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom .
You &apos;ve found something .
That &apos;s right !
Tom sometimes plays tennis with Mary .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed home .
I &apos;m sure about this .
What time is it ?
They are about the same age .
I &apos;m not looking forward to the evening .
Here &apos;s what we know .
Tom is getting bigger and bigger .
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
I hate that .
You alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
Look ! She &apos;s coming !
Tom walked back into the house .
I do not think that he will come .
I really want to go .
Tom could win .
This &apos;ll be fun .
What is Tom eating ?
It was where Tom said it would be .
They know who he is .
Do it once again .
I am too busy to go .
Tom didn &apos;t want to lose .
He is able to speak five languages .
Tom is too busy to come .
I &apos;m not rich , nor do I wish to be .
Don &apos;t listen to Tom .
He doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
How is everyone ?
When was the last time you were in Boston ?
I don &apos;t know and I don &apos;t want to know .
He has been to America .
I can &apos;t believe I actually said that .
She is like a mother to me .
We ought to leave now .
You should probably tell Tom how to do that .
I saw it from the window .
You and I are both students at this school .
Tom broke out of jail .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
Look ! There &apos;s a cat in the kitchen .
What &apos;s happened ?
We love it .
Are you up ?
It wasn &apos;t ours .
I need some coffee .
I think you should give Tom a chance .
Tom really wants to help .
Do you think Tom will ever do that again ?
There &apos;s a dog by the door .
I found Tom .
Next time , I &apos;ll drive .
You don &apos;t frighten me .
I fell into the water .
About how many books do you have ?
I got it .
Nobody tried to help Tom .
You don &apos;t have to be scared .
When &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
I &apos;ve eaten .
I have enough money to buy a car .
I can drive a car .
You need to start meeting women .
I shouldn &apos;t have brought it up .
I don &apos;t know . What do you think ?
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
I don &apos;t have to wear glasses any more .
I think we shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
Do we have one like it ?
They both got here late .
I have a lot of problems to solve .
When will it be ready ?
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
If I had money , I could buy it .
Why do people go to the movies ?
I know where you can find Tom .
I don &apos;t know what you think .
Mary has big eyes .
I &apos;m not sure if I can do that .
He won &apos;t listen to me .
Give me your phone .
I &apos;ve heard of you .
Tom wasn &apos;t ready to die .
It matters .
Are you busy ?
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
Do you have a minute ?
Please have a seat here .
It &apos;s not here .
I want to know what &apos;s so funny .
Tom lives somewhere in Australia .
Leave it where you found it .
I don &apos;t have time right now .
Have you made up your mind yet ?
Can you stay for dinner ?
Tom can &apos;t afford to send his children to college .
I can &apos;t help you unless you tell me the truth .
Tom took his own life .
Is there anything that I can do for you ?
You don &apos;t scare me .
I believe that he comes here .
Why did you buy this car ?
I come here every Monday .
We don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
Promise me you &apos;ll be careful .
The boy stayed quiet .
I &apos;ll be right there , Tom .
Tom will be very proud of you .
What else do you need ?
They can &apos;t hear you .
Tom asked me for help .
Have you ever driven a car to Boston ?
Tom and I don &apos;t always agree .
Why are you still here ?
What do you do in Boston ?
Tom needs help now .
Are you free tomorrow ?
You know what , Tom , you &apos;re right .
Tom barely speaks to us anymore .
She had to alter her dress by herself .
A house without books is like a room without windows .
How can I get to the train station ?
I don &apos;t have time to sleep .
Tom got in the car .
You had better go to bed now .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
He doesn &apos;t know any better .
Tom loves kids .
He was standing .
All children do not like apples .
Tom can answer that .
I &apos;ll give you anything you want .
I went home because it was late .
Can you help us find Tom ?
Where do these come from ?
He has been busy since this morning .
Tom should &apos;ve been here .
Tom is about to leave .
Who bought you this dress ?
Tom is still somewhere in the building , I think .
They didn &apos;t feel like playing any more .
No one knows why .
I &apos;ve never won anything before .
Tom thinks he &apos;s in love .
Tom was at the library .
It is exactly three o &apos;clock now .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
She looks young , but she &apos;s actually older than you are .
There wasn &apos;t anybody there .
Can you start tomorrow ?
Tom didn &apos;t say when he &apos;d be here .
What do you think I should &apos;ve said ?
She put on her hat .
That building is our school .
I guess you won &apos;t be eating with us .
What are you doing in Boston ?
I never forgot you .
I &apos;ll give it a go .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
I know a lot about it .
I am afraid of dying .
I don &apos;t know what I believe .
Those glasses suit you .
They can &apos;t see you .
That book is small .
You can &apos;t win every time .
I will wait here till he comes .
What was the response ?
That rarely happens .
Tom is still alive .
He likes walking in the park .
Did Tom study French yesterday ?
I ate fish yesterday .
I don &apos;t have to apologize for what I said .
Did that surprise you ?
Tom can drive a car .
You won &apos;t believe what happened .
I &apos;ll drive you to the airport .
We &apos;d better go help Tom .
I &apos;m not buying your story .
I know why you &apos;re doing this .
Tom knows what he wants to say .
I came to Australia to try to find a job .
You don &apos;t want to talk about it at all , do you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
I just remembered there &apos;s something I have to do .
You need to stop pretending that you don &apos;t care .
Most people see only what they want to see .
You let me down .
Tom and Mary are very happy .
What are you reading ?
Just tell me what you know about the problem .
Tom is a good guitarist .
This is the house where I used to live when I was young .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything about himself .
Give it to me , Tom .
What kind of women do you like ?
I &apos;ll cook for you tonight .
I was just going to call you .
It &apos;s hard to believe .
It &apos;s a big one .
They want this .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom gave his dog something to eat .
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy , does he ?
Let Tom sleep .
May I eat another piece of cake ?
Who was that sitting in front of you at the movies ?
He had no difficulty in finding the place .
Don &apos;t feel sorry for Tom .
What else does Tom have ?
You did it all right .
This is Tom &apos;s bicycle .
I think it &apos;s very good .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
What &apos;re you going to say ?
I saw the teacher walk across the street .
Someone gave Tom a car .
How long will you be staying with us ?
He is happy .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave now .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Tom &apos;s party .
The summer is over .
Don &apos;t thank me now .
Let me see .
You &apos;re tired .
Here you are , Tom .
This is how I made it .
They love that song .
His parents expect too much of him .
I need my key .
What do you want me to do ?
I &apos;d leave .
We can help you .
Maybe you don &apos;t want to remember .
What do we know about Tom ?
Who told you that I was sick ?
I want to see more .
You have good reason to be angry .
I made you breakfast .
How often does Tom play tennis ?
Tom is afraid of his father .
Tom isn &apos;t that much older than Mary .
What are we doing today ?
Tom sat down next to me .
He can &apos;t afford to get married .
We &apos;re not going with you .
It was not an accident .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party , but nobody knows why .
That was just plain stupid .
Tell me something that I don &apos;t know .
We &apos;ll go .
Do you want my help or not ?
I didn &apos;t start wearing glasses until I was thirty .
I know this is hard .
Tom reads French quite well , but isn &apos;t able to speak it .
Has Tom found his keys yet ?
You make me feel safe .
All women are the same .
Maybe I should &apos;ve done this sooner .
Tom is not fond of pets .
I need 30 minutes .
Tom can walk .
I &apos;m taller than you .
I hope that Tom will never do that again .
There are still people who cannot read .
I &apos;m dying to see my mother .
I have one of those , too .
It doesn &apos;t fit .
All you have to do is to meet her there .
She knows the truth .
Let &apos;s go by bus .
We &apos;ve become quite fond of one another .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s true .
It almost happened .
What do you think happened here ?
No one can tell .
Tom was in love with Mary .
Just tell me what I need to tell Tom .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even speak to me .
He wondered why she did that .
He has left his family .
Where are the eggs , please ?
To tell the truth , I &apos;ve already seen that movie .
Is that your new girlfriend ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom today .
Tom knows where Mary lives .
There are too many people in this room .
Be quiet and listen to me .
I &apos;m supposed to be here all afternoon .
It &apos;s not new .
I hope to hear from you soon .
She went to the hospital by taxi .
Are you with Tom ?
That girl is Mary .
Where were you born ?
He is not a teacher but a student .
We must deal with this problem .
I don &apos;t know how , but I did it .
You should come over after work .
Look closely .
Allow me to go with you .
Tom wasn &apos;t gaining weight .
Tom , may we speak with you alone , please ?
I don &apos;t care what you want .
I want to know .
I was trying to be funny .
I wish that I could do more .
This bus is going to Boston .
She married him .
Tom was a little disappointed .
What do you think of your own face ?
Tom has told me I need to do that .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father , but her uncle .
This is the best restaurant I know of .
I guess I &apos;d better go .
Can you manage to carry the suitcase by yourself ?
I &apos;d be surprised if they asked me to give a speech .
I have a cat and a dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to eat anything else .
We &apos;re all scared .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
Tom told me to meet him there .
I said I &apos;ll get it .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I only just met Tom .
Tom can &apos;t walk .
I forget who said it .
I &apos;ll need your help .
Give me two minutes .
I think that Tom likes Mary .
What &apos;re you doing in my office ?
He must have seen it .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Are you free this weekend ?
Tom pretended to be angry .
This telephone doesn &apos;t work .
I have written a letter .
I &apos;ve never been in love before .
I just got my hair done .
Tom seems to be very satisfied .
I &apos;m taking it seriously .
Can I help you ?
We should do this again .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like us ?
Tom didn &apos;t deserve to die like that .
He is reading .
We &apos;ve never done it before .
Why does that interest you ?
I wonder why Tom went and did something like that .
I &apos;m very proud of it .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
You may as well stay where you are .
I think you did a great job .
I &apos;m doing well .
I don &apos;t know that .
I tried to get Tom to help Mary .
I should &apos;ve told you everything earlier .
Both his father and mother are dead .
We live here .
He &apos;s found a new love .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom will never have to worry about money .
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
It &apos;s always been like that .
We &apos;ll take this .
Seeing that it is raining , you had better stay home .
How long ago was this ?
It looks like I got here too early .
How could this have happened ?
He often goes with her to watch movies .
I think that helped me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like women .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember where he put his keys .
I need someone to help me .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
She knows where we live .
That &apos;s because you &apos;re a girl .
I guess Tom is sick .
What will we be doing this time next week ?
Don &apos;t do it again .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The paper didn &apos;t carry the story .
I hate it when you &apos;re right .
I need to see you in my office .
Tom sat by the window .
I &apos;d like you to come with me .
We &apos;re new at this .
Tom is a little taller than you are .
When did you start studying French ?
They want to know what &apos;s going on .
How often do you read books ?
Tom has been here for quite a long time .
Say it in French .
You look better in this dress .
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
He is busy writing a letter .
I found it .
Where are you taking us ?
Tom is really handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
I want you to take me to Tom .
I was just looking out the window .
Who listened ?
I can &apos;t imagine that .
I should tell Tom the truth .
I wish I had more time .
You can &apos;t leave yet .
He was foolish enough to believe her .
She loves us .
You didn &apos;t tell me Tom speaks French .
Tom came to Boston to look for a job .
I am leaving at four .
Tom left Mary behind .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
We just want you to be happy .
I want you to want me .
Is everything all right at the office ?
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised that Mary was there .
Where is the problem ?
You &apos;ll like Tom .
You have to help us .
Tom has to be the last one to do that .
Tom made the coffee too strong .
Give it back .
I couldn &apos;t resist doing that .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want coffee ?
Who brought this ?
My book is very heavy .
I suppose you already know that &apos;s my car .
I will tell the woman what I know .
Tom goes to bed at 10 : 30 .
We became best friends .
What language does Tom usually speak ?
They &apos;re not like us .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
That was only a year ago .
What do you guys want ?
Tom invited Mary and her sister to his party .
There are only two days left .
When can I visit you ?
Let &apos;s begin .
May I look at your passport ?
Can we do that ?
Tom knew I was ready .
It &apos;s no concern of mine .
Is she at home ?
You can play outside if you want .
How old is your father ?
They &apos;re waiting for us .
We need your help .
Did Tom try ?
I thought we did a good job .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you .
Allow me to explain .
He worked very hard .
What are you thinking about ?
He stole the money .
Do you want to work here ?
I don &apos;t understand your question .
He is a man of his word .
Where is your school ?
When did you go to work ?
Tom says he met my father .
Who doesn &apos;t like the beach ?
It &apos;s important .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I hope that he will come .
I wasn &apos;t disappointed .
Tom thought about it .
Don &apos;t give me that .
I &apos;ll be there .
He spoke .
I will do anything but this .
What did you do last night ?
I can &apos;t live in this house anymore .
There is no reason why you shouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
She had to take care of her sister .
I don &apos;t want to open the window .
Are we ready for it ?
I think you &apos;re right .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is doing .
Tom and Mary are with John .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk to me .
What did you do today ?
What else did you buy ?
I &apos;m worth more than this .
You may go home now if you like .
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
Open this door .
Tom can &apos;t do everything by himself .
She &apos;s forgotten how to do it .
Go with Tom .
Tom wondered how much Mary weighed .
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
You &apos;re going to like this .
Can I ask you guys something ?
When is a good time for you ?
It &apos;s raining , but I would like to go out .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
I won &apos;t ask you anything else today .
I heard Tom &apos;s voice .
To tell the truth , I &apos;m not your father .
I think I &apos;ll go visit Tom and see how he &apos;s doing .
I won &apos;t lose !
Is she here yet ?
Why do you want to stop here ?
They are going to meet at the hotel tomorrow .
I &apos;m glad you like our house .
I think what you say is true .
How often do you read books ?
Things are getting serious .
I ate way too much .
Tom got injured .
What does that have to do with you ?
I &apos;ve got my hands full here .
Who gave Tom all that money ?
Tom tried to sleep .
We &apos;ve got to find the key .
You certainly have a lot of questions .
Don &apos;t mention it to Tom .
Tom bought Mary a camera .
Tom could have helped me , but he didn &apos;t .
Do you have any children ?
Tom &apos;s talking to himself .
You &apos;ll do whatever I say .
Are you sure you won &apos;t change your mind ?
I should &apos;ve listened to what my mother said .
Tom told Mary to go home .
Tom said he wanted to be alone , and then went up to his room .
Can you play the guitar ?
It is Monday today .
I go to school by bus .
Tom looked into the room .
I know Tom will change .
No matter what I do , she says I can do better .
What &apos;re you up to today ?
He was hard to please .
What &apos;re you doing there ?
Let &apos;s see you do that .
How am I going to get home ?
It isn &apos;t your decision .
Tom needed this .
You &apos;re always around .
Tom felt perfectly content .
Do you want to drink ?
You must tell Tom the truth .
Is Mary your daughter ?
Do you know why Tom came here today ?
Can you help me find it ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait for Tom ?
That &apos;s more like it .
Tom said that Mary was willing to help us do that .
I &apos;ll call .
I don &apos;t understand what you are saying .
You should never have done that .
I have no money in my pocket .
I am well .
I &apos;ll do what needs to be done .
Tom is the one who did this .
I want to know why you don &apos;t like me .
You must do it even if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom kept me waiting for more than 30 minutes .
It &apos;s very cold now .
Where is the newspaper ?
If Tom doesn &apos;t eat this , please give it to Mary .
My horse likes apples .
You &apos;re really funny .
We &apos;re leaving now .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
Your French has gotten much better .
It looks fun . Why don &apos;t we try it ?
Tom wasn &apos;t there .
She is getting on .
This kind of work is very dangerous .
Maybe Tom is in love .
Have you read this book yet ?
I &apos;ll never help you .
Come over !
I &apos;m wondering what to cook for dinner .
I &apos;ll only be staying a few days .
Did you learn that from Tom ?
You know that I don &apos;t like Tom .
Don &apos;t leave the TV on .
Is there a problem I should know about ?
Tom wants to be here .
Tom is too good for Mary .
Where did you work before you started working here ?
Tom lives around here somewhere .
Tom and Mary married when they were young .
I think I understand .
Tom removed his shirt .
We have to leave now .
I always walk .
Tom isn &apos;t busy .
Just be yourself .
You make good money , don &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re not going to tell my parents , are you ?
I went swimming last Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be as busy as Mary is .
You &apos;re new here .
I &apos;ll walk .
It &apos;s all I need .
Tom had to start over again .
My friend has a large family .
Tom , here &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I don &apos;t know where Tom lives .
It is none of your business .
You &apos;re too late .
You aren &apos;t alone .
We &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
What are you looking at ?
I didn &apos;t read the story .
Tom seldom wears a hat .
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
You must tell us .
They haven &apos;t arrived yet .
I opened the windows .
Tom read a lot .
He must have missed the train .
No one was late .
Tom didn &apos;t say whether he would go to Mary &apos;s party or not .
Could you open the window ?
This is not true .
Tom knew exactly where Mary was .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
I know those women .
How did you make it ?
Do you know how to do that ?
That book is worth reading .
Let me carry your suitcase .
They &apos;re small .
Tom pretended to be sleepy .
No one believes me .
They know who you are .
Tom &apos;s story had a happy ending .
How many cats do you have ?
Where are you from ?
Tom wasn &apos;t too tired to study .
Who &apos;s that girl ?
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
This isn &apos;t over yet .
You missed .
Who wants another piece of cake ?
I &apos;m not as stupid as you think I am .
That one &apos;s OK .
I don &apos;t understand what he said .
Take a look at this .
I &apos;ll tell you why I don &apos;t like Tom .
I &apos;ll finish it in two or three minutes .
It is dangerous to swim here .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for you .
I love you more than anything in the world .
Where is her family ?
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
There is a man at the door .
Are you hungry ?
I &apos;ve only spoken to Tom once .
Nobody was helping us .
He asked his teacher for advice .
That sounds like a job for Tom .
If you &apos;d prefer , we can speak French .
Isn &apos;t Tom funny ?
Where are your children now ?
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner .
I need the money .
Tom came to ask us for our help .
What &apos;ll you do this weekend ?
Tom is going to be here .
I gave Tom one of those .
Don &apos;t ask me to choose between you and my children .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t hear you .
Tom seems happy .
That can &apos;t be true .
Is today your birthday ?
She listens to him .
It looks like Tom isn &apos;t at home .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;d love to know everything about you .
We don &apos;t need your money .
We &apos;ll do it this way from now on .
The dog was running toward him .
Tom is dating Mary .
I &apos;m happy and satisfied .
Why don &apos;t we take a look ?
Tom said he &apos;d like to have another cup of coffee .
Tom has money .
She regained consciousness in the hospital .
This is way too dangerous for a child to play with .
Is my French really that bad ?
I couldn &apos;t sleep all night .
You won &apos;t be able to handle this job .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom may go to Boston next week .
What do you want to do with it ?
I &apos;m really fast .
What &apos;s in this box ?
Tom ate something .
This book is easy to read .
My friend asked me if I was feeling all right .
Tom has to go home now .
I know how difficult this must be for you .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
I could do this all day .
Are you both crazy ?
Somebody was in the house .
I understood very well .
Is that what Tom said ?
I want to see that .
Tom did it .
She stood up .
Tom can do it .
I know Tom likes you .
Tom is very good to Mary .
You &apos;d better stay in bed for a few days .
I don &apos;t think we want to know .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to be alone .
I know what both of you are thinking .
How long have you known ?
He worked through the night .
They know we &apos;re here .
Look at the next page .
Tom sat quietly .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
I need time .
How do you plan to go about changing that ?
Tom gets along well with Mary .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
That &apos;s not a nice thing to say .
Tom saw Mary in the park .
Tom comes from a big family .
Tom was told he couldn &apos;t win .
I &apos;m the same age as Tom is .
I was surprised that Tom spoke French so well .
You don &apos;t want to go to Boston , do you ?
Tom can play the piano .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary about John .
This car &apos;s mine .
I want to know your opinion .
He &apos;s often mistaken for a student .
Tom showed me a picture of his family .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
Please don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
Tom is the father .
I was surprised .
It wasn &apos;t expensive .
I can speak French .
It is you who is to blame .
Here he comes .
I have some reading to do .
I have to do it again .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
My uncle gave his car to me .
What kind of job are you looking for ?
What do you think of these people ?
I would like to come to your party .
What &apos;s your name ?
What did that suggest to you ?
I cannot carry this suitcase by myself .
The dog is theirs .
That &apos;s a good idea !
That &apos;s what we do here .
I don &apos;t have a very good dictionary .
Tom was eating .
I hope the weather will hold for another day .
I think you &apos;re nice .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to study .
I believe the choice is clear .
Tom is ill .
Are you angry with Tom ?
It was the truth .
I will do as you say .
He showed me her picture .
His passport was stolen .
Is this your phone ?
I don &apos;t care what people think .
Tom kept driving .
That &apos;s not true either .
I &apos;m busy , too .
He &apos;s big and strong .
I can &apos;t afford it right now .
Tom &apos;s daughter is sick .
He was able to read the book .
Tom just sat around and did nothing .
Tom walks slowly .
What &apos;s stopping us ?
I have almost no money now .
My children are hungry .
Tom looked like he was unafraid .
I will be back soon .
Actually , I &apos;m kind of busy .
I thought it was funny , too .
Give Tom a second chance .
I don &apos;t understand it .
What do you want Tom to do ?
Tom could tell Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
Did you see Tom today ?
I &apos;m not too happy .
Tom told me his father wasn &apos;t home .
I want to read it .
She was hurt in the accident .
Please tell Tom it &apos;s important .
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
You can go if you want to .
&quot; Tom got a new job . &quot; &quot; What kind of job ? &quot;
I called him .
What do you want to drink ?
I don &apos;t need anything .
I know someone who speaks French very well .
The town was deserted .
Tom failed because he didn &apos;t study .
I want to live in a town .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
We now know that &apos;s not true .
Tom had money , a lot of it .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
I &apos;ll do what I want .
Tom has already finished breakfast .
Too many children have died .
Tom lives with his parents .
Do you have a family ?
Tom wanted to leave .
That &apos;s what I want , too .
Will it rain tomorrow ?
Tom is in Boston with his parents .
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday .
The last examination was very difficult .
All we need is a little more time .
I said I &apos;d get it .
I saw Tom in the park .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t get up early .
I think Tom must be hungry .
I want you here .
He &apos;s not at all stupid .
Tom saw something .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that , does he ?
Did Tom find you ?
Are you still angry ?
I have not been sick for the past ten years .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s house .
Did you help Tom ?
Did you tell Tom that ?
Tom can take care of that .
Let me pick up the check .
I want Tom to go home .
Do you study French at school ?
Nobody had ever heard of it .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us that he didn &apos;t know how to swim ?
Somebody saw you .
I refused at first .
Who did you get that from ?
I still have your key .
Did you give it to Tom ?
I &apos;m too old for this .
Make your bed .
You can study here .
Tom isn &apos;t at home now .
Tom has to do this .
Do you know what day it is today ?
Let &apos;s talk over the matter .
Tom got very nervous .
It &apos;s great to see you .
Tom is likely to be hungry when he gets home .
Tom knows how to read people .
Make way , please .
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
If you were in my place , what would you do ?
Can you stay a bit longer ?
It &apos;s this book .
I am joking .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in weeks .
My family &apos;s going to love you .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
I am not busy now .
I don &apos;t want you to do that .
Tom has been avoiding Mary all week .
You made Tom very happy .
What is it , Tom ?
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t been married long .
You can do what you want .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen .
This book is worth reading again and again .
Did you like this book ?
I almost feel sorry for you .
There &apos;s so much I want to show you .
How long will that last ?
Tom and Mary have been here for three hours .
Keep the dog out .
There is one apple on the desk .
Do you have a friend named Tom ?
Tom waited there .
There &apos;s one more thing you need to do .
We still have plenty of time .
Tom put down his coffee and picked up his phone .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll find a way .
I thought Tom was sick .
You love children , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has worked in Australia .
They went to the movies last night .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I made Tom buy it for me .
See you at two this afternoon .
I &apos;ve never seen anybody die .
She knows me .
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
This woman definitely knows that she doesn &apos;t know what she wants .
I didn &apos;t have to open the letter . I knew exactly what it said .
How hot is it where you are ?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom comes here every other day .
Tom and Mary are good friends .
These aren &apos;t my keys .
You can sleep here if you want .
I can &apos;t take my eyes off her .
Tom put his clothes back on .
My clock is two minutes fast .
Do you want Tom to do that for you ?
I just don &apos;t know what to do .
Tom had nothing left to drink .
He told me the truth .
Let Tom go .
We &apos;ll wait here .
Did you forget to buy eggs ?
Tom doesn &apos;t understand why .
I &apos;ve told Tom everything .
I &apos;ve been here before .
How &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
Why doesn &apos;t he come back ?
Tom knows how to drive a car .
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job .
It was so beautiful .
The baby needs its mother .
I don &apos;t like it when people make fun of me .
What will become of me ?
Tom wanted to know more about Mary &apos;s family .
English is not easy for us .
Tom treated Mary to dinner .
We need to win .
I can &apos;t help you with that .
Tom looked at his dog and his dog looked at him .
How is your wife doing ?
What he did was wrong .
Tom tells it like it is .
Tom must not like Mary very much .
What are you doing after work ?
No one likes to do that .
I can &apos;t believe that &apos;s what &apos;s really troubling Tom .
You need to be careful .
I &apos;d love to live in Boston .
She was invited to a party .
Can you believe what he said ?
Everything &apos;s in order here .
Why don &apos;t I have a girlfriend ?
Why don &apos;t you have a look ?
Did Tom make it ?
Look around you .
Breakfast is at half past nine .
What &apos;re they doing ?
Come on , Tom . We &apos;re leaving .
I don &apos;t know what kind of car Tom has .
That &apos;s what Tom wants .
I have no idea why it is so .
The last train has already gone .
What &apos;s a picture like that doing in Tom &apos;s room ?
Tom stopped talking .
I &apos;ll be back in just a few minutes .
Please take one .
Tom can &apos;t afford that .
How could that have happened ?
How silly of me !
Take a walk every day .
I found it funny .
Tom lives in an old building .
Tom sat down on the bed .
Tom didn &apos;t give us any money .
Would you like some more bread ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
It &apos;s all over .
If it &apos;s all right with you , I &apos;d like to stay for a while longer .
You can stay with us .
They like apples .
Tom reads a lot .
I told you I hated that shirt .
I &apos;ll give Tom one more chance .
Tom chickened out .
This problem is beyond me .
Tom is usually drunk by this time of day .
I will hit the sack .
It &apos;s very hot today .
I believe that Tom loves me .
This is not to his liking .
I spent all day thinking about Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I &apos;m here .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; place .
I hope you know it doesn &apos;t really matter all that much .
What do you think Tom would say if he knew we were here ?
He tried again and again , but didn &apos;t succeed .
They &apos;re mad at you .
How many years have you been studying French ?
There was another problem .
Please take good care of yourself .
Are you home ?
Tom made it .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
Tom knows a lot of people .
Everyone but Tom is wearing a hat .
I don &apos;t know anyone like that .
He is angry with you .
Tom , answer the door .
I want you to go there .
Tom has gone for good .
I think I &apos;m putting on weight again .
I &apos;m doing it for Tom .
He spends too much money .
Could you give me a ride ?
Tom opened a beer .
Tom and Mary have come .
Have you heard this story already ?
I don &apos;t remember exactly what Tom said .
There is nothing to do today .
I don &apos;t want you to go to Boston .
Tell Tom to get here early .
I need you to do it yourself .
I was surprised Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
I don &apos;t know how long the party will last .
Why do they do it ?
Can you get something to eat in there ?
I &apos;m nearly ready .
Won &apos;t you have some more tea ?
My friend is seriously injured .
I had a lot of fun at the party .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
I want to hold your hand .
Tom is a very close friend , but he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
When did Tom learn to dance ?
There aren &apos;t any problems .
She came to see me the other day .
It &apos;s my birthday soon .
Tom likes girls .
Would you like me to help you do that ?
I &apos;m going there alone .
I was in the library .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom dance .
What do you think these are ?
They know their stuff .
It looks like snow .
Tom has almost finished doing that .
Tom wants to see you in his office .
I don &apos;t worry about you .
Everything he says is true .
It is expensive to live in Japan .
I was in prison for three years .
Tom will be here for three days .
Let &apos;s not forget the real reason we &apos;re here .
I like it very much .
There it is !
The doctor may have said so .
Tom now lives in Boston .
Do you want your coat back ?
I might be able to help you .
Where are my glasses ?
I &apos;m from the future .
Are you sure Tom is here ?
Tom drove home .
You should leave .
It &apos;s a very good question .
We still need your help .
Tom can dance quite well .
I don &apos;t like either of them .
This book is meant for children .
Tom appears to be sleeping .
You should sleep .
Tom was very good .
What do you think this is for ?
Tom had nothing left to eat .
Tom likes Mary .
My parents have been married for thirty years .
Tom gave me this .
We &apos;re not going to make it , Tom .
My car is parked outside .
It &apos;s his problem , not mine .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that earlier ?
I did what you told me to do .
Those people over there are speaking French .
Why didn &apos;t you get married ?
It &apos;s too good to be true .
Why are people afraid of Tom ?
Tom has already eaten .
Nobody ever found her cat .
It &apos;s better you don &apos;t know .
I know where to find water .
The report turned out to be false .
The school looks like a prison .
He &apos;s not in .
Tom is your friend .
The movie wasn &apos;t as interesting as the book .
I thought that you said you were bad at French .
It &apos;s all your fault .
I was correct .
I keep asking myself that .
Ask around .
It makes all the children happy .
I &apos;d rather have tea instead of coffee .
I haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .
How about a cup of coffee ?
Tom is always hungry .
Your answer doesn &apos;t make sense .
Did you like the movie we watched yesterday ?
She loves children .
Is Tom still here ?
What are these doing here ?
I &apos;ve never seen you so nervous .
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
I am taller .
It &apos;s very new .
My father asked me to open the door .
You should learn French .
I don &apos;t know what I have .
She likes him .
I have something else I want you to do for me .
No one is coming .
Tom might be right .
I speak French to my father and English to my mother .
What &apos;ll Tom do with that ?
Everything was lost .
The train has not arrived yet .
I asked Tom why .
Tom thinks he &apos;s a good person .
Are you sure you &apos;re not busy ?
We are against war .
We can get what we want without your help .
No one here can swim .
Learning languages comes easy to her .
Tom has already begun .
Tom must be from Boston .
Tom and Mary both want to study French .
You need to go to bed again .
You can stay here as long as you want .
We &apos;re going to be rich .
He told us to keep quiet .
It was a very long meeting .
Don &apos;t worry about it . It &apos;s not your problem .
Why is Tom here ?
I &apos;ll explain it to Tom .
I like winter better than summer .
She needs a coat .
I know Tom is your friend .
I &apos;ve made a decision .
What &apos;s your father do ?
This is too difficult for me .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
Aren &apos;t you going to bed ?
It keeps happening .
Tom loves Mary more than I do .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
He had dinner by himself .
Tom is too busy .
He often goes to the library by car .
Why did you decide to speak about that now ?
Neither of them looks happy .
I wonder if he &apos;s at home .
Keep walking .
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him .
Tom could be alone .
You may speak to him .
I can &apos;t help it .
What makes you think I want this ?
That &apos;s absolutely wrong .
Tom went home on foot .
That &apos;s what Tom likes to do .
Any time will suit me .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
I am at school now and I will stay here until 8 o &apos;clock .
I assume there &apos;s somebody somewhere who likes Tom .
Tom says things are going well .
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
What makes you think Tom has never done that ?
You &apos;re afraid of him .
I may have met him somewhere before , but I can &apos;t recall where .
I &apos;ve already eaten lunch .
I would like to see it .
You can count on me .
Is this seat taken ?
We study French .
What do you think is the best way to get to Tom &apos;s house from here ?
We &apos;ll take Tom with us .
Can &apos;t you swim at all ?
Tom can explain the situation .
I hate that .
She was so angry that she could not speak .
Tom may have been there .
I saw the girl swimming in the river .
Tom dropped Mary off at the station .
See you tomorrow .
I met a friend at the airport .
I wanted to dance .
This makes no sense .
Tom has been avoiding Mary all day .
I have no idea .
She pretended not to hear him .
She believes whatever he says .
Tom will never believe that .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
You have to start doing that .
Where are the others ?
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .
Tom saw it .
Tom is a good match for me .
The car ran into a tree .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
It &apos;s too big .
I bought that book for Tom .
He probably won &apos;t come .
I think Tom expected this all along .
What would you have done in my place ?
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married .
It was sunny when we arrived , but rainy when we left .
Why don &apos;t you go to Tom &apos;s ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to answer this question .
How is it at school ?
What else do we have ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about it now .
Do you have kids ?
We tried that yesterday .
Tom really enjoys being a teacher .
How do you like your new school ?
Is there anyone here ?
I know what I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I bought lots of books .
I &apos;m a human being .
I &apos;d like to be on TV someday .
Tom has just come home .
I &apos;m going home .
Tom has asked Mary not to do anything .
He left his keys in the car .
The ball is in your court .
It was that simple .
There will be no school a week from today .
Everything is ready .
Has he arrived already ?
Did you really do that ?
This hat is mine .
I found the film interesting .
I think Tom is sick .
Won &apos;t you come and see me next week ?
Did you see your friends last week ?
You should know that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
Please don &apos;t use French .
I just did it .
Tom has to stay in bed .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with you .
How did you and Tom meet ?
I have to solve this problem .
Tom is married to Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
Did Tom get my message ?
What does Tom look like ?
Tom quickly realized his error .
You &apos;ve just got to try harder .
I &apos;ll be there for you .
I can &apos;t help you with that .
She can ask and answer questions .
I &apos;d like to go to London .
He &apos;s three years older than her .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like dogs .
We &apos;re late .
I can &apos;t help you .
Tom helps anyone who asks him .
I think Tom is going to win .
We &apos;re college students .
Does that make you happy ?
I had fun here .
I &apos;d prefer not to do that today .
I &apos;ll take you home .
We can &apos;t satisfy everyone .
Do you have any food ?
Tom thinks that &apos;s true .
I sat in the car .
Tom still hasn &apos;t found a good job .
I &apos;m doing fine .
Tom couldn &apos;t open the door .
You deserved it .
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not what you want to do .
This is where I went to school .
I thought Tom had stopped dating Mary .
Tom went back to Boston yesterday .
I don &apos;t hate him .
Summer has just begun .
You seem tired . You should go to bed .
Can you please stop singing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary ever again .
Tom was there before anyone else .
I don &apos;t want that .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
How lucky you are !
Did you do it ?
Who were you talking with ?
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
Tell Tom I want to see him .
She never told me she had a cat .
You don &apos;t even know how .
It seems that something has happened .
I went to the hospital yesterday .
I have no idea who it was .
Are you a teacher here or a student ?
I had my watch stolen yesterday .
She says that she is happy .
You remind me of your brother .
My mom doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
Let me say what I think .
I don &apos;t know either of them .
I &apos;ll be free tonight .
I know what Tom &apos;s thinking .
This is not enough .
He is always scared .
They &apos;re in .
Tom is waiting .
I &apos;m surprised you &apos;re still here .
Tom had to wait .
You can &apos;t swim here .
I just saw Tom .
Tom is still living at home with his parents .
Give that to Tom .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you .
Why did you buy flowers ?
That &apos;s all we know for sure .
Did Tom say why Mary isn &apos;t here today ?
Don &apos;t you know who I am ?
He began to sing .
How does this work ?
He was small , but strong .
Just look at Tom .
We will talk about this later .
He &apos;s about the same age as you .
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
You have time .
Tom says he wants to go to Boston .
Tom &apos;s not in his car .
I want much more .
I want you to come home .
I could swim well when I was a boy .
I didn &apos;t mean anything by that .
Add more water .
This isn &apos;t the first time this has happened to me .
That &apos;s where I want to be .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
You don &apos;t seem to be very happy .
She fell from the tree .
Tom opened a window .
I lost .
You hurt him .
I &apos;m sure Tom is fine .
It &apos;s good to have you here .
I didn &apos;t understand any of that .
He would like to come with us to the movie .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
I &apos;d like to be young again .
He still loves her .
Tom couldn &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
She is not as beautiful as she was before .
Why are you undressing ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to be happy .
Did you go and see Tom ?
We &apos;ve got something for you .
Can someone explain this to me ?
Why is it there ?
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened .
You need to tell me the truth .
Did you speak to Tom yesterday ?
What do you want to do with your life ?
I &apos;ve got to find Tom .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Is it the truth ?
I think they &apos;ll understand .
You must show me how it works .
It &apos;s never going to happen .
You &apos;re probably the only person who can help me do that .
I think he won &apos;t come .
Why won &apos;t you listen to me ?
I have nothing left to lose .
Tom didn &apos;t actually ever go on a date with Mary .
I &apos;ve been in Boston since October .
Tom knows what he likes .
He is doing well .
How tall is he ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing here .
Everything he said was right .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t drive so fast . You &apos;re making the baby sick !
I understand .
How far away are we ?
Do you know how busy I &apos;ve been ?
Tom could find Mary &apos;s house easily .
This is the house he was born in .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom that myself .
Tom has more friends than Mary .
I could have helped .
Tom is going to help us tomorrow .
I hope so .
It didn &apos;t work .
Tom &apos;s new book is about Mary .
I had nothing to do with it .
May I ask how old you are ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about it here .
I never thought I &apos;d finish it .
I &apos;m offering you a deal .
I &apos;m still not happy about it .
Please say that once again in French .
He did it as he had been told .
Mary can &apos;t have any more children .
You &apos;re very kind , Tom .
I &apos;d better get to bed soon .
I am going to play tennis .
I &apos;ve come here to help you .
She can hardly speak .
Mary was like a sister to me .
Tom didn &apos;t know exactly what it was that Mary wanted him to do .
Why don &apos;t you go and see ?
I understand this .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t eat that .
Did you get her letter ?
I think we found it .
I &apos;m not angry at you .
She came out of there .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
This is impossible .
What is she like ?
Tom is willing to do almost anything for Mary .
Everything &apos;s fine the way it is .
All the students were there .
Tom is going to like this .
I know how much you love Tom .
I thought I &apos;d go with Tom .
I was absent from school because I was sick .
This dictionary is mine .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything since yesterday .
You &apos;d better tell Tom you &apos;re sorry .
We haven &apos;t come to a decision yet .
If I had money , I could buy it .
There &apos;s something I need to say to you .
Tom will never stop .
I remember writing to her .
Please introduce me to her .
She will come soon .
I wish you could &apos;ve come with us .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
This problem is difficult to solve .
Tom still sometimes studies French .
Did Tom give it to you ?
I walk to school .
I &apos;m not feeling well today .
I really don &apos;t like Tom .
We weren &apos;t at home yesterday .
This wasn &apos;t an easy task .
I don &apos;t like your hat .
That &apos;s how I see it .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
I have only a small garden .
We never go to Boston anymore .
They understand us .
I can &apos;t help you .
Tom didn &apos;t keep Mary waiting too long .
I &apos;ll never be young again .
I can &apos;t believe he did that .
Where did you get to know her ?
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll lose the game .
We know what Tom wants .
I was really scared .
It &apos;s not my car .
Tom missed the last train home .
We help Tom .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
This is how I met your mother .
Do you know where I can find it ?
Who says I &apos;m afraid of Tom ?
He had no money and so could not buy any food .
I seldom speak French anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t stand .
What don &apos;t you have ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have long to live .
Tom won &apos;t care .
My dog is white .
Tom goes to school with my son .
I don &apos;t need a car .
Tom never said that .
Please let me know what you want .
Tom didn &apos;t see it .
I think that we can do that .
You &apos;ll like this .
I like learning ancient languages .
Tom has been dead for three years .
What &apos;re we doing here , Tom ?
He is as tall as her .
Tom pretended that he was a doctor .
Tom helped Mary fix her bicycle .
I heard that he bought a new computer .
He was surprised to learn this .
What made you think Tom hasn &apos;t done that ?
I didn &apos;t believe them .
Tom seems ready .
It &apos;s no secret .
I &apos;m doing what I think is right .
Tom can help us do that next week .
Tom says he knows you .
I think Tom is asleep .
I went to bed a little later than usual .
Is that for me ?
Open this door .
Tom has a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
You are going to be OK .
I &apos;ll write to you as soon as possible .
It &apos;s time you went to bed .
He was quickly recaptured .
You should have learned how to swim when you were young .
I think that I won &apos;t do that .
You didn &apos;t get very far .
Tom is going to like being here .
She needs our help .
Tom has a daughter .
Tom speaks French better than English .
I &apos;m happy to be able to help you .
Tom married young .
Tom , you don &apos;t have to do that .
Tom &apos;s father &apos;s name is John .
I don &apos;t know what to do right now .
Who was it that gave you that ?
I hope Tom isn &apos;t scared .
Tom is visiting family in Australia .
He will write an answer very soon .
It &apos;s as good as finished .
Come and see me whenever it is convenient for you .
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to make of this .
My mother loves music .
Tom turned white .
Tom and Mary started walking .
I &apos;ve said too much .
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
You really should quit smoking .
I &apos;ll go tell Tom .
We have to do this .
Tom had to do it .
This wine is very expensive .
I don &apos;t even know where she is right now .
We both know that &apos;s unlikely to happen .
Tom has been working here for over three years .
People like Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why .
Not all of us are against his idea .
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
Father often helps me with my homework .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
Are you ready ?
Have you done all your homework ?
Is this your bicycle ?
I don &apos;t like it when you &apos;re so busy .
Are you , by any chance , scared of me ?
I don &apos;t want to see you .
No one came .
You &apos;re not allowed to speak French here .
She attempted suicide .
Yesterday , he told me the truth .
I don &apos;t think Tom has ever studied French .
I want a lot .
They just left .
Tom has a daughter about your age .
I &apos;ll make some coffee .
Tom hasn &apos;t been on speaking terms with Mary for years .
I want money .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go swimming with us ?
We have one for you , too .
French is the language of love .
I can do that in less than ten minutes .
This I have to see .
Can we talk alone ?
That &apos;s not my concern .
The river is dangerous .
We &apos;ve found it .
These shoes are hers .
We are not alone .
Where have you been ?
We know each other pretty well .
Tom doesn &apos;t know a thing about me .
Tom is now almost as tall as his father .
No one knows what &apos;s going on .
Did you tell Tom that ?
Give me a glass of milk .
Tom isn &apos;t from Boston .
We &apos;d both really like to go to your party .
I ran home .
I wish that were the case .
I will show you around the city .
I checked outside .
We &apos;ve lost them .
Tom asked me what I needed .
Never ever give up .
He asked after you .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
I must get my watch repaired .
Tom became tired .
Why is it there ?
What &apos;s your name ?
Are you afraid of death ?
They went to the movies last night .
Tom and Mary were very happy together .
The milk has gone bad .
We &apos;re not students .
I said go home .
What &apos;ll you have to drink ?
He likes animals .
He was about to start .
He gave me his word .
They want Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Love is as important to me as money is to her .
Are you saying that this is my fault ?
Are you happy or not ?
Where did he find the money ?
Tom knew that he &apos;d have to tell Mary the truth .
Nothing happened today .
You have to do this now .
Tom and Mary are getting married next week .
Tom said that he was sleepy .
I came yesterday .
Tom is getting good at that .
Have you ever seen snow ?
I was very proud of my son .
That would be nice .
Tom &apos;s elderly .
We must abandon ship .
You aren &apos;t like the other kids .
This question is easy to answer .
&quot; Says who ? &quot; &quot; Says me . &quot;
These are your things .
Tom is lying ill in bed .
What are they drinking ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to want Mary to do that .
That was the plan .
It won &apos;t be as fun as you think .
How &apos;s it going with you and Tom ?
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
Tom wants me to do it .
Tom went swimming with us yesterday .
I am a student of this school .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here long .
I don &apos;t think she can speak French .
Let &apos;s always be friends .
I like to walk in the rain .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see it .
I see you &apos;re doing very well in your business .
I &apos;d like to show this picture of Tom to you .
He gave me a good piece of advice .
There seems to be a mistake .
She writes me every week .
I got up at 4 : 00 , ate some food , then went back to sleep .
I &apos;m very proud of you .
Where did you buy these shoes ?
I love winning .
It &apos;s about time .
I like to make people happy .
I found this book interesting .
Tom and Mary both don &apos;t understand French at all .
I &apos;ll write to you as soon as possible .
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
Tom is waiting for someone .
Mary isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s wife .
She plays tennis with her friends once a week .
I &apos;ll help you all I can .
I kept my mouth shut .
I hurt my foot .
We need to talk .
The girl went to sleep .
I think my mom knows .
Yesterday I was ill .
We &apos;re certain .
That &apos;s none of your business .
Did you phone Tom ?
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
I know you &apos;re right .
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom again .
We &apos;re the problem .
Who speaks French ?
Could you do that tomorrow ?
Tom is about to do that .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
You &apos;ve tried .
You &apos;re interesting .
They are deeply in love .
That happens a lot here .
Tom loves taking trips .
I can &apos;t really be certain that Tom didn &apos;t take the money .
Is this your sack or hers ?
I only want to help you .
Are you still sleepy ?
I came here to make you an offer .
Don &apos;t let Tom help Mary .
Tom would never do such a thing .
It is time I left here .
Tom was surprised by Mary .
If you won &apos;t tell Tom , I will .
What &apos;s for dinner ?
I do not love him anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t have time .
Can you make it on time ?
I really meant what I said .
Tom wasn &apos;t in .
I &apos;m quite strong .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
We don &apos;t know the truth yet .
I &apos;ll see you in Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t doing so well .
We want to have a large family .
Is there a garden in front of the house ?
Everything is ready .
I wonder if Tom found something .
We should &apos;ve taken care of that ourselves .
Are you almost ready ?
Do you have one a little bigger than these ?
Why doesn &apos;t she love me anymore ?
Love lasts .
Tom said he was asked to leave .
Tom and Mary are on their way here now .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I wonder why everybody left so early .
Do you know where Tom is now ?
I hope you don &apos;t mind walking .
Winter is coming soon .
Because my mother is sick , my father will cook today .
I &apos;m all for that .
He likes to talk about himself .
That has nothing to do with this problem .
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
When does Tom walk his dog ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can speak French .
Tom is older than I thought .
Tom won &apos;t object .
Tom became rich overnight .
The bus leaves in about two minutes .
It has Tom &apos;s name on it .
She is her friend .
He &apos;s two years older than me .
That book is familiar to all young children .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom do that ?
Do you really want to go back to Boston ?
They aren &apos;t stupid .
We can open the window .
We saw Tom .
Could we talk about this later ?
Tom knows where Mary is .
What about this dress ?
Tom didn &apos;t help .
Tom felt at home .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
What else did you see ?
I want to live like that .
Her sister I like very much , but her brother I do not like .
Tom pointed at Mary .
I want to dance .
I have to do it myself .
This is my book .
She barely ate her lunch .
I got what she was saying .
Anything could happen in a place like this .
He has already begun .
I haven &apos;t told him anything .
My mother can &apos;t read without glasses .
Tom didn &apos;t come until 2 : 30 .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t even know each other .
I &apos;m not even sure whether Tom will come or not .
Was it fun doing that ?
How much do you like Tom ?
There it is .
I sympathize .
Tom won &apos;t be here tonight .
This is my husband .
They &apos;re afraid of us .
I wish Tom was here with us today .
I do think it &apos;s possible .
Tom has to go .
Do you still have it ?
What else ?
Tom seems lost .
Tom and I both are teachers .
Summer has ended .
It is hardly raining .
How is it made ?
Everyone is ready .
She might come tomorrow .
My cat died yesterday .
Tell me it isn &apos;t true .
They won &apos;t find you .
Her old cat is still alive .
Thanks for your reply .
How do you spell it ?
Why don &apos;t you look for a job ?
After his accident , he is happy to be alive .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary the whole truth .
I wish I were taller .
I think you &apos;re going to like Tom .
Tom is rarely late .
You &apos;re a beautiful woman .
It &apos;s almost time to go to bed .
Where &apos;s my cup ?
It must be Tom .
Tom knows what &apos;s at stake .
Why do I have to do this ?
I &apos;ve lost it .
Whatever you say .
We just need a plan .
It &apos;s still possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is now .
Is that all you want to know ?
I still don &apos;t know yet .
I should tell Tom everything .
Tom told me he felt cold .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting married .
Who was it that gave you that ?
Tom loves you .
I walked to school .
I &apos;m never going to love you .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
Tom wanted to die .
Tom thinks he has found the answer .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in years .
You &apos;ve spoken with Tom since I have , haven &apos;t you ?
I bought her a new car .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
Let &apos;s stay friends forever .
I &apos;ve got a good idea .
He seems to have been ill for a long time .
What does Tom want me to do ?
I was happy .
He was hurt in the accident .
Tom has a car .
Where did she buy a book ?
I know exactly where you are .
Tom is trying too hard .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
It &apos;s been five years since I last saw you .
Tom and Mary gazed into each other &apos;s eyes .
Who wrote this ?
What do you do after work ?
What time do you open ?
Give me your telephone number .
We &apos;re back home .
Tom stood there .
You missed .
This is my last offer .
Have you ever spoken to Tom ?
I &apos;m very good at what I do .
We can talk about this later .
It was to be expected .
Can you do that ?
They don &apos;t have a car .
They want something from us , but I don &apos;t know what .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
Tom and John were in jail together .
Everyone has left except Tom and Mary .
Tom slapped Mary .
Don &apos;t you want to be here ?
No one knows that I like you .
She &apos;s three years older than me .
Eat anything you like .
That &apos;s what you have to do .
It &apos;s entirely my fault .
I just wanted to say thanks .
Tom wanted to know what happened .
Do you want to dance with me ?
It &apos;s not a gift .
They went to the beach .
There &apos;s something I need to tell you before you leave .
What do you want to do with this ?
Tom looks crazy .
Tom didn &apos;t ask Mary to do anything .
I &apos;d like to learn French .
I never asked Tom .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t either .
Tom and Mary meant everything they said .
Where &apos;s your school ?
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
She is lucky .
Tom always eats breakfast here .
You look busy .
Do you really want to talk about that now ?
If he doesn &apos;t come , what will you do then ?
What does he expect ?
Tom is a lot busier this week than he was last week .
I still think that Tom will win .
You can do whatever you want to .
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
You &apos;re stupid .
Do you want to go with Tom ?
Tom &apos;s room was very small .
Maybe we should be quiet .
I can &apos;t meet Tom now .
That was very good .
How many other people are there ?
I &apos;m not going to be afraid anymore .
Suddenly , the light went out .
I &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
I &apos;ve never been this happy before .
Tom told the truth .
I think I &apos;ll be able to fix it .
You can &apos;t imagine how tired I am .
Would you like to go see a movie or something ?
I &apos;m going to school .
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
She cannot play the piano .
Tom might think that we want him to do that .
Do you have any more of these ?
Your watch gains time .
You &apos;re among friends .
Thank you for seeing us .
Now listen carefully .
Do you want to stop ?
When do we arrive ?
School is over now .
I hate Tom now .
It is fun to speak in English .
What does that do ?
It is certain that he will come .
What languages do you know ?
It seems that Tom has been here .
I &apos;ve got money .
Tom is happy with it .
The police are searching for Tom .
They are both good students .
Tom knows what Mary said .
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
I &apos;m important .
I don &apos;t want you to think that I &apos;m not happy with your decision .
It looks like no one &apos;s home .
The little boy has lost the money given to him by his father .
I don &apos;t much feel like working these days .
I cannot possibly do it .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
I &apos;ve never done this in my life .
Don &apos;t be too sure .
Tom deserves it .
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend anymore .
I go there every day .
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
My friend has arrived .
Won &apos;t you tell me ?
There &apos;s something I have to know .
It is something my mother made .
It is impossible to live without water .
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
I &apos;ll phone you every night .
Everybody who was anybody was there .
You deserve to know the truth .
Tom showed us his mother &apos;s picture .
You are wanted on the phone .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom .
He had difficulty in finding his way to the hotel .
I &apos;m coming to Boston in October .
You completely missed my point .
You &apos;d better stop smoking .
I didn &apos;t mind doing that at all .
I &apos;d like you to stop .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gone swimming together in a long time .
How high is it ?
We aren &apos;t going .
I want to know what &apos;s going on here .
Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell .
You may do whatever you want .
There &apos;s something that I want to do before I leave .
Why is fish so expensive ?
Tom seemed fine .
Where is the train ?
You eat too much .
Tom and Mary live in a house by the river .
Are you a student ?
How long are you in town , Tom ?
Just let Tom go .
Tom is as tall as his father .
How did she tell them ?
Tom thought Mary was busy .
These are for you , Tom .
What does your son do ?
I had my watch stolen .
I am good at history .
I think you &apos;re interesting .
You can &apos;t believe anybody .
Tom almost never wears a hat .
You can &apos;t go yet .
Is this your car ?
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
It &apos;s the best book that I &apos;ve ever read .
He taught himself French .
I never give up .
Tom and Mary just don &apos;t hit it off .
Let &apos;s go to the beach .
You &apos;d better get going .
Tom came to see us yesterday .
She cannot have done such a thing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I have a cat .
Tom looks serious .
Tom knows me well .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
I hate Tom &apos;s parents .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
Not everyone likes that book .
They don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
This needs to be done by Monday .
I don &apos;t care , and neither should you .
Did you speak with Tom ?
My boss isn &apos;t satisfied with my report .
Tom admitted that what Mary said was true .
Could you please tell me why ?
I heard that he was very rich .
I want you to be nice to Tom .
I knew it would happen sooner or later .
You can &apos;t let anyone know I said that .
I have to ask you about Tom .
Do you want another one of these ?
I know Tom loves Mary .
I can &apos;t stay long today .
Is she your mom ?
Tom said he &apos;ll do that in a couple of days .
Tom is beginning to look pretty old .
I should &apos;ve known you &apos;d come back .
I don &apos;t like what Tom is doing .
It &apos;s not that far from here .
I can &apos;t tell you the answer to that yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know about it .
The answer to this question is easy .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe him or not .
I have trouble understanding French .
Your hands are cold .
We saw it .
The room was quiet .
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom called me from Boston .
Mary &apos;s baby was three weeks premature .
I go to school with him .
I &apos;m busy today .
I &apos;ll let Tom know you called .
I want to know all about you .
Tom wants Mary to know he likes her a lot .
It &apos;s too late to apologize now .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t care .
You &apos;d better not eat too much .
How do you do this ?
Here we are .
Aren &apos;t you glad that Tom did that ?
Which one is mine ?
Tom spoke French better than I expected .
I can do it .
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school .
I &apos;m sick of fish .
Tom is quite young .
Tom used to do that a lot , but he seldom does anymore .
He is still alive .
Could you tell what he said ?
Tom felt hungry .
Tom is better than me .
I want Tom to come home .
Tom has done more than anyone else .
You know that &apos;s where Tom sits , don &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t go to school last Monday .
Are you able to swim ?
Come and see me .
I know who it was .
Don &apos;t make fun of Tom .
I want to stay here .
Tom kept Mary waiting .
Tell us why you &apos;re here .
I think the same as you .
I see nothing wrong with it .
I study about two hours every day .
Both of my parents can speak French .
Is this good English ?
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow if I can .
When was the last time you went to Boston ?
I can &apos;t put up with it any longer .
He seldom writes to his father .
That &apos;s your seat .
Leave us alone .
Tom says he needs another computer .
Where would you like to go next Monday ?
I &apos;m quite well .
We did everything we could .
She likes all of us .
You ought to know better at your age .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to buy anything else .
I don &apos;t speak French as well as I want to .
Have you read this yet ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary .
Tom was the only guy in the class .
I think this is important .
Tom couldn &apos;t sleep .
I don &apos;t think I know the answer .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re doing .
Tom had no objection .
I know you &apos;re happy .
He speaks two languages besides English .
We just want you to be happy .
Where &apos;s Tom been ?
Where does he come from ?
We can &apos;t start today .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
I &apos;d really rather be alone right now .
I can &apos;t buy a car .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to talk about work .
What did you say ?
I wish that she would stop smoking .
I was at a friend &apos;s house .
I feel good this morning .
Tom wants an apple .
Tom is through .
Tom is very calm .
We don &apos;t have any more bread .
I have to go to the bank .
We know all about you .
What &apos;s the best way to get to the airport from here ?
How many kids do you have ?
I can &apos;t just leave . I have to tell the boss I &apos;m leaving .
Do you have anything further to say ?
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
Fish is expensive .
I don &apos;t know why it happened .
You should not go alone .
We &apos;re going home .
They believe you .
Your house is big .
I let Tom drink some of my beer .
Have you seen this ?
We want to see it .
I will get it for you .
I can &apos;t drive Tom to school today .
Tom seemed tough .
I guess you heard about Tom .
Tom gets up early every morning .
Tom always works a lot .
Tom asked me to open the window .
Why is he here ?
Go away before they see you here .
What I want isn &apos;t tea , but coffee .
I &apos;m not too worried about Tom .
You &apos;re not trying hard enough .
I don &apos;t want Tom to come .
I couldn &apos;t help it .
Tom , you &apos;ve got to talk to Mary .
He &apos;s looking good .
All we can do is to wait for him .
I &apos;m afraid of death .
I wish you &apos;d stop being afraid of me .
Tom still hasn &apos;t eaten dinner .
Go on home .
I did want that to happen .
I don &apos;t know what you want to do .
Tom could help you .
There &apos;s not enough water .
Tom learned how to swim when he was three .
I was in the hospital for a week .
Tom was glad that Mary was home with the children .
I wish I could remember it .
He really needs your help .
I don &apos;t know anything about the future .
Tom and Mary love their children .
Look at it .
Who did you get this from ?
We &apos;ve got to go .
Don &apos;t leave them alone .
Tom is in his room sleeping .
If you &apos;re not quiet , I &apos;m going to ask you to leave .
You &apos;re not good at this .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
You &apos;ve really done a fine job .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
We are all happy to help .
Can I speak to Tom ?
He has been like a father to me .
Everyone was drunk .
What does Tom see in Mary ?
Tom has known Mary ever since they were children .
It &apos;s beautiful .
How did you like it ?
That &apos;s a tall order .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I thought Tom said he didn &apos;t want to get married .
&quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; How am I supposed to know ? &quot;
That play was an immense success .
My uncle has three children .
She is in her hotel now .
Who found him ?
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing .
I didn &apos;t give them anything .
I see something .
Take only one .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
That day shall come .
I wish to go abroad .
I &apos;m not so sure now .
Tom was very happy .
Tom often helps Mary with her homework .
I don &apos;t want someone else . I want you .
What do you want me to tell Tom ?
I do my homework after school .
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
What &apos;s in front of you ?
You might be right .
Tom likes to talk about himself .
What is he like ?
If you don &apos;t want to talk to me , you don &apos;t have to .
I found out where Tom lives .
Power and money are inseparable .
The sun was shining , yet it was cold .
I feel old .
That &apos;s how it was .
I will never change my mind .
Tom will call .
I am ready to die .
I gave Tom no choice .
Tom , I have something to tell you .
He put on his glasses and began to read .
Come with me , Tom .
It &apos;s too difficult for me .
She could read when she was four .
Tom wanted to come with us .
I want you to like me , Tom .
Tom is just like you .
Tom was told he couldn &apos;t win .
My father died four years ago .
The dog walked across the street .
I made a promise .
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
Can you stay for a few days ?
You don &apos;t know my dad , do you ?
Give me the money .
It is not funny at all .
I love Tom so much .
I speak French with Tom and Mary .
Tom left the water running .
I &apos;ll have her come here .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
It is definite that he will go to America .
Is it always like this ?
This is their house .
We met that night .
Tom said he &apos;s going to do that .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
Tom didn &apos;t come on time .
I don &apos;t think that Tom will help us .
Listen to this .
What do you think Tom wants ?
That &apos;s not important .
He likes to talk about himself .
Tom wants his children to learn French .
The dog will not harm you .
What do you have in your bag ?
He took me to school by car .
I know Boston .
We tried for almost an hour .
I didn &apos;t read any books yesterday .
I want to buy a shirt for my sister .
I wonder how this works .
It is said that he is sick .
Tom may do that here .
I want to tell Mary I love her .
Tom found that .
The train doesn &apos;t stop here .
We &apos;ll be busy .
I &apos;m not at all scared .
I like Tom &apos;s voice .
Tom wants to go to Australia .
You should know that &apos;s impossible .
Could you leave us alone ?
Tom did what he wanted to do .
I think you &apos;ll like it too .
I expect that Tom will win .
I think I know where Tom is .
What time do you close ?
I &apos;d like your opinion on this .
I &apos;d like to go to the movies .
I thought Tom had already gone home .
I &apos;m not feeling well .
Tom &apos;s shoes are under his bed .
Tom and I never quite saw eye to eye .
Let Tom go .
What are you going to do with it ?
You don &apos;t seem to be enjoying yourself .
I never want to talk to you again .
I would like to help you .
I can drive a car , but Tom can &apos;t .
Why do you come here ?
Tom may know where Mary is .
Tom had to pay a few more dollars .
I want to see you .
Are those my glasses ?
It can &apos;t be helped .
Tom and I played tennis all day .
He did badly at school .
I want to sleep a little longer .
I &apos;m not sure why they do that .
I &apos;ve made my decision .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the whole story .
Tom helps anyone who asks him for help .
How old is your uncle ?
Are we done ?
Tom came to help .
Tom knows what we need .
Do you have a bicycle ?
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
They say it &apos;s up to you .
He made her his wife .
Where &apos;s the nearest library ?
I think you can help us .
Tom &apos;s not going to be happy .
Did you make it ?
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
I think that &apos;s common knowledge .
Could you please do that for me ?
Tom said that he was going to help .
We lost it .
I don &apos;t go to school by the bus .
I &apos;ve always done that that way .
I want time .
I have nothing to do with this accident .
Why were you looking for Tom ?
Maybe you &apos;re right .
Why don &apos;t you give Tom a chance ?
I wish I knew the answer to this question .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
Tom goes for a walk every morning .
Thank you for asking me .
Please come back at once .
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that has happened .
We don &apos;t want that , do we ?
I &apos;d like to have another cup of coffee .
You should have kept your mouth shut .
They went there .
What kind of work do you like ?
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house .
To tell the truth , we got married last year .
How many people did you see in the park ?
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
Tom couldn &apos;t see anything .
I &apos;m happy for both of you .
They are big .
Tom got angry with me .
It &apos;s been three years since we got married .
I don &apos;t feel like eating now .
I want to know who told Tom that .
I have written a letter .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I wish I had been there with you .
Tom saw a doctor .
I &apos;m looking forward to hearing from you .
Tom knows what we did .
Tom lives with his mother .
Who is Tom talking to ?
I &apos;m talking .
I was never very nice to you , was I ?
Just where do you think you &apos;re going ?
I think Tom will like that .
Has Tom gone ?
I often make mistakes .
Why didn &apos;t you come to the party ?
Tom is shirtless .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
They aren &apos;t alone .
A child needs a mother .
They don &apos;t like Tom .
I want to take Tom with me .
Your things are all here .
Tom opened the door .
He went to America .
I don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom , I owe you an apology .
I &apos;m not so sure anymore .
There you are .
You don &apos;t want to do that , do you ?
I can &apos;t speak French as well as Tom .
He was busy .
That &apos;s OK with me .
How long did you work for Tom ?
The others weren &apos;t so lucky .
What did I miss ?
You need to leave .
This is my father &apos;s .
The man driving the bus is a good friend of mine .
He is opening the window .
Let me see that .
Tom &apos;s luck ran out .
Tom was serious .
Tom came home drunk .
You were there for Tom when he needed you .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
I don &apos;t like it when people make fun of me .
I love you very much .
I want a book .
Did you guys hear that ?
He left his glasses at our place .
Tom &apos;ll go .
Tom &apos;s wife had a baby girl yesterday .
I &apos;d rather not ask Tom to do that .
Somebody was in the house .
Hand it to him .
Walk slowly .
Everybody &apos;s worried .
I can &apos;t talk to anyone else .
Tom definitely wants to do that .
You know why I &apos;m here .
We like Tom .
They were my friends .
I have another idea .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were in love with Tom ?
Tom is old enough to go to school .
Tom was watching TV .
I wish I could go to Japan .
I know her very well .
Do you know how to drive ?
I &apos;m not angry at you .
He had nothing to do with the case .
He is writing a book .
Do you know where he lives ?
Are you angry at him ?
Tom should definitely ask for Mary &apos;s opinion .
What can &apos;t you do ?
Tom takes me to school .
I &apos;m old .
She is wearing a hat .
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
You look like a girl .
I am to meet him there .
No one wants to talk to Tom anymore .
Tom drives very fast .
Tom said something in French .
By the way , how old are you ?
He left the book on the table .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me all day .
I have read that story in some book .
That &apos;s all for today .
Tom isn &apos;t happy .
Aren &apos;t you going to introduce me to your friend ?
She is very fond of flowers .
I &apos;m still hungry .
What are you getting out of this ?
Did you do this on your own ?
Tom wants to go .
Where can I meet Tom ?
You must work .
Tom told me that you &apos;d do that .
I think we &apos;ve got a new problem .
What are you doing in Tom &apos;s car ?
Let me repair it .
I assume that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
Why couldn &apos;t you do that ?
Tom is not very good at French .
It was very hard .
How do you know Tom likes Mary ?
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Boston ?
Are you scared ?
It &apos;s fun to visit old friends .
Where did you buy that dress ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
This winter will probably be very cold .
What don &apos;t you like about school ?
Tom seated himself .
I didn &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
I think I know why .
I am in London .
Everyone &apos;s going .
We &apos;re here .
If it had not been for her help , you would never have done it .
It &apos;s time to get down to business .
I want to try to enjoy this .
I didn &apos;t tell anybody about it .
Don &apos;t make Tom do that .
I &apos;m happy to hear it .
Tom asked Mary if she knew John .
Has Tom spoken to you about me ?
She takes after her mother .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait so long .
Tom told everyone that he was able to speak three languages .
I was foolish enough to believe him .
You must do the work , even if you do not like it .
I was surprised when I saw that .
Where is the station ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three years .
I &apos;ve got to do this .
He waited until she came .
Tom had a job to do .
Give Tom what he needs .
I let Tom in the house .
You never seem to get sick .
You should find somebody else to help you .
He doesn &apos;t know me .
I &apos;ve said too much already .
Do you really want Tom to do this for you ?
How do we know that ?
Why are you leaving so soon ?
It happens all the time .
We &apos;re awake .
We need to know where Tom is now .
Tom is eating an apple .
What else do you have ?
I &apos;ve just talked to Tom .
I know what you &apos;re probably thinking .
What did Tom just tell you ?
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
I think it &apos;s upside down .
I helped him with his homework .
What &apos;s that your wearing ?
What have you been doing this week ?
I was good .
How are things going with Tom ?
What are you thinking ?
My phone doesn &apos;t work .
Tom is good at driving .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
Have you ever seen Tom and Mary dancing together ?
You have to begin as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
My dog is big .
Tom is frightened .
I have neither time nor money .
I am a bit drunk .
Tom couldn &apos;t afford to buy what Mary wanted .
Tom abandoned the plan .
Tom seldom comes to see me .
You should give up smoking .
Tom was looking for something to eat .
Why are the police here ?
Is Tom finished eating ?
What do you think is going on ?
I &apos;m not good at speaking French yet .
Tom was doing that here yesterday .
That &apos;s what you do , isn &apos;t it ?
He is ill .
The new store is going to open next week .
Are you happy ?
Tom does it all the time .
Tom has to go to the bank .
Is this what you want ?
Tom sat across the table from Mary .
I &apos;ll be good to you .
Tom was obviously tired .
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ll have time to finish reading the rest of this book .
What do people usually do in the summer around here ?
It &apos;s pretty clear you have a problem .
His opinion doesn &apos;t count .
How &apos;s the weather ?
I &apos;m doing what I have to .
Tom has been avoiding Mary .
People don &apos;t want to hear that .
He left the room without saying a word .
Tom can &apos;t help us anymore .
Leave now .
I know it &apos;s impossible .
Do you want to know why ?
Tom took a taxi to the station .
You are as tall as I am .
Nothing has to be done .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t tell you that .
I was not a bit tired .
She has been ill for three weeks .
Why don &apos;t we ask his advice ?
Are they busy ?
Are you crazy ?
I have faith in you .
Tom and I are well .
I &apos;m not listening .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants to do .
I don &apos;t want to be different .
He is thirty years old .
How did you get to know Mary ?
What do you think of war ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell us everything .
It was nice talking to you .
I never got an answer from Tom .
Why didn &apos;t she tell me ?
If I don &apos;t do that , then someone else will have to do it .
Do you want my help or not ?
Nobody knows this .
I have no idea how I got here .
You &apos;re absolutely right .
You should listen to your wife .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary to do that .
When was the last time you saw Tom at school ?
Tom used to be pretty good at tennis .
Tom is much taller than Mary .
I &apos;ve got good news and bad news .
I should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here .
Tom works in a bank .
I &apos;m going and that &apos;s that .
Tom can &apos;t stop .
Doing that should be possible .
Everything &apos;s going to be OK .
I should have listened to Tom .
Thanks for that .
I was in the hospital a few days ago .
Tom wanted to buy that book and give it to Mary .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
I think you &apos;re really going to like it .
I &apos;ll do what I need to do .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t make it at that time .
They found it .
How do you feel about it ?
I saw Tom doing it .
What is the matter with your car ?
The other one doesn &apos;t work .
Can I go with you ?
What &apos;re we supposed to do with that ?
My mother carefully opened the door .
You had no reason to do that .
Tom closed the book .
I think your English has improved a lot .
We &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow .
That is going too far .
Get over here .
I didn &apos;t want to tell Tom about this .
I have a new bicycle .
Are you still happy with your new car ?
Everyone looked happy .
There &apos;s a man here that wants to see you .
I spoke to the boy , who seemed to be older than the girl .
I may not do that .
I wish I had a girlfriend .
I &apos;m afraid I have no choice .
What &apos;re you watching ?
Tom isn &apos;t well .
I don &apos;t care what your mother said .
I took the children to school .
What he said turned out to be false .
What do you need ?
It was three hours ago .
Tom has never won anything in his whole life .
I &apos;m not here because of that .
My father has never gotten sick in his life .
How can Tom not understand that ?
Summer is over .
I could never give up meat .
I &apos;m coming for you , Tom .
My watch is five minutes slow .
Here is a letter for you .
We feel bad for them .
I need to sleep now .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom in a long time .
You should learn how to ride a bicycle .
That &apos;s exactly what he said .
If it were not for the sun , we could not live .
Tom stayed in Boston until October .
Tom kept going .
We have enough food now .
This could happen to anybody .
You are not able to swim , are you ?
This is exactly what we want .
The meat has gone bad .
She takes after her mother in every respect .
You should tell him the truth .
Do you allow your children play in the street ?
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to finish her homework so quickly .
Come home with me .
Tell Tom I don &apos;t have his keys .
Tom told Mary he hadn &apos;t seen John in years .
Your bag is on my desk .
We &apos;ll look after Tom .
What do you want to buy ?
I &apos;ll love you forever .
I don &apos;t think you could ever do that by yourself .
I love being with you .
I &apos;ve got to finish this .
Why don &apos;t you go ?
He did it not for me but for himself .
What &apos;s up with you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home now .
Who are you there with ?
I want an answer from you as soon as possible .
Do you want a cup of coffee ?
I &apos;ve never seen Tom drunk before .
That &apos;s exactly what I want .
I got out of the taxi .
How long have you been dating ?
I didn &apos;t know what Tom was reading .
Where do you have to be ?
I don &apos;t know what to do for dinner .
I &apos;m like Tom .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
I study French because I have to .
How far are you going ?
I &apos;m on my way to work now .
There is no one there .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a family .
I can see why you don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom prefers tea to coffee .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet been found .
&quot; She likes music . &quot; &quot; So do I. &quot;
Tom became a little flustered .
This needs to change .
He did nothing wrong .
How much money does Tom make ?
Is Tom a good person ?
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
Are they students ?
There are no problems .
Tom won &apos;t be able to do it by himself , so we need to ask someone to help him .
That boy looks like you .
It &apos;s there now .
Have you seen me dance ?
Tom hardly ate anything .
He has a cat and two dogs .
Tom is still too young to drink beer .
I think they know us .
What do we have to do ?
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
Tom said you were hungry .
She lives in London .
I won again .
If you don &apos;t tell Tom what happened , I will .
Tom is satisfied .
This is the best restaurant that I know .
I think I &apos;d want to know .
I &apos;ve only just begun .
She spoke to him about the matter .
Tom is better off than he was this time last year .
Did Tom say he needed to do that ?
I heard that he &apos;d died .
What happened there ?
I &apos;ve got a message for you .
Tom allowed his dog to run free .
I know who Tom talked to .
I know where Tom is going .
I can hardly hear you .
Business is looking up .
That &apos;s no problem .
Tom can read and write .
Tom really should be in bed .
I assumed you &apos;d want me to pay .
Tom is shirtless .
He still has much to learn .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t there .
Tom looks like a woman .
I couldn &apos;t wait to talk to Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t go home .
It &apos;s up to you .
Tom never left .
Tom isn &apos;t as tired as Mary .
Tom is in love with Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a wife .
People don &apos;t say that anymore .
I don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing this .
Where does Tom want to live ?
There isn &apos;t anyone here but us .
I need people I can rely on .
It &apos;s not what you think .
I assumed that Tom was waiting for Mary .
I thought you &apos;d love it .
She &apos;s eight years old .
Tom found out our secret .
We have very little time .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
I don &apos;t want to see your face ever again .
What happens next ?
I am able to drive a car .
What time do you go home ?
Tom and Mary will take care of John .
I &apos;m as old as Tom .
I didn &apos;t read it all .
You may use his library .
He tried to solve the problem , but had no luck .
He was alone in the house .
I &apos;ll join you later .
Tom will never tell us the truth .
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
When are you coming home again ?
I no longer believe it .
I can &apos;t believe you gave Tom that much money .
This is a picture of my family .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
This isn &apos;t possible without Tom &apos;s help .
I think that it &apos;s true .
We know where Tom is .
Tom sat down again .
Do you not want me here ?
All you do is work .
Would you like for me to make you something to eat ?
Tom is gone .
The reason is very simple .
May I eat a little of it ?
That &apos;s quite a long time .
Close that door .
I told Tom Mary was OK .
He is not my father but my uncle .
Tom didn &apos;t care .
I &apos;m not going to stop .
Do you want a spot of coffee ?
We &apos;ll have a great time .
Tom knows everything .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that happening .
It &apos;s raining outside .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I could &apos;ve met you at the airport .
I don &apos;t think Tom has ever done that by himself .
Is Tom ready ?
They know who they are .
Tom is probably at home .
I won &apos;t help you .
Tom can do it better than me .
He wanted to be rich .
Do you have one ?
I didn &apos;t want you to read that .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I know how to do that .
Tom was asked not to do that again .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom is through doing that .
I told Tom to do that .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
They &apos;ll find Tom .
Mary is Tom &apos;s wife .
He wants to learn how to cook .
I wasn &apos;t there .
Please open the window .
That &apos;s all I know .
I can &apos;t open the door .
You &apos;re welcome to come with us if you want to .
You don &apos;t really know me .
Tom didn &apos;t believe me .
Let us go .
I have already finished this book .
Something &apos;s wrong here .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
You should listen to your wife .
I need to speak with you right away .
I saw her for the last time .
I &apos;d really like to go swimming this afternoon .
Is this your cat ?
I &apos;ve already had a coffee .
Water is very important .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
I &apos;m not married anymore .
It looks like we got ourselves a little problem .
Let &apos;s take the bus .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I guess that you can &apos;t do it .
My father is tall .
She likes to go walking by herself .
I wish I could stay with you .
Is this Tom ?
I don &apos;t like the way he speaks to me .
Tom told me I could use his car .
I hope that helped .
Let &apos;s meet at one o &apos;clock .
What do you want to eat ?
Tom saw her .
She read his letter again and again .
Tom didn &apos;t say a thing .
I &apos;ll show you around the city .
What exactly did you do ?
Tom is telling the truth .
Let &apos;s start here .
Tom is as old as I am .
I said good night to my parents and went to bed .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done that .
I know you &apos;re in love with me .
Is this OK with you ?
What makes us human ?
I think Tom needs me .
I have a job for you .
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
How did you learn to cook so well ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom didn &apos;t know how to swim .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop .
Tom might be able to help you .
I have to finish my homework before dinner .
What was stolen ?
Everybody thinks I &apos;m dead .
Some of my friends are going to the movies tomorrow .
I don &apos;t speak your language .
She is kind .
Tom can &apos;t keep his mouth shut .
What should we do if it rains ?
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
Tom &apos;s listening .
I didn &apos;t see it .
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .
I like to drive .
You can &apos;t please everyone .
Nobody was helping us .
I &apos;ve always done it that way .
You do not look well .
They &apos;ll come looking for you .
Tom is holding a knife .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
That &apos;s my fault .
We are at home today .
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their son .
Even Tom knows that .
Tom would like to visit us tomorrow .
Tom and Mary were happy .
We can &apos;t tow this car .
Let me try it .
We lost it .
Take your time with it .
You should &apos;ve known better .
Why did you write this book ?
Don &apos;t go to Boston .
I want to talk to you about something else .
I don &apos;t know where she lives .
Tom told me you need help .
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
She &apos;s too loud .
We need you .
If you want to be happy , then be happy .
Who did you get that from ?
Tom isn &apos;t a big man .
They &apos;re surprised .
May I call you tomorrow ?
Tom has already gone to bed .
I said I &apos;ll be fine .
We went without him because he wasn &apos;t ready .
Tom found Mary , didn &apos;t he ?
Tom had to go there alone .
Tom thinks he &apos;s a good person .
Tom told Mary to stay at home .
When will you have the report ready ?
I have the key .
You shouldn &apos;t have bought that .
You should eat something .
Tom and Mary are like family .
What do you like to eat for lunch ?
I &apos;ll go even if it rains heavily .
You do your thing , I &apos;ll do mine .
Did your mother make those ?
I should &apos;ve called Tom .
Tom says that he &apos;s tired .
We &apos;ll never do it again .
She has been dead for ten years .
I &apos;ve told you everything I know about Tom .
She devoted herself to him .
Don &apos;t close your eyes .
He is short , but strong .
She is helping him .
I want Tom to read this .
I should &apos;ve handled the situation differently .
I feel stupid .
Tom and Mary plan to have a party next week .
Tom will explain later .
He doesn &apos;t understand you .
Tom didn &apos;t work last Monday .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
Tom wasn &apos;t very sick .
Why is that here ?
I really want to know what &apos;s going on here .
I haven &apos;t played tennis in years .
When are you busy ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to say .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston next week .
I think that there is a man there .
I &apos;m the one with the money .
Is there anything else I should know about Tom ?
It was stupid .
You must not open the door .
I have seen that girl before .
You &apos;re not alone .
We live together .
Nobody &apos;ll ever find us here .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re pleased .
I can &apos;t see anything .
When did you get home ?
Why does that require an apology ?
We &apos;re going to get that .
It took Tom almost three hours to get home .
I just need a little time .
I &apos;d like you to read this book .
We lost .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
He was like a father to me .
What can you give me ?
Tom bought Mary a puppy .
No one likes you .
No one I know knows how to do that .
Everyone has been there .
Tom really scared you , didn &apos;t he ?
Mary has pretty eyes .
Life is difficult .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not that simple .
Tom and Mary are with me .
No one cares about me .
Tom is dead now .
We should &apos;ve done this much sooner .
Tom gave us everything he had .
I &apos;ll let Tom know .
I was surprised to see you here .
Tom has gone to the park .
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
This room is cold .
It &apos;s raining where Tom is .
I often see Tom leave early .
Tom slept in his office .
Is there any milk left ?
He &apos;s the last person I would ask help from , because he is completely unreliable .
Tom wants us to go with him .
We &apos;re pretty proud of ourselves .
I would like that .
Tom had no money left .
I thought I asked you to come alone .
He looks like your brother .
I wish I could speak French half as well as you do .
He has the large room to himself .
I &apos;m sorry I misunderstood you .
He got angry with us .
Tom loves you .
Tom is making dinner .
Don &apos;t say that word .
There is no one here with that name .
I should &apos;ve given you this sooner .
I never expected to meet her in a place like that .
Where did you get your camera repaired ?
I think this is what you &apos;re looking for .
I don &apos;t think I said that .
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
This is it .
I didn &apos;t really want to do that .
I have things I want to do .
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make a mistake again .
He doesn &apos;t need to work .
Are you a teacher ?
I know exactly what needs to be done .
Life without love is just totally pointless .
What does he want to do ?
You &apos;ll have to ask somebody else .
I came here with Tom .
We haven &apos;t heard from Tom in a long time .
I &apos;ve got a job and I don &apos;t want to lose it .
No one was at home .
I was very disappointed at the news .
Where do you think we are ?
It is cold today .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You do like me , don &apos;t you ?
Did you do this on your own ?
I never thought I &apos;d find a woman like you .
I like to be here .
I don &apos;t want to see it .
She gets tired quickly .
I don &apos;t want a horse .
I wish that I could help you .
I have a large family .
I &apos;m coming to Boston .
He isn &apos;t here because he &apos;s ill .
He can be trusted .
How do I get to the station from here ?
I have many books .
If the weather is fine , I &apos;ll go swimming in the river .
I wonder whether or not Tom is as old as Mary .
Tom knows I &apos;m at home .
She plays tennis every day .
Nobody knows the truth .
Why does Tom want to go there ?
How does Tom know ?
I &apos;ll see you when you get here .
It can be repaired .
Tom asked Mary if dinner was ready .
Here &apos;s your lunch .
I went to the beach yesterday .
It works now .
We had nothing to do with it .
Nobody can help you .
Tom seems to have won .
Let me know if you are in need of anything .
Tom left without me .
Tom runs as fast as you .
I went to the police .
Tom and Mary had been married for three years by then .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be at home .
I think Tom can do that .
I need to find someone who can help me .
When does the train leave for Boston ?
Tom was the first to arrive and the last to leave .
Watch what you &apos;re doing !
Tom heard nothing .
I can tell my best friend anything .
Tom disappointed Mary .
I still don &apos;t know why you asked me to be here today .
I didn &apos;t expect to see you at a place like this .
You &apos;re the same age as my son .
I think it &apos;s Tom .
I am older than him .
Today , I &apos;m finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him .
Why do you want this ?
The answer is completely wrong .
Are they your friends ?
You should do that soon .
Is it really you ?
Can you tell me a little about yourself ?
Tom has helped a lot .
It might rain before evening .
Can you drive ?
How was the beach ?
Thank you for the present you gave my son .
This is very kind of you .
I wrote down her phone number .
Tom tried to open the door .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
Let &apos;s do what Tom wishes .
I wrote this song just for you .
Please get whatever you like .
He began a new life .
The story was very interesting .
I don &apos;t know how many years I have left .
I can &apos;t ever go back there again .
Father bought me a new bicycle .
I can &apos;t afford to pay so much .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait that long .
Tom might not be hungry yet .
What &apos;re you saying ?
Tom wants to talk to all of us .
Don &apos;t be like that .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
I &apos;m not going to do that again .
I was told Tom would be here .
I can be there in ten minutes .
Your mother is very young , isn &apos;t she ?
Tom died .
Tom moved out of his parents &apos; place .
I &apos;m not very happy here .
They &apos;ll come looking for Tom .
Tom is too young to do that .
You should &apos;ve been here .
He is not a doctor .
This isn &apos;t safe .
I cannot understand what you say .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
Tom won &apos;t die .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
Please take off your shoes .
That &apos;ll be possible .
I am tired of hearing that .
This has to stop .
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He is nothing but a child .
He had to stay in hospital for a whole week .
I was worried about you all day .
I &apos;ve seen this picture before .
Tell me the truth .
Tom called Mary and asked her if she wanted to go to a movie with him .
Do you know where Tom and his friends went ?
Tom said nothing .
Is your mom home ?
Is Tom ill ?
Get Tom something to drink .
Nobody can understand it .
I used to play alone when I was a child .
Tom wished he had more money .
He &apos;s really quick .
I do that almost every day .
I &apos;m doing fine .
I want to help you .
That could change .
Whatever you say , Tom .
I think about Tom all day .
May I use this ?
I &apos;d prefer not to speak French .
You can &apos;t help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day .
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying .
What do you see in Tom ?
Tom has remarried his first wife .
How do you expect me to do all this alone ?
I forgot about that .
You know something , don &apos;t you ?
This is too short .
Tom is under the bed .
They &apos;ll come looking for you .
I &apos;ll do it , too .
I &apos;m pleased to hear that .
Tom saw Mary running .
I &apos;ll listen to you .
I hope that she will get well soon .
You need to help me .
The day turned out to be fine .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
He is working on the new plan .
Did you talk to Tom about it ?
Tom is taller than I am .
I don &apos;t want to do it like that .
All Tom wants to do is swim .
What do you want to do about it ?
Tom isn &apos;t coming here .
I &apos;m not asking for money .
The idea is not new .
Tom is quite old .
Tom played tennis yesterday .
I had my pocket picked in the train .
Tom saw them .
He opened the door .
Tom wants a dog .
I &apos;ll do it .
Tom is still in bed .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want a girlfriend .
I will come to see you next Sunday .
It &apos;s a good plan .
How did you find Tom ?
I am studying .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to his parents .
Why are you so nice to everyone ?
That &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
This is quite new to me .
What would you do differently ?
I &apos;d like to stay a little longer .
He is good at playing tennis .
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
You &apos;re not telling me anything I haven &apos;t already heard .
Have you had lunch ?
We shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find work in Boston .
What does Tom want with me ?
I heard you talking .
Can you speak French ?
She could solve the problem , and so could I .
What &apos;s that boy &apos;s name ?
Did Tom actually say that ?
He has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
Who does Tom want to go to Boston with ?
Come back home .
I want to read that book .
I still remember his name .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
She tries to read as many books as she can .
I need more money .
We need a car big enough for the whole family .
There was hardly anyone in the room .
You should phone Tom .
I &apos;m not going to the movies tomorrow .
What &apos;s she doing ?
We know that .
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing .
You can wait here .
That goes without saying .
Tom usually eats alone .
Unbelievable !
I have a lot of work to do .
One can &apos;t live without water .
How old is this dog ?
How old is that dog ?
We &apos;ll ask Tom .
I haven &apos;t been sick for the past three years .
Tom is still afraid of Mary .
I can &apos;t go to work today .
Is money important to you ?
The fire went out by itself .
He wanted to buy a book .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
Why are you so good at cooking ?
First of all , I &apos;m very worried about my daughter &apos;s health .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
Tom and I want to see you .
When &apos;s the big day ?
Tom could barely walk .
I think you &apos;ll really enjoy reading this book .
Tom loves to cook .
I &apos;d like to visit Boston again .
Tom called Mary up from the airport .
&quot; I am happy , &quot; she said to herself .
I love it .
I will go even if it rains .
Tom got out of his car .
I take it you haven &apos;t heard about what happened .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom .
I can &apos;t dance either .
What do you think I did ?
Let &apos;s talk soon .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
I know you &apos;re here , Tom .
I thought you said Tom was in Boston .
Could we talk about last night ?
We don &apos;t live here .
Tom was finished .
Do you have a girlfriend now ?
No one would talk about it .
That &apos;s not Tom &apos;s fault .
The work here is fairly simple .
That didn &apos;t used to happen .
You &apos;ve got my computer and I want it back .
Tom is paid to do that , isn &apos;t he ?
You can use this phone .
You should have told it to me sooner .
How do you say that in French ?
That &apos;s not what I had intended to do .
I know Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
I want to speak with Tom .
He doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
He plays tennis very well .
Did they say what happened ?
I don &apos;t know her .
Tom introduced himself to Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
How did you learn French ?
In any case , you don &apos;t need to worry .
We have had a lot of rain this summer .
What does all this have to do with Tom ?
Mary likes you .
You &apos;re not as important as you think you are .
You know too much .
I now view life differently than I used to .
There is no film in this camera .
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
I &apos;ve got Tom &apos;s keys .
Leave that box where it is .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like me .
He is not any taller than I am .
I &apos;m not good at this .
I want to talk to Tom .
I &apos;m often in trouble .
What &apos;s Tom wearing ?
He wants to go to the United States .
I &apos;m not about to stop .
I &apos;m sorry I couldn &apos;t be more helpful .
I could not speak to him .
Tom has to do that before Monday .
Mother often said that she was proud of me .
They were completely surprised .
Tom definitely deserves to be here .
I do feel pretty good .
Tom waited for more than an hour .
Could you please tell me why ?
Tom is no longer alive .
Tom is in Australia .
How &apos;s that possible ?
We &apos;ll talk later .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s decision .
He was listening to music .
You should know that .
You &apos;re paying .
I don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
I &apos;m fine .
Tom writes everything down so he won &apos;t forget it .
Tom spends all his time thinking about Mary .
Don &apos;t let go .
This is our last chance .
How good are they ?
I &apos;m from a big family .
I have never felt better .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
Tom does all his homework at school .
Would you like to dance ?
Why do I even bother ?
They say Tom is gone .
How do I know you ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t believe Mary would do that by herself .
Does it matter to you when we come ?
Do you wanna talk ?
Everybody at school knows your name .
I can &apos;t do this without you , Tom .
I &apos;m a slow learner .
We want to help you .
Please let me in .
Can you help me , please ?
I &apos;ve already told you that .
Leave us alone , please .
Do you have money ?
I won &apos;t assist you .
Look after the cat while I &apos;m away .
How long have Tom and Mary known each other ?
I let the cat out of the house .
I won &apos;t be able to visit you tomorrow because I &apos;ll be busy .
Humans aren &apos;t meant to be alone .
Tom knows some of Mary &apos;s friends .
Tom got better .
I attempted to solve the problem .
She looks happy .
I don &apos;t know how to use it .
What do you want to learn ?
I didn &apos;t have time for that .
There &apos;s nothing here .
Someone must have left the water running .
You &apos;re going to love it .
What are your names ?
You don &apos;t have to do it .
Did you watch the movie ?
Did you find a job ?
I never saw him again .
How did you get into our room ?
Tom , I want to go to sleep .
He never speaks of the accident .
My mother makes the best cakes in the world .
How many times do I have to tell you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been able to go to school for three weeks .
Wait , why are you here ?
There are still people who are unable to read .
Thank you for telling me .
He slept in the car .
That &apos;s your job .
He has nothing to do with it .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be home .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
I wish it would stop raining .
I have to change it .
That &apos;s a good thing .
We know it &apos;s you .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can sing well or not .
I wish things could &apos;ve happened differently .
Tom is very happy .
Tom thinks that it &apos;s going to rain .
Tom says you need my help .
Tom is still married .
I wish I &apos;d studied harder when I was young .
When was the last time I visited you ?
Where were your parents ?
How did you get into my room ?
She has fallen in love with me .
We are with you .
What was Tom doing in your room ?
We didn &apos;t see Tom .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like driving in Boston .
I &apos;ll give you this book .
This is my brother , Tom .
Can &apos;t you help me just a little bit ?
Tom looks very tired .
Do you want me to help you do that ?
I give you my word .
How are we going to do it ?
Tom is going to like doing that .
Come along with us .
She is pigeon-toed .
Tom said that he wanted to learn French .
That &apos;s the house where Tom was born .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
I would rather stay here .
Can you do this without any help ?
I don &apos;t understand you at all .
I won &apos;t be able to help you .
You look fine .
Tom has a message for Mary .
Do you know who wrote this book ?
We had a good deal of rain last summer .
I want him to go there .
That makes me happy .
I knew where to go .
Tom said he read a book about this ship .
How many children do you have ?
Why did you call me ?
How often have you done that ?
Tom talked about his family .
Tom &apos;s office is very different from mine .
Tom barely said a word .
Tom gave us lots to eat .
You know it better than me .
Who will take care of the baby ?
The boy was tired .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
It isn &apos;t a fish .
You can &apos;t lose .
I forgot to ask Tom .
He failed to take the exam .
I hear only you .
I &apos;m still single .
You must do it even if you don &apos;t want to .
I would like to have some more water .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;ll come .
Tom did it just for fun .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s father .
Do you know whose car this is ?
What happened in Boston ?
Tom has been good to me .
Won &apos;t you have some more coffee ?
You &apos;ll find this book very interesting .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
Do you have a daughter ?
I know only this .
Don &apos;t worry about my dog .
Do you want me to put this on the table ?
Tom hurt himself .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
Tom isn &apos;t right .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen the picture yet .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be able to work tomorrow .
I can &apos;t drive a bus .
Tom knows too much .
When did I do that ?
I &apos;ll have to do that .
I &apos;m eating .
Tom abandoned the idea .
Did you eat too much ?
Tom is about as old as Mary is .
I &apos;m coming to your party .
Where are you all going so early in the morning ?
It &apos;s alive .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to take a taxi .
You should probably tell Tom you don &apos;t want to do that .
She has a picture .
I don &apos;t need that .
Tom told me about it in private .
I , too , am a teacher .
It was an accident .
Are you planning on buying a house ?
Tom owns this land .
Father wants to make me a doctor .
I want to know how Tom died .
Can you tell me what is happening ?
Is Tom busy ?
Tom was correct all along .
You should &apos;ve introduced yourself .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t arrived yet .
We want to go .
I wish I didn &apos;t have so many problems .
Tom walked .
I don &apos;t like the house he lives in .
This is my daughter .
I think Tom is happy .
You &apos;re funny .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
The answer is actually quite simple .
I was in Boston almost all summer .
What made Tom do that ?
Is there a telephone anywhere ?
Tom can speak French .
Was it fun to do that ?
You &apos;d better get going .
I saw someone .
This is a present for you .
What do you do in London ?
The dog must be hungry .
I want you to tell me the truth .
It could get complicated .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
I couldn &apos;t keep my mind off of Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t think you &apos;ll win .
He stole money from me .
Tom ate nothing .
Tom is now on vacation .
Why do you think Tom doesn &apos;t like me ?
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend .
Tom and I are about the same height .
I don &apos;t know you .
I &apos;m certain that he &apos;ll come .
Tom waited in front of the house .
You know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks to his kids .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
Tom will remember .
My father often helps me with my homework .
I &apos;ve read both these books .
What do you think of it , Tom ?
They are in favor of your plan .
I &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
Tom wanted to talk with you .
Your glasses fell on the floor .
What can you tell me about that ?
I suppose so .
I &apos;m old enough to be your father .
Tom and Mary need help .
Tom went with Mary to Boston .
I am interested in this story .
You are absolutely right .
I think Tom would tell the truth .
Would you care for more coffee ?
Tom and I were really worried about you .
How late is it ?
Your hair is too long .
I &apos;ll be back late .
Let &apos;s go somewhere quiet so we can talk .
Are these all Tom &apos;s books ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want me .
The lunch is on the table .
What did Tom do wrong ?
What makes you think Tom likes you ?
I made them myself .
He was sitting between Mary and Tom .
Why isn &apos;t Tom playing with us ?
How can you tell Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
Doing that was really easy .
This is a book .
We &apos;re surprised .
I can &apos;t do it right away .
May I eat this bread ?
We want you to do that .
I love this park .
I hate not being able to understand things when people are speaking French .
I asked Tom to explain .
Why should I apologize ?
You can &apos;t buy it anywhere but there .
They went outside .
Tom drives slowly .
Tom got scared .
Tom has started playing the guitar again .
Walk as fast as possible .
No one asked you .
I like languages .
I found it .
I went to the bank .
Where is Boston ?
I have no friend to talk with .
Open your mouth !
I hope I haven &apos;t misspelled your name .
Without a passport , leaving a country is out of the question .
Yesterday I bought a book .
He searched all day for the letter .
When will we go home ?
He said that you had better go .
Tom will come .
Tom ran home .
You can &apos;t leave until we say you can leave .
There has to be a way .
You know what they say about Tom .
Don &apos;t bother to answer this letter .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Where were you three years ago ?
This book belongs to you .
The child ran to his mother .
I &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
We often make mistakes .
I can &apos;t stay silent on this matter .
Let Tom carry it .
It is said that his mother is gravely ill .
I should &apos;ve become a teacher .
I said too much .
I want to buy a new computer .
You &apos;re always busy .
Do you have anything to read ?
Right now , Tom just wants to be left alone .
I have to walk to school .
Tom can sing very well .
I know what I will do .
Who will come with me ?
How are things in Boston ?
What did his wife say ?
What &apos;s happening ?
It didn &apos;t last more than three minutes .
I don &apos;t think I know Tom .
She had only a small sum of money .
What would I do without you ?
It doesn &apos;t matter at all to me .
Tom never married .
I enjoy being with you .
Tom asked to be left alone .
Who said that it would be easy ?
He knows how to speak to children .
It is in the kitchen .
I love him more than anything .
Tom never had to study very much .
Tom asked me to give this to you .
Why is that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like doing that .
Tom wants to live .
Is Tom still up ?
There is a piano in the room .
You &apos;ve disappointed us .
Tom said he needed some more time .
Why doesn &apos;t he eat lunch with me anymore ?
I speak French , too .
The keys were in my bag .
Tom likes playing with my dog .
What did you learn ?
I no longer love you .
They believe in a life after death .
Let Tom live .
I &apos;m going to go with Tom .
You know it doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom made Mary tell him everything .
I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;ll be able to attend tomorrow &apos;s meeting .
It &apos;s not so hot today .
I asked him for his phone number .
You &apos;re not me .
Tom likes to go swimming in the summer .
I want to come .
Did you give Tom something to eat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have much choice .
Have you done this kind of thing before ?
You &apos;re running short of time .
It doesn &apos;t seem possible , does it ?
Tom does like you .
I think Tom and Mary are going to be so happy together .
I have met her before .
I don &apos;t really know why he wrote the book .
Did he go to see Mary ?
He will come soon .
Tom comes to see me almost every day .
We shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
I wonder if I &apos;ll ever get married .
Tom looked pretty tired .
I don &apos;t see you .
I &apos;m not angry with you .
I don &apos;t remember it .
How was Boston ?
You may go .
The children are going to the beach today .
Eating fish is good for your health .
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to see what would happen . &quot;
I don &apos;t like your hat .
Nobody likes her .
Why didn &apos;t you help Tom ?
Do you know what these are ?
I didn &apos;t let them know .
Can you do that again ?
I don &apos;t get along with him .
I always take the bus .
Tom has a room at the hotel near the river .
I have won .
Tom wants to stay .
That &apos;s what makes me happy .
Tom usually skips breakfast .
I think you and he wanna be alone .
It could be Tom .
I know what &apos;s wrong .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for Tom .
Tom always speaks in French .
Tom could get sick .
How old is he ?
What do you think they &apos;ll do ?
You &apos;re not fast enough .
A new love is like a new life .
I didn &apos;t say that .
How does Tom know that ?
Why does that interest you ?
It would be a good idea to try doing that .
We can &apos;t lose .
I &apos;m no longer hungry .
I &apos;d like to change my room .
Tom doesn &apos;t get this .
He likes this guitar .
Please have a seat .
I knew something like this was going to happen .
That &apos;s what I don &apos;t know .
Tom pretended that it didn &apos;t matter to him that Mary was going out with John .
Tom saw Mary waiting .
How is this possible ?
Who &apos;s he ?
Tom and Mary played all afternoon .
Here we are !
Everything was so beautiful .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat .
Let it go , Tom .
I &apos;ve got long hair .
Tell Tom I want to talk to him right away .
Just where do you think you &apos;re going ?
You &apos;re very good .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong .
I will learn .
I &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
Tom appears to know Mary .
I want to be more like Tom .
Tom got drunk last night .
He is my brother , not my father .
I &apos;m sorry if I hurt your feelings .
How is this even possible ?
He took something out of his pocket .
Tom is going to be there .
Tom does what he &apos;s told .
I have to speak with you .
The answer was yes .
Who am I speaking to ?
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That &apos;s not the only problem .
The good news is that we &apos;ll be able to help you .
Tom began to sing .
Tom called me at home .
It isn &apos;t like that .
I know she is sleeping .
I still want to talk to you .
I &apos;m also taking this train .
I started to worry .
You don &apos;t look too happy .
Everything is going too fast .
It &apos;s nice to have friends .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what Tom wants or not .
Are you hurt ?
I thought that Tom had done that for us .
Thanks for doing that for Tom .
I love animals .
Tom wanted to buy it .
It &apos;s your bedtime .
Tom loves you .
You look better in this dress .
I hate losing money .
May I use your phone ?
Anyone can do that .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
I &apos;ll meet you there in an hour .
I &apos;m very busy now .
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
Is this new ?
These shoes are killing me .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do that without Tom &apos;s help .
You worked a lot this week .
If it were not for the sun , we would all die .
I go to the movies once in a while .
I haven &apos;t even told my wife .
I said that .
Maybe I should just stay home .
Leave us alone , please .
I thought Tom loved me .
Tom and Mary are getting married next month .
He &apos;s definitely not coming .
They all look the same .
Tom speaks only French to his parents .
Tom usually eats too quickly .
Someone needs to take care of Tom .
You remember what it was like , don &apos;t you ?
How old is your daughter ?
You &apos;re not coming , are you ?
I &apos;m not in love with you .
It could take hours .
We &apos;ve been spending a lot of time together .
How many were there ?
You can &apos;t go .
The police have been searching for Tom for years .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
I never wanted to leave you , but I had no choice .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was Mary &apos;s boss .
We have to stop it .
I was on a bike .
I hope everything turns out all right .
I &apos;m satisfied .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
We &apos;re very busy .
I have nothing to eat .
What are you sorry about ?
I guess I should &apos;ve stayed home .
A boy like Tom doesn &apos;t deserve a girl like Mary .
I couldn &apos;t stop .
Do you know where it is ?
They won &apos;t find it .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
I have only just begun .
We see what we expect to see .
I &apos;ve been doing this for thirty years .
Tom and I are looking for Mary .
I &apos;ve finished writing the letter .
I know how busy Tom is .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
You came just in time .
It &apos;s a matter of when , not if .
I asked Tom why he did it .
Is that a new shirt ?
I &apos;m not going to do that .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
Do you know how ?
I never get to see you anymore .
I came here to be alone .
She is eight .
Why did Tom do that ?
It was Tom &apos;s idea to try it this way .
Tom can &apos;t buy a car .
What &apos;re you going to do with all that money ?
That &apos;s what they all say .
Tom wants to work in a hospital .
You don &apos;t have to answer those questions .
Let &apos;s go !
Tom came to see you .
Tom went to Boston to study music .
You &apos;re hurting me .
I &apos;m good at problem solving .
His family didn &apos;t have much money .
I was in Boston for almost the entire summer .
Tom and I are good friends .
The boss wants to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary likes him or not .
I &apos;m in Boston now .
This first question is for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the piano .
She begged for something to drink .
It &apos;s not a dog .
That &apos;s your problem .
This dog isn &apos;t mine .
That &apos;s just what Tom needs .
What time is it now ?
Tom went crazy .
Tom should &apos;ve come sooner .
Tom &apos;s helping .
Did you do your work ?
You know enough .
Tom couldn &apos;t make it to Mary &apos;s party .
How can you be so sure ?
I let the cat into my room .
My home is your home .
She tried hard , but she failed .
We will be together forever .
These books are new .
I enjoy studying French .
Tom saw it .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I &apos;m sorry , I forgot to do my homework .
Leave that there .
Why are you doing that ?
Who is your friend ?
I think we need more time .
Tom told me he would go to Boston .
Today you can eat as much as you want .
When did you start learning French ?
He tried to speak French to us .
I attempted to solve the problem .
I have already finished this book .
Tom called me a cab .
That &apos;s a great plan .
I don &apos;t know what Tom is doing .
They understood each other .
I can &apos;t explain that either .
He asked me a question .
I hope it does not rain tomorrow .
She is afraid of cats .
I &apos;m not hungry .
Tom didn &apos;t know what would happen to him .
Tom loves going to movies .
Do you realize what you &apos;re doing ?
I remember you . We met three years ago .
I hate my computer .
Tom and Mary both failed the exam .
How about your place ?
Tom came just as I was leaving .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
Don &apos;t blame the mistake on her .
It is impossible for me to do so .
When will you leave ?
I &apos;m not a baby , you know !
My parents are both from Boston .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I know what Tom would say .
Tom can &apos;t stop it .
We &apos;ll let you know .
What &apos;s your feeling about the idea ?
Tom is taking a couple of days off next week .
Tom got a present from Mary .
What are you going to do ?
It &apos;s not just Tom and Mary that have made mistakes .
I have a problem and I need your advice .
I like your car .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary .
I see you &apos;re at it again .
I don &apos;t want this .
Tom helped out .
What did Tom just tell you ?
I &apos;d like to be friends .
It doesn &apos;t surprise me .
We want to take it .
The food at that restaurant wasn &apos;t all that great .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sister .
What could he mean ?
Tom and Mary both want to go .
I &apos;ll be better tomorrow .
It won &apos;t help you .
There &apos;s not a chance .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
I know how old Tom is .
Your daughter isn &apos;t a girl anymore .
May I ask why ?
You must have made a mistake .
I forgot to give you what Tom gave me to give you .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m not like that .
It &apos;s a new book .
I have food .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll be here .
To tell the truth , I do not like him .
Tom &apos;s name was on the box .
Tom kept looking at Mary .
Do you know anything ?
Are you afraid of Tom ?
Tom knew how important doing that was to me .
Tom bought me a book .
Tom was up late last night studying .
He is taller than his brother .
You &apos;re very good .
The idea isn &apos;t new .
I don &apos;t go to the movies as often as I used to .
We &apos;re running out of time .
For me , it &apos;s important .
Do you have the money ?
Tom wants to tell you about Mary .
You &apos;re like a father to me .
Get ready for school .
You can use my bicycle .
That &apos;s the way the cookie crumbles .
Do you want me to tell you how to do that ?
This is very easy .
I &apos;ve forgotten Tom completely .
What is the bad news ?
Tom has trouble standing still .
Tom may have seen it .
I don &apos;t understand why Tom has to do that .
I got on the horse .
Who saw me ?
I don &apos;t love you .
We &apos;ll get to that .
How did you get the job ?
Who found you ?
Why is Tom learning French ?
Tom will never understand why people don &apos;t like him .
You &apos;d better go home .
You can &apos;t let anyone else know .
I know the reason , but I can &apos;t tell you .
Nothing much is happening yet .
What &apos;ll you drink ?
I might be a few minutes late .
I like this song better than the last one you wrote .
We &apos;ll all go there together .
I think Tom is just a little scared .
Ask Tom .
He goes to school on foot .
You can &apos;t go yet .
I thought so .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
We did that yesterday .
I have very little money .
Tom says he has something to show us .
Doing that made me sick .
The phone doesn &apos;t work right now .
The dog is white .
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
I think we need to go back to Boston .
You have a son named Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Tom felt fine .
He has a little money .
You remind me of Tom .
Tom asked for money .
Your secret will be safe with me .
He can &apos;t buy a car .
I saw you with Tom .
You don &apos;t need to answer that question .
I see Tom .
Why are we studying French ?
You have to make Tom believe you .
Who is he ?
I made tea .
There &apos;s so much I want to say to you .
I &apos;ve got to do something about it .
How well do you know Tom ?
What made you change your mind ?
I knew Tom had something to do with it .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Tom didn &apos;t speak French very well .
Won &apos;t you have another cup of coffee ?
It was a gift .
About how many books do you have ?
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom for quite some time .
A child needs love .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
I have a lot of questions .
I will give you ten minutes to work out this problem .
Tell Tom to wait a moment .
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
Thanks for bringing Tom home .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
You need to apologize .
Can I help you ?
You &apos;ve come too early .
Give this book to Tom .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
What time do you finish school ?
Tom abandoned me .
It is clear that he knows the answer .
Tom is going to do that for you .
What happened then ?
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
Finding an apartment can be difficult .
The girl standing there is Mary .
It &apos;s time for our children to go to bed .
It is a matter of life or death .
Stop doing that , Tom .
We &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
What does Tom &apos;s new car look like ?
This was your idea .
I &apos;m very hungry .
I &apos;m glad I could be of service .
I met Mary yesterday .
Tom lives in Australia .
How could you know this was going to happen ?
Tom said he would try .
He does not get up early .
Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell .
Tom doesn &apos;t think you should do that .
I can &apos;t hear you .
Your story wasn &apos;t interesting .
He was very old .
Tom isn &apos;t alive .
I know where you &apos;re going .
Who &apos;s the man playing the piano ?
That &apos;s important .
Are you awake ?
The sky &apos;s clear today .
You should be a teacher .
Do you think Tom would be willing to show me how to do that ?
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
You don &apos;t need to be afraid .
Tom feels a little sorry for Mary .
I came at about six .
I can &apos;t see everything .
You &apos;re going to have so much fun .
Tom is waiting for Mary .
Can you help me find my daughter ?
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I am watching an old film .
Who asked you to help ?
What does Tom have to do ?
I thought it was true .
What does it look like I &apos;m doing ?
They soon became friends .
When I &apos;ve finished my homework , I &apos;ll go for a swim .
I don &apos;t want to die .
You &apos;ll need more .
I don &apos;t know Tom well , but I know his wife .
Tom said that he really liked me .
He seems ill .
I want to see how Tom lives .
I want to be rich .
We have to stop it .
I was with Tom the night he died .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
I feel good .
What are your plans for today ?
No one seems to know where Tom went .
I &apos;m sure we &apos;d be able to do this if we had Tom &apos;s help .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll ever meet Mary .
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
You know the drill .
Tom was one of three children .
How many people work there ?
I should have done this years ago .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
My parents have been married since before I was born .
This is going too far .
Maybe we should ask someone for help .
The class went wild .
She dropped in at my house yesterday .
Are you sure you want to do that ?
Do you have a child ?
Tom meant it .
Please let me know what you want .
Tom makes more money than Mary .
I did exactly what I said I would do .
Has it occurred to you that Tom might not want to be here ?
You &apos;ve taken everything .
He sometimes ate out with his family .
You are not allowed to leave the room .
How can you eat so much ?
Why are these people here ?
It &apos;s your decision , Tom .
You should never ask a woman how old she is .
Do Tom and Mary know why you &apos;re here ?
Tom always wears a hat .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
We can &apos;t do this without you .
Stop that !
You know what I meant .
I do what I want .
I must buy some milk .
Are you two OK ?
I would rather have a cat than a dog .
You can &apos;t go .
Tom speaks too fast .
Watch carefully .
What do you know about that ?
Tom got up and began pacing .
That girl isn &apos;t able to ride a bicycle .
You don &apos;t know them .
This is the girl that came yesterday .
Who &apos;s paying ?
I can &apos;t do it .
What &apos;ll happen to us now ?
I have three cats .
I heard someone call my name in the crowd .
She gave up smoking .
I &apos;m so sorry .
I &apos;ll fix you some coffee .
Do you want to know what &apos;s wrong ?
I think Tom speaks French well .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
Tom has plenty of time .
We should go .
I think they saw us .
I know Tom &apos;s family .
Can I talk to you privately ?
We &apos;ll see to it .
I don &apos;t care what it is .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
Did you invite Tom to dinner without telling me ?
I didn &apos;t know you cared that much .
Listen to me carefully .
For dinner , we went back to my place .
Your story wasn &apos;t interesting .
It &apos;s seven o &apos;clock .
Tom let Mary play his guitar .
She caught my eye .
Tom said that he did nothing wrong and that it wasn &apos;t his fault .
I can &apos;t believe I just said that .
He &apos;s still at work .
I &apos;d like to go with you , but I &apos;m broke .
I like listening to music .
When do you plan to go ?
He was listening to music in his room .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary his secret .
I &apos;ll stand .
Tom said I &apos;m supposed to be here for Mary .
She is now well enough to work .
Where is the bank ?
That wasn &apos;t funny .
Tom asked a question .
Tom can drive .
I &apos;m sorry about this .
You may have to pay a little more .
This isn &apos;t Australia .
Tom gave some milk to the cat .
Tom was lucky to find his keys .
Don &apos;t you want to swim today ?
That &apos;s where Tom lives .
Everybody makes mistakes .
I cannot cook as well as my mother does .
I &apos;ve had a busy day .
You have to help .
When do you study ?
She lives nearby .
Come on , I &apos;ll give you a ride home .
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him .
The decision has been made .
You know it &apos;ll be fine .
I &apos;m surprised to see you here .
I &apos;m taking off now .
This job pays very well .
That &apos;s the way it is .
I didn &apos;t call .
Maybe Tom can tell you what needs to be done .
It &apos;s not easy for me .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
They won &apos;t hurt you .
How long do you want to stay in Boston ?
That makes sense .
Maybe he will arrive tonight .
I found him the book .
What do you want for that ?
That is her house .
I don &apos;t find any of this interesting .
I think this is a big mistake .
I don &apos;t like men like him .
Tom is still a kid .
I won &apos;t let you go there .
We don &apos;t have to do this .
Tom studied French for many years .
Tom just turned thirty years old .
Tom was almost as surprised as Mary .
Tom knew that this would happen .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
She wasn &apos;t able to talk to him .
I &apos;ve learned to think like Tom thinks .
I got to know her through one of my friends .
I don &apos;t know who made the cake .
Tom is not like that all the time .
I can &apos;t say exactly .
I want that car .
It is difficult to solve this problem .
Look what they &apos;re doing .
Tom wants to know what Mary did last weekend .
Tom didn &apos;t say a word to me .
Can you really not swim ?
Tom read about Mary &apos;s accident in the newspaper .
That happens sometimes .
You need to try a little harder .
He may be sick in bed .
I want to go to Boston with Tom .
I don &apos;t know . What do you think ?
I really like him .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
Her story was not interesting .
I want you to make me a promise .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along very well .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
Someone has left a bag on the bench .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
How many times do you think you &apos;ve eaten here ?
I received your message yesterday .
She has a book .
They &apos;re after you .
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m right .
Has anybody come ?
You don &apos;t look happy to see me .
We &apos;re getting fewer and fewer students .
Why is Tom going to Boston ?
They were right .
That &apos;s all she wrote .
Tom often helps Mary with her homework .
I only just left Tom .
I &apos;d forgotten how much I liked Tom .
Tom knows how to make money .
They &apos;re home .
Why do you do that ?
Who is that man ?
Tom called .
Come at once .
I love doing this .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Why isn &apos;t anybody doing anything ?
Did you play tennis yesterday ?
That &apos;s all I need .
I believe I have now told you everything .
You won &apos;t get rid of me that easily .
I think you went too far .
You are tired , and so am I .
I think those are Tom &apos;s books .
You shouldn &apos;t leave the baby alone .
I &apos;m glad to see that you &apos;re happy .
You aren &apos;t rich , are you ?
Do you have money ?
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
I was hungry .
He understands French .
Tom wanted this .
I wish I &apos;d thought of that .
Tom has enough money to buy what he wants .
They don &apos;t know us .
Let &apos;s forget about this .
The whole class was quiet .
There &apos;s got to be something you can do .
Finish it before you go to bed .
I don &apos;t have a family .
I can carry that .
I don &apos;t have to do that .
That is a very good question .
I want to ask you something .
Tom said his job was a lot of fun .
What are you going to have ?
She doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
That &apos;s for sure .
Tom wants to become a doctor .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
That &apos;s not Tom . That &apos;s John .
Tom waited for Mary until 2 : 30 .
Listen closely .
Who was right ?
I go to the movies once in a while .
I don &apos;t care what you do with it .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
How many times have I asked you to not do that ?
Tom likes learning French .
Tom told me he speaks French .
I hurt my foot getting in the automobile .
I hear you &apos;re moving to Australia .
Take mine .
Why are they doing this to me ?
Not all children like apples .
You had better not speak loudly in this room .
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
I do a lot of worrying .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
These are very big apples .
This plane is his .
You don &apos;t look so good .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve met Tom .
It is beyond my power .
Did you find a doctor ?
Let Tom do anything he wants .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
All the girls love Tom .
I &apos;m going to do it .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet , have they ?
I like your shirt .
Tom can &apos;t cook very well .
Why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry ?
Your French is good enough .
Why didn &apos;t you bring your hat today ?
I don &apos;t think Tom would try to do that without our help .
I don &apos;t like apples .
I &apos;m sorry that I haven &apos;t been able to be here for you like I should have been .
They don &apos;t want us here .
Where &apos;s the girl ?
Tom and Mary want to learn French .
I don &apos;t plan to meet Tom until tomorrow .
It &apos;s been three years since my father died .
She did not come until two .
Tom left school an hour ago .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to Australia next week .
Is it important ?
What do you mean by it ?
Tom was surprised to hear Mary had gotten married .
Would you like more coffee ?
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
How are things with you and Tom ?
I heard you talking to Tom .
Tom hasn &apos;t done what he was supposed to do .
He wants a new car .
Tom became nervous .
Tom tries .
He did what he had been told .
Do you know where my glasses are ?
We had better not remain here any longer .
Tom is older than Mary .
I &apos;m worried about Tom .
I &apos;m healthy .
If you &apos;re happy , I &apos;m happy .
You must not do that anymore .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about it .
I take my job seriously .
I &apos;m only going to say this once .
I got here as soon as I heard you needed me .
He broke into a house .
I did what I was told .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
You have made it .
They have nothing to eat .
Tom said he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
He wants a watch just like yours .
The young boy helped the old woman .
Tom speaks three languages .
Tom wouldn &apos;t know .
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
I want you to drive to Boston .
I know Tom likes Mary .
Did you see anybody there ?
Tom turned serious .
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth .
What &apos;s Tom up to in Boston ?
He had barely enough to eat .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Tom wants to be happy again .
That &apos;s what brought us together .
I can &apos;t explain that .
Would you like me to show you how to do that ?
Let us out .
She has flowers in her hand .
He seems to have left the country .
Can I say something now ?
Tom is quite handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
Did you complete the work ?
We &apos;ll be leaving now .
Tom can &apos;t have done it .
Tom seems to know a lot about me .
Why are you going ?
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this ?
Do you want me to go now ?
Did you pay for the book ?
I know what you &apos;re saying .
Tom hasn &apos;t written the letter yet .
My father has a restaurant .
I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s right or not .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me anything about you .
I want to be with my family .
How many people are at this party ?
Tom left three days ago .
I don &apos;t really want to do that .
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
Their hands were cold .
I thought he would come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to wait for Mary .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
It might be fun .
I won &apos;t forget .
Tom was tempted to tell Mary the truth .
If I were you , I &apos;d start immediately .
It &apos;s yours .
Everything I said was true .
Go back to your seat .
Are you planning on buying a car ?
Didn &apos;t you like the movie ?
Tom , I &apos;m home .
I &apos;ll never see him again .
I met her in the winter three years ago .
Do you like it or not ?
How long have you guys known each other ?
He intended to marry her .
Tom did it for fun .
Give it to her .
It &apos;s yours for the asking , Tom .
Maybe he was ill .
I &apos;d like to be alone .
We have no idea how it happened .
Tom bought a camera for Mary .
Are you able to speak French ?
Is that coffee ?
Don &apos;t be so angry .
It &apos;s part of life .
I &apos;m making breakfast now .
What time can you come ?
Could I have a word with you in private ?
We don &apos;t live here .
I need Tom now .
I know how busy you are .
Tom is going to explain it to all of us .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
This baby is 3 weeks old .
Tom wants to learn how to ride a bike .
I really don &apos;t feel like talking to Tom right now .
You &apos;re not allowed to leave this room .
We need more time .
I think you like me .
I just saw Tom and Mary together .
You &apos;d better not go there .
Tom keeps his word .
Tom knows who Mary is .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
They will come .
We must finish our homework first .
I received your letter yesterday .
I already told you everything I know .
How did Tom find us ?
I could show you around the city .
You &apos;re completely right .
I called Tom up .
May I ask you some more questions ?
Tom hardly ever talks about his work .
I should &apos;ve told Tom .
I wasn &apos;t making fun of you .
Are you free this afternoon ?
Can you swim at all ?
You cannot do this .
I have a question for you .
There &apos;s nobody in your room .
Tom likes it when I do that .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll like that .
Is he correct ?
I &apos;m so sorry .
You can &apos;t leave yet , Tom .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother .
I am short of money .
Anybody who wants to leave early may do so .
Why did you invite Tom to the party ?
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t know how to speak French .
When did it first start to happen ?
We &apos;re going to Boston .
English is not spoken here .
I wish I had been with her then .
She forgot to write him .
Do you want to know the truth ?
When will you ever learn ?
What do you have for me today ?
I don &apos;t have enough money yet .
Did Tom work for you ?
Tom is hardly ever at home .
Would you like to drink anything ?
Tom kept quiet .
He took off his clothes .
Where &apos;s my phone ?
I &apos;ll tell you right now that Tom won &apos;t know the answer .
That &apos;s not what I wanted hear .
I think we &apos;re safe now .
I &apos;m not doing that .
I know who lives in this house .
Beat it .
Is Tom married ?
We can do a lot better than this .
I will make a man out of you .
What did Tom actually do ?
Tom just started .
Here is my phone number .
I don &apos;t know how to say it .
I &apos;ll go back to Boston .
The problem is that we don &apos;t know where Tom is .
Tom wouldn &apos;t want that .
That girl looks like a boy .
Have you eaten dinner ?
I think Tom would have liked that .
Tom wasn &apos;t very good .
He wrote to his parents .
I don &apos;t understand you .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom is my student .
You worked more than I did .
It may not come to that .
You shouldn &apos;t talk here .
It &apos;s your decision .
Tom said he never saw Mary .
Tom did a really nice job .
Do you have a plan ?
We want to talk to Tom .
We &apos;re here because of you .
How long do I have to wait ?
Here comes a bus . We might as well take it .
I want to come home .
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
I just met her on the street .
This is not my car .
I &apos;m now married .
We have been good friends for ten years .
Tom opened his mouth .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t hear you well .
They want to get married .
Tom was able to help Mary .
You always say that .
The truth is that I can &apos;t speak French at all .
I must &apos;ve misunderstood .
I want to go home and sleep .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong .
Tom was still in the classroom when I left .
Tom doesn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
Tom should &apos;ve danced with Mary .
How much money do you have on you ?
A woman asked me for directions .
Tom stayed at home alone .
I don &apos;t know anything about Japan .
This room has three windows .
It &apos;s all I have .
Tom is worried about his future .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve always said .
Look at the girls .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that woman .
Don &apos;t tell me what to eat .
Tom just kept eating .
There are people here who need your help .
He can speak only a little English .
You wouldn &apos;t have won without me .
How old are your children now ?
I used to live near here .
You did what had to be done .
We like it .
Why don &apos;t you just do it ?
This is not going to end well .
You should know yourself .
What &apos;s Tom saying ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to eat for dinner .
My children are in school .
Who is that boy ?
That apple is big .
I don &apos;t need a suitcase that big .
He told everyone .
What Tom did was crazy .
Don &apos;t give this to anybody .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that .
She has an uncle who works in a bank .
I don &apos;t want to stop .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
I only have two children .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell Tom .
Tom just doesn &apos;t want to hear this .
I almost always walk to work .
Tom and Mary were both busy .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still hungry .
Nobody knows the future .
You ought to listen to your mother .
Is he still interested ?
When I was your age , I bicycled to and from school every day .
She can speak not only English but also French .
Tom is as old as Mary .
Can you swim at all ?
This book is very small .
I learned today that Tom doesn &apos;t like me . Do you know why ?
We can &apos;t live like this .
I &apos;ve already discussed it with Tom .
I &apos;m very sorry .
Tom rarely makes mistakes .
I am accustomed to working hard .
Don &apos;t go there .
How about a cup of coffee ?
I am tired of my work .
I &apos;m tired of Boston .
Tom has some advice for us .
Tom is up .
You don &apos;t need to answer that question .
Are you still there ?
Tom is no longer amused .
Everyone in my family can sing fairly well .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his brother .
My uncle comes to see me from time to time .
I can &apos;t leave Tom behind .
Thanks for dropping by .
He came back after two days .
We have been here for three weeks .
I have to use the dictionary .
I shouldn &apos;t have told you this .
How long have you worked for us ?
I &apos;m taking off .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t study .
Where are you now ?
Tom said that Mary was very drunk .
Is there something that you want to tell me ?
I &apos;ve been here for three years .
Tom said that he thought he &apos;d be able to do that today .
What is it that we have to do ?
Where did you learn French ?
Tom stepped off the train .
Where does your uncle live ?
The fire started in Tom &apos;s room .
Tom will drive you home .
She prefers beer to wine .
I think Tom understood that .
I don &apos;t have a key .
What do you really think ?
I &apos;ll do that later .
We won &apos;t be going to Tom &apos;s party .
I am seeing a friend tomorrow .
I want to get as far away from here as I can .
I gave it to the little boy .
Nobody &apos;s seen Tom .
Do you really not know ?
You did what had to be done .
Do you have it with you ?
You should &apos;ve told the truth .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to pay anything ?
Tom didn &apos;t wait .
Do you want him ?
I had to have Tom rewrite the report .
It sure is cold today .
You have friends here .
I don &apos;t care what you say .
I gave it to the little boy .
I wish I could help you .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
I think you &apos;d better leave now .
Why do you know so much about Australia ?
I think Tom knows already .
Do you have a dog ?
You will need time to understand .
What do they do ?
I arrived three days ago .
Is today your birthday ?
What makes you happy , Tom ?
I get it .
It was Tom &apos;s .
We need to speak with you .
Tom has never been in love .
Tom wanted to be a doctor .
Your name &apos;s not Tom , is it ?
How did he find us ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe us .
My brother is living in Boston .
The hat is yours .
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
I seldom hear from him .
Tom wants to take a day off .
We helped Tom the best we could .
I asked Tom to speak French .
It &apos;s a good thing I came here .
Tom didn &apos;t anticipate that would happen .
Tom asked a few good questions .
Tom said something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
Here , take this .
Tom knows some French .
I can &apos;t read .
The food was so good that I ate too much .
Did they live here ?
I &apos;ve seen the picture before .
I can &apos;t remember anyone &apos;s name .
That &apos;s what you think .
You were never alone .
Tom says he can &apos;t find his hat .
She loves Tom , not me .
What kind of girl are you ?
That was serious .
Tom looked fine .
Don &apos;t leave your glasses on the table .
I tried to tell you .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
Tom is fun to play with .
I cannot get in touch with him .
I have the day off .
Tom wants to quit .
Can your wife speak French ?
Tom is in your car .
I think you &apos;re in danger .
This is hers .
I thought I &apos;d go with you .
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
Did you go to see a doctor ?
He left after me .
Tom said he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself .
Ask again later .
I &apos;m going to sleep on it .
He asked me whether I was busy .
I love you the way you are .
What will happen to her ?
How &apos;s your day going ?
Are you good at French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak much French .
I don &apos;t think I like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come with us .
We want to live here .
I asked him his name .
I don &apos;t have to worry about money .
I don &apos;t like people like Tom .
It is time to go to bed .
I know his name isn &apos;t Tom .
Where are they taking you ?
She can &apos;t do that .
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
Tom wants to play .
I &apos;m going to Boston with you .
When was the last time you got drunk ?
No one understands you like I do .
Summer has ended .
I would like to ask two questions .
Do you have any idea why Tom gave it to you ?
Where is this money coming from ?
I want to be here for Tom .
Tom can &apos;t swim .
Yesterday , Tom told me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
The decision has already been made .
Tom ate an early supper .
Did you come by car ?
I want to know more about your country .
I want you to come home with me .
Did that accident really happen last year ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like girls like Mary .
I like to do that .
Tom has fallen in love with me .
There &apos;s no reason for you to apologize .
Did Tom come ?
We &apos;re available .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be gone long .
He will be here any moment .
This isn &apos;t about money .
I talk to myself all the time .
Come with me .
I &apos;m supposed to go to Boston on Monday .
We &apos;ve got to talk .
Is her father a teacher ?
I don &apos;t want to leave Tom .
A lot of students around the world are studying English .
Tom knows the secret .
You know this is a mistake .
Are you sure that you want to do this ?
Tom got hurt in the game last week .
I &apos;ve met you before .
Tom isn &apos;t funny .
Where is your brother ?
Tom seems unusual .
You know too much .
Could you please say that once again in French ?
Do you have any more of these ?
What does Tom want ?
They must be dead .
There &apos;s no one there .
It made me forget about my problems .
What happened in the park ?
Are you absolutely sure ?
Tom said he &apos;d wait .
He is bigger than all the other boys .
Tom isn &apos;t stupid .
Tom sat down next to his daughter .
I think that you ought to apologize to her .
A few days later , he came .
She paid me a visit yesterday .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
When did your family arrive in Boston ?
What do you mean by it ?
My father bought me this hat .
What are you guys doing ?
I wish it was that easy .
Tom is coming here , isn &apos;t he ?
How lovely !
I don &apos;t love you anymore .
Tom needs that money .
I know what they &apos;re going to do .
It starts around 8 : 30 .
Tom is thirtyish .
Everybody knows she can speak English well .
You should &apos;ve listened to me .
Thank you for coming .
That house is big .
What are you people doing ?
Tom told me that I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary .
Tom knows my wife .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
Dinner is ready , Father .
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Why did you help me ?
Why do you want to know what I &apos;m thinking ?
Can I help ?
No one &apos;s here .
Tom helped .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary for a long time .
Everything is expensive in London .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t my friend anymore .
I think Tom said that .
I tried to help .
We &apos;ll take it .
I have to go to work .
How do you know ?
Cats are afraid of water .
Tom will start .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
He doesn &apos;t know what to do with his money .
She can speak French .
Tom is standing .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Tom knew too much .
That &apos;s our secret .
Use this .
Tom was abroad .
I like to learn new things .
Nobody must know .
I know Tom better than anybody else does .
I needed more money .
I still have your key .
We can &apos;t help you .
I can &apos;t explain it now .
It &apos;s merely a joke .
Tom goes to school on foot .
I can &apos;t see anything without my glasses .
We haven &apos;t done a thing all week .
He eats a lot .
I just can &apos;t help .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d do that .
What do they know that we don &apos;t ?
Why did you say that to Tom ?
She went to the park with him .
Tom is at home with Mary .
He is able to speak ten languages .
Tom won &apos;t like that answer .
Why isn &apos;t it good ?
America is very large .
What &apos;re you doing in my office ?
I believe we &apos;ve seen enough .
I don &apos;t have the money .
This doesn &apos;t make a whole lot of sense .
I &apos;m game .
Tom took out his knife .
Do you have any water ?
Tom seldom writes to his parents .
You know what you must do .
Don &apos;t play in this room .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this .
Please come again .
Tom lost his voice .
He still loves her .
Are you surprised that I came ?
It could happen to anybody .
As you like .
I really enjoy coming here .
I have to give this book to Tom .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let me leave .
You haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
Tom had almost forgotten all about what had happened .
There was nobody there .
When did you start studying English ?
Tom yelled for help .
I &apos;d almost forgotten .
I &apos;m always careful .
I &apos;ll be right with you .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find a job .
This is one of the best schools in the city .
What is it you &apos;d like me to do exactly ?
How is your dad ?
Is that what you want to do ?
What &apos;re you going to do ?
I probably should have said something .
How hot is too hot ?
How beautiful !
The water is hot .
I asked Tom to help .
Please wait for me at the station .
Are you tired ?
Tom wanted to get married , but Mary didn &apos;t .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
I &apos;m happy , very happy .
Tom is almost as tall as me .
What did Tom do yesterday afternoon ?
Tom listens to Mary .
Have you ever taken your children to the beach ?
I &apos;d like to shake Tom &apos;s hand .
We can rely on Tom .
Tom no longer works here .
Why don &apos;t you watch TV ?
What &apos;s today &apos;s plan ?
Tom slammed the door .
I like walking at night .
You should go see a doctor .
What was Tom doing in Australia last month ?
I need to talk to you .
How long were you in Boston ?
I think his name is Tom .
My father will help me .
What do you say to a beer ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Can you see that ?
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
What do you think of this plan ?
This hat is too small for me .
That room is not very large .
I wish I were young .
I love going to the beach .
I know that Tom is married .
Tom earned money .
You shouldn &apos;t wait any longer .
My father is still ill in bed .
What else would you like to know ?
I don &apos;t go swimming as often as I used to .
Tom is only a couple of years older than me .
This box is heavy .
They &apos;re going to try .
They really did it .
Please let us know .
Are you happy , Tom ?
I &apos;m not here to help you .
Take that back .
Tom turned up three hours late .
Why are you not doing it ?
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
I &apos;ve always been here .
I &apos;m willing to give it a try .
I don &apos;t really want to live in Boston .
Tom did that a lot .
She met him for breakfast .
I &apos;ve been telling you that for years .
I plan to contact Tom by phone tomorrow and ask him to help us .
They &apos;re not coming .
I don &apos;t remember anymore .
Tom stood in front of me .
Tom is glad .
Tom told Mary that he was busy .
Why do you ask that ?
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital ?
I have no idea what the weather will be like tomorrow .
Where does the airport bus leave from ?
You &apos;d better not stay up too late .
I enjoyed talking to him .
Tom and Mary are both students .
I came for Tom .
How much did you win ?
I didn &apos;t want Tom at my party .
That isn &apos;t my problem .
All of them will get a prize .
He died five years ago .
Leave the food on the table .
Tom says he can fix anything .
The night &apos;s still young .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can live without him .
Tom loves us .
Can all your children speak French ?
There is nothing in this world that I am afraid of .
I &apos;m sure that I can handle it .
What do you really think ?
Do you two want to be alone ?
Why is she so silent ?
Go and ask Tom .
That &apos;s common knowledge .
Did you really steal this food ?
Tom has been absent from school for three days .
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
I &apos;ve never done it like that before .
Do you want to know his name ?
Tom got in the car with Mary .
I am happy to spend money on books .
Everybody knows who you are .
I learned that from you .
Tom gave me his phone number .
How do you want to do this ?
We don &apos;t want to do this .
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
He writes to his parents once a month .
Tom and I often work together .
Tom has already eaten lunch .
You &apos;ll like it .
I can &apos;t tell what it is .
We &apos;re not exactly sure what it was .
I love that dress .
This was a big mistake .
They have many students .
Tom has to stay .
I &apos;ll be going to Boston next week , but I &apos;m not really looking forward to it .
I love what I &apos;m doing here .
Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
We could pretend like this never happened .
What actually happened ?
Don &apos;t take it seriously .
I should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
Can I ask why this is so important to you ?
Tom saw where Mary lives .
Tom is currently living in Australia .
Tom ate one apple .
I don &apos;t want to say that to Tom .
Did Tom say he left early ?
Do you really want to know ?
Why do you think I &apos;m not happy ?
Tom and Mary are still there .
Don &apos;t give in .
I &apos;ll see you around .
I was very careful .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have no more time .
Have you finished yet ?
Today is your birthday .
I am tired of hearing it .
I wrote a song for you .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
Can &apos;t you just ask Tom to help us ?
Tom didn &apos;t really enjoy studying French .
What does Tom think of Mary ?
I wish it had been that easy .
He said , &quot; I want to be a doctor . &quot;
That &apos;s my idea .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think Alice was beautiful .
Please tell Tom that I called .
Tom is intoxicated .
Tom and Mary are playing with John &apos;s cat .
How was your afternoon ?
She &apos;s got more books .
Can I sit down ?
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
What would you like for supper ?
Do you have any questions ?
Tom is not looking happy .
I don &apos;t care what you say .
Have you ever thought about doing that ?
I don &apos;t know how long .
My life was in danger .
Please give me something to drink .
I &apos;m behind you .
You can go if you want to .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so happy .
I spoke to him about it over the telephone .
Things are quite different now .
Everything looks good .
Where is Tom &apos;s classroom ?
That &apos;s new .
I would like to drink a coffee .
Who is the father ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know that yet .
I &apos;ll walk home from here .
Tom bought Mary a car .
I don &apos;t want to answer the question .
Tom appeared to be sleeping .
I never heard you play it better .
It doesn &apos;t matter so much .
I hope I haven &apos;t misspelled your name .
He is anything but a fool .
Come on , you can do it .
It &apos;s my horse .
I asked Tom to sing .
How many years have you been married ?
Tom and Mary have been married for three years .
I can never go home again .
I don &apos;t remember when and where I met you .
Tom told everyone he was able to speak three languages .
You don &apos;t like me , do you ?
We &apos;ll go on foot .
What are you thinking ?
Tom was sleeping when Mary got home .
Tom likes Mary , you know ?
She &apos;s been working all day long .
I am the same age .
The baby is asleep .
Thank you for giving me this .
My foot hurts .
We &apos;ll have to leave town .
He looks like my father .
Your question is hard to answer .
I &apos;d like to go .
He insists on going to the park with his father .
I don &apos;t need anything now .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
He comes to see my son now and then .
I don &apos;t know why my friend wants us to wait .
Did you ask Tom why he wasn &apos;t at the meeting ?
We want Tom to stay for a couple of more days .
You have to come .
I cannot eat anything today .
The morning was clear .
He &apos;s studying now .
I came here as fast as I could .
The office seems very busy today .
I don &apos;t need your help , but you need mine .
Can you explain that to me ?
He isn &apos;t able to do it .
That is no business of his .
You were late for work .
You &apos;re too big .
Tom helped Mary to her feet .
Where is the nearest bank ?
I &apos;m supposed to help Tom with his homework .
Why &apos;s Tom looking at me ?
We &apos;ll eat at six o &apos;clock .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
It &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
He gets along very well with his friends .
Tom lost his job .
I am a man .
Tom asked me if I had found the keys .
You can do it , Tom . I know you can .
I &apos;m looking forward to next summer .
I remember it like it happened yesterday .
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here .
Are all of them your friends ?
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about it right now .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that anymore .
I would like you to meet my parents .
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for his advice .
You have to give me more time .
What do you think of these shoes ?
Tom and I are both a little busy right now .
I must know the truth about him .
Tom let me drive his car .
Let me have a look at it .
I was tied up until very late getting some things in order .
This is too hard a problem for me to solve .
You &apos;re my friend .
I was in the hospital for a few days .
You seem to know a great deal about Tom .
Maybe I should stop now .
Look out for Tom .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m ready .
I &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s Tom .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
How do you know about this ?
Tom said he was asked to leave .
He speaks English well .
Tom wants to go to Boston .
My glass is full .
I don &apos;t want to drive .
I &apos;m very tired now .
The baby &apos;s awake .
Try harder next time .
There &apos;s got to be an answer .
You &apos;re very funny .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
Everything remains as it was .
Is Sunday the first day of the week ?
She stayed up late last night .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom went too far .
Who could you do that with ?
You might not want to go there by yourself .
You can &apos;t stay here .
Where did you get this ?
Tom is new here .
These are animals .
My bike has been stolen .
I thought I &apos;d lost you forever .
They are running in the park .
It has been raining for two days .
Tom has finally finished doing that .
Tom wants to be different .
Tom was sleeping .
She &apos;s in danger .
I would like to be alone .
What can you tell me about that ?
She plays tennis every Sunday .
I never meant to put you in any danger .
He is still angry .
I saw Tom in the library yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t get paid for it .
Where have you been all this time ?
I want to do everything I &apos;m supposed to do .
He is in love with her .
I have a great deal to do .
I &apos;m not afraid of anything .
He took off his clothes .
I came because of Tom .
I &apos;m sorry I said that .
Who is that ?
Tom is a very good person .
He doesn &apos;t speak my language .
I saw the whole thing .
Has something else happened ?
Dinner &apos;s almost ready .
It is seven now .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
What are you going to say to Tom ?
Tom is a good teacher .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know that .
Animals are our friends .
They &apos;ll find you .
We can &apos;t do it without you .
You &apos;ll see Tom .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
Tom got dressed and went outside .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with Mary .
How do you get to work ?
He was not happy at all .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
That task wasn &apos;t easy .
I don &apos;t feel like waiting any longer .
Please think about the problem .
I &apos;ve met that girl before .
If you want to be alone , I &apos;ll leave .
Tom is nervous .
Don &apos;t blame the mistake on her .
She is not here yet .
Tom seems to like speaking French .
I know why you came down here .
I couldn &apos;t go to work because I was sick .
Tom is behind you .
I wonder why Tom was late .
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
Did Tom really kill himself ?
It &apos;s a good deal .
You should eat more .
He knows no English .
Nobody can love him .
I think he doesn &apos;t like it here .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything today .
Could you say that again ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been living here long .
I &apos;m sure that it &apos;ll be fun .
Do they have that ?
I figured you should know .
Tom wanted to be a teacher .
There &apos;s a cat in my house .
What &apos;s your beef ?
Do you want to see more ?
Tom cried for help .
Tom , please be careful .
I wonder where that ship is headed .
Tom kept writing .
Tom wants one .
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
Tom is afraid .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
I can &apos;t remember your name .
Why don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
Tom speaks quickly .
Tom has done a lot for Mary .
Tom knows Mary is right .
Don &apos;t be silly .
Don &apos;t you want one of these ?
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
My eyes are tired .
Do not look out the window .
We all make mistakes .
I &apos;d like to ask you a couple of questions .
She really wants to go .
I &apos;m thirty years old .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is here .
Tom never listens to Mary .
Why was Tom in Boston ?
Why &apos;s Tom here and not Mary ?
I think that helped me .
I can &apos;t take Tom &apos;s money .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do anything .
That doesn &apos;t matter to me .
The rain turned to snow .
I like to go to the movies .
I want you to do this .
I don &apos;t understand that .
We met them yesterday .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom is all right .
I will deal with them myself .
No one knows whether he loves her or not .
I was at Tom &apos;s house . Where were you ?
I don &apos;t want it .
Tom is coming back .
You can always ask me for help .
Tom is helping his wife .
How long were you at the party ?
Tom could hardly walk .
What are you implying ?
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes .
Tom wants Mary to be happy .
No one thinks that way anymore .
He is very fast .
Tom didn &apos;t help much .
Someone might see us .
Tom thought Mary knew John .
Tom is in his room now .
Tom never got married .
Tom suggested we do that tomorrow .
They haven &apos;t come back home yet .
When are you coming to Boston ?
I thought you said your name was Tom .
I knew I could do it .
This is a good thing .
We missed the last train .
Where is the library ?
I don &apos;t know what we will do .
You need to tell me the truth .
Tom says he saw Mary .
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
He saw the girl .
Come whenever you want to .
You understand why , don &apos;t you ?
She acted as if she knew nothing about it .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
Tom kept his mouth shut .
You aren &apos;t very good at it , are you ?
I hope so , too .
What he said is true in a sense .
He put milk in his coffee .
Let &apos;s start with beer .
She is fond of playing tennis .
I suppose you &apos;re hungry .
Give me some water , please .
Tom thought only of Mary .
I never want to hear his name again .
I can &apos;t imagine what he is thinking .
Is it too small ?
We still want to help you .
You &apos;ve done it again .
Just how long do you think it &apos;ll take to get there ?
He likes sleeping .
I lost my glasses .
We don &apos;t like you .
We did all we could .
I want to buy an automobile .
Tom walked out into his backyard .
I &apos;ve got a lot of friends .
What kind of questions will they ask ?
I &apos;m not sorry that I did this .
Tom knew where Mary wanted to live .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you asked .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
I suppose he &apos;ll come .
It &apos;s a secret .
I know Tom would love to see you .
Tom was hungry .
I &apos;ll give you a piece of advice .
I will make a man of you .
What else did you two do ?
What &apos;re you up to today ?
The teacher spoke too fast for us to understand .
Why do you want to be alone all the time ?
I helped her with her work .
I think Tom is pretty angry .
Tom admitted that he hadn &apos;t read Mary &apos;s book .
You &apos;ve told me that before .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have to do anything .
Can I speak to the doctor ?
You can sit down if you like .
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s friend , aren &apos;t you ?
The dog must be hungry .
Have you ever heard her play the piano ?
It belongs to us .
What did Tom tell you about me ?
Tom now has a good reason to be happy .
I guess I should &apos;ve done more .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what he was going to say .
I want Tom to do it .
I think I &apos;m in love with you .
We &apos;re going to Boston for a week .
Tom won &apos;t wait .
What do you expect from us ?
Tom is 3 years older than Mary .
I &apos;m having dinner now .
This book is full of errors .
I &apos;ll be at home .
You &apos;re just a kid .
Tom wrote to Mary .
I &apos;m not interested in Tom .
We &apos;ll get this one .
Why didn &apos;t you just pay Tom ?
Give me your shirt .
Did you watch the movie ?
The last time I saw Tom he was headed toward the beach .
What time do we leave tomorrow ?
I &apos;ll see you at the hospital .
I want to do it again .
Tom stopped talking and began to eat .
I don &apos;t know anyone here , except Tom .
He seemed to have been ill .
The house was big .
Tom isn &apos;t going to see me .
Tom couldn &apos;t find a job .
Let &apos;s ask some questions .
He is not coming , apparently .
Why did you ask ?
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
You may not like it .
I looked at Tom .
This place is dangerous .
Did you eat something last night ?
She lost both her parents .
Have you seen this ?
No one will know .
Can anybody help me ?
The room is hot .
I &apos;ve got enough money for a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
Tom and Mary only speak French to their children .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind all that much .
We &apos;re looking for Tom .
You should go to bed early .
What do you want to be ?
Tom didn &apos;t get up before six .
I know neither of them .
There &apos;s no food left .
I have lost my camera .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
There he is .
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman .
You aren &apos;t any better than me .
He comes to see me once in a while .
I didn &apos;t speak with Tom .
My sister is very fond of children .
I want to go play with my friends .
I would like you to come with me .
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
Tom knows that Mary loves him .
This box is light enough for him to carry .
Tom ate out .
Have we understood each other ?
Look at that one there .
This is how I did it .
It may occur at any moment .
Are you saying that Tom can &apos;t understand French at all ?
I bought her a new car .
She doesn &apos;t listen to music at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the right to say that .
That &apos;s how it should be .
They might be able to help us .
Tom will have no choice .
I &apos;ve got as much to lose here as you do .
It should be like this .
I must fix it .
How &apos;s your little sister ?
Can I sleep here ?
Tom also speaks a little French .
I can &apos;t remember exactly where Tom lives .
We never swim .
Tom wasn &apos;t with Mary .
Her answer was incorrect .
I came here yesterday .
I &apos;ve missed my train .
I am concerned for your health .
Come on up , Tom .
Have you made up your mind to come with me ?
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
Can you eat these ?
What happened to the money I gave you ?
I will have to be away for some time .
I think there &apos;s someone out there .
You &apos;re better off without me .
Tom doesn &apos;t agree .
I couldn &apos;t catch the train .
Who took the money ?
Do you have enough money ?
You already know the truth .
Tom hasn &apos;t found Mary yet .
Where do you think I met her ?
Don &apos;t be disappointed .
What do you want to watch ?
I want to read the book .
Tom read a lot .
Our children like dogs , but I prefer cats .
I don &apos;t believe everything Tom tells me .
You can always sleep on my couch .
I want to know what that is .
I wouldn &apos;t have come here if Tom hadn &apos;t asked me to .
Do you have a dictionary ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want it , does he ?
Tom told Mary that she could do whatever she wanted to do .
We live in a house .
We &apos;re sorry , but we can &apos;t do anything more for you .
Tom told me he was cold .
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well .
Tom has a house in Boston .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
Close your eyes .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
Come on .
All three of those men are from Boston .
I believe it &apos;s finished .
You almost missed me .
I like Tom , but he doesn &apos;t like me .
It is easy for me to solve the problem .
This time I &apos;ll try it .
I &apos;ll probably never do that again .
I imagine that &apos;s true .
What do you think he did ?
I &apos;m happy to do this for you .
Tom is likely to still be outside .
Tom helped his friends find a place to live .
He asked me if I knew his father .
You &apos;re old enough to know better .
Tom , do you want to go with me ?
Can you wait a bit ?
I like my house .
We are his children .
He will look after the cats for me while I &apos;m abroad .
Who came ?
The job is as good as done .
You &apos;re not going to understand it .
I need Tom now .
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
What does that tell us ?
I want you out here .
That &apos;s what we think .
We &apos;re very sorry .
I told Tom I was tired .
Let &apos;s go to a movie .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
Who ate the bread ?
Don &apos;t you have school today ?
My sister showed a new watch to me .
Where have you been all day ?
Why are you mad at Tom ?
Could you please stop saying that ?
Can I get a little help , please ?
I understand that .
I need some bread and milk .
I only have time for coffee .
Tom fell down and wasn &apos;t able to get up .
It is going to rain this afternoon .
If possible , I &apos;d like to see him .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in the city .
He &apos;s after me .
Tom &apos;s eaten at that restaurant before .
Who do you think it is ?
He &apos;ll understand .
Tom looked quite tired .
Tom has already started .
Tom is in his room .
What &apos;s the plan , Tom ?
They didn &apos;t have any reasons to be angry .
What was the question ?
I hate myself .
You can go if you want .
Do you want to see my room ?
What are we going to do about that ?
No one ever asked .
I had some fun .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
Tom &apos;s French is better than mine .
You &apos;d better not wait here .
How do I do this ?
We &apos;re not happy .
Tom sings well .
He seems quite happy .
Tom stopped here .
No one lives in that building anymore .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
He came to my office yesterday .
We study French at school .
Have you eaten supper yet ?
How is your brother ?
Tom released Mary .
Tom and Mary usually get home later than their parents do .
What do you eat for lunch ?
I read a book as I walked .
Don &apos;t you feel cold ?
He asked about the others .
I &apos;m tired of waiting .
When my mother was young , she was very beautiful .
The dog seems sick .
Give that back to me .
She ran as fast as she was able to .
Tom told me what you did .
The beach isn &apos;t far from here .
I didn &apos;t eat dinner last night .
I &apos;m still sleepy .
I didn &apos;t give Tom any choice .
Tom never listens .
You can &apos;t buy happiness .
How many times did you talk to Tom last week ?
&quot; I don &apos;t understand this &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand it either . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
You &apos;re good at French , aren &apos;t you ?
This isn &apos;t fun .
Nobody knows my country .
They saw nothing .
Can you please be quiet ?
I &apos;d like three of these .
Tom will explain it to you .
They made me wait for a long time .
By the time you get out of prison , she &apos;ll be married .
This tree is dead and should be cut down .
Would you like to know how I did that ?
He is sure to come .
A bus transported us from the airport to the city .
Who &apos;s going to believe that ?
Do you object to smoking ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French very well .
Why am I going ?
Tom falls asleep every night watching TV .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
You &apos;re doing it wrong !
He is two years older than you .
Do you want to see it ?
I think you should give Tom a chance .
I had better ask her .
She opened the letter quickly .
I will call you in an hour .
I was told that I should see a doctor .
Nobody was home .
I think it &apos;s about time for us to leave .
Tom loves going to the beach .
I &apos;ve already told Tom what needs to be done .
It is very cold here all the year round .
I have to talk to Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t stop talking .
You have my word on that .
No one left .
Why is it so quiet here ?
You must go home .
It &apos;s not good .
Tom sure is full of himself .
Can you show it to me ?
Tom needs to see me right away .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
What &apos;s Tom reading ?
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
She opened the door .
Tom called Mary back the next day .
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom told me that he was disappointed .
It being Sunday today , we have no school .
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
Tom can write well .
It may be true .
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
What shall I do with her letter ?
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
Tom can &apos;t leave just yet .
We have nothing to left eat .
We &apos;re not getting married .
Is the coffee strong enough ?
Tom seems young .
Tom is eating lunch now .
It &apos;s very hot today .
Are you certain about this ?
You &apos;re not my girlfriend .
I don &apos;t care what anyone says .
She &apos;s completely crazy about him .
It isn &apos;t Tom .
I don &apos;t feel very lucky .
I &apos;d like to read it .
This is none of your business .
Tom spent more than three years in prison .
We can talk about it .
I think my suitcase was stolen .
What would you like to drink today ?
Tom gave us all the money he had on him .
I need a little help .
Tom may be home on Monday .
The rain was beating against the windows .
Why are you being so nice to me ?
You must show me how it works .
You can count on him .
I &apos;m happy that Tom is happy .
I don &apos;t know what Tom does .
Tom was always different from the other kids .
Come to us .
I know that Tom is in love with Mary .
We &apos;re worried .
I &apos;m glad Tom is going to help us .
You look like you &apos;ve just lost your best friend .
Tom did do that .
Let &apos;s get some lunch .
How old is this airplane ?
How did you manage to get Tom to do that ?
Who is in this room ?
I want to see Boston .
Nobody knows where Tom is .
I know that Tom knows .
Is that the train I have to take ?
Why are you so quiet ?
We &apos;re happy .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I &apos;d like to hear a story .
I shouldn &apos;t have played outside in the rain .
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
Have you ever seen anything like this before ?
Tom walked over to where Mary was sitting .
Thanks for your help .
I hope he hasn &apos;t had an accident .
Can you get it repaired ?
This is the first time I &apos;ve seen anything like this .
I think both of them are right .
I love learning languages .
When did it happen ?
Tom eats out almost every evening .
No one really knows what &apos;s going on .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I see Tom and Mary .
Shall I drive you home ?
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
What is the truth ?
When did this occur ?
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
Let Tom go .
Tom made us do it .
She still loves him even though he doesn &apos;t love her anymore .
Tom saw Mary do that .
Don &apos;t make fun of others .
Can I come to your office tomorrow ?
How well do you know Tom ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t wait for Mary for more than ten minutes .
It looks like rain .
Tom wanted to learn to read .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
You must learn French .
It &apos;s time to leave .
I couldn &apos;t make it .
He is my brother .
You know I can &apos;t .
Tom will find Mary .
This is a good car .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
How are you going to spend your weekend ?
My passport was stolen .
Can it wait ?
I cannot find time to read the book .
I love living in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t watch TV .
How are you ?
You both love each other , don &apos;t you ?
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
I know that he &apos;s Tom .
Are you here alone ?
Tom has made it happen .
You can &apos;t eat here .
Our teacher doesn &apos;t just speak English , but French too .
We had breakfast .
What do you like most about Boston ?
We know Tom .
The book was better than the movie .
You &apos;re going to be fine .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
He is not coming , either .
Tom and I are fine .
Who &apos;s with Tom ?
Is Tom still able to drive ?
Tom wants to tell you about Mary .
My watch was stolen .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
I &apos;ve got to talk to Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me that he was married .
Take your time with it .
We &apos;re on speaking terms .
I &apos;m worried about the baby .
I didn &apos;t have enough time to do what I wanted to do .
A boy is walking across the street .
If Tom isn &apos;t here by 2 : 30 , he probably won &apos;t come at all .
Men know nothing about women .
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn &apos;t help him .
I can &apos;t wait for him any longer .
No one loves me .
I &apos;ll be going .
No one can tell what &apos;ll happen in the future .
This isn &apos;t a hospital .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
On my way home , I met him .
He was better than I expected .
They &apos;ll never find you here .
We really have to go back to Boston .
Tom asked for help .
Where did you go yesterday ?
What does Tom know ?
I believe you know what I mean .
I saw Tom in the library yesterday .
She failed to keep her promise .
You seem very busy .
Why is everybody scared of Tom ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to like this .
Maybe it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
Did Tom work there ?
Tom had no options left .
Why are you guys here ?
I don &apos;t pretend to understand women .
He walked across the street .
This book is too difficult for me to understand .
Tom seems unable to do that .
I want a car , but I have no money to buy one .
Tom will be here for three more weeks .
Why do you have to do that ?
My father isn &apos;t at home .
It &apos;s great to meet you .
Promise me you &apos;ll never do that again .
If it weren &apos;t for her help , I would not be alive now .
The baby will be able to walk soon .
Tom is driving his car .
I like cats more than dogs .
It has been raining since Sunday .
We &apos;re dying .
I think otherwise .
Tom went into his room and slammed the door .
I still don &apos;t speak French very well .
He keeps his word .
I know you &apos;ll love it .
He sat next to me .
You must not stay in bed .
Tom should hear about this .
Tom may not know French .
I must apologize to Tom .
It is probable that she will come tomorrow .
I arrived ahead of the others .
I have to eat dinner with my boss tonight .
He is old .
I have already read the book .
That &apos;s what we all thought .
He never takes the train .
I feel like vomiting .
There &apos;s something I &apos;ve been wanting to ask you , Tom .
Tom rarely ever spoke .
I have to go to school .
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
One stayed and the other went away .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston .
Tom stood up .
Tom fell off his horse .
The story appears to be true .
What time did the meeting end ?
I &apos;m not surprised to hear that .
Stop telling everyone you &apos;re my brother .
You are always late .
If I had known about it , I would have told you .
I &apos;m feeling kind of tired .
Tom seems to be rich .
I &apos;m certain he &apos;s coming .
I became angry .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the doctor .
I hate when this happens .
I wanted to talk with you .
We know about Tom .
I finally understand .
I can &apos;t go to the movies .
I &apos;ll be at home tomorrow .
I &apos;m not a baby anymore .
There &apos;s somebody I want to talk to first .
What &apos;s Tom doing there ?
They &apos;ve got enough to do already .
I &apos;m happy that you &apos;re happy .
Please don &apos;t go away .
I need to go home .
He was angry with his students .
There &apos;s nobody in the house . Everybody &apos;s outside .
You almost missed me .
Who ran ?
He is very tall .
This watch was your grandfather &apos;s .
A trip to America is out of the question .
I don &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Please , tell me .
I won &apos;t be able to sleep tonight .
Where is Tom &apos;s car ?
They know who I am .
You &apos;re not Tom .
It &apos;s good to be in love .
Tom isn &apos;t going .
Tom often eats in bed .
These are as good as those .
This house is far too small .
I &apos;m not quite sure yet .
Tom may be here .
It &apos;s really simple .
Is that your book ?
I wonder what happened .
I shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
What time did you arrive there ?
Tom wants to come and see you .
Who &apos;s that boy ?
We &apos;re students .
We &apos;ll never get there in time .
Tom says he &apos;s never had a girlfriend .
I suppose they are coming .
Leave it right where it is .
You &apos;re a good student , but you still have a lot to learn .
I want to speak with you .
Take it away .
I never asked for it .
What &apos;ll you have for dinner tonight ?
I know about you .
They won that game .
I &apos;ll join you .
We can &apos;t talk here .
Don &apos;t talk to me about Tom .
Tom will know what this is .
I was helping Tom .
Could you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
The girl said nothing .
He asked her some questions .
No one &apos;s in there .
Why do you want to talk to me ?
You worry too much .
I think we &apos;ll go with you .
What was it like ?
This happens to us all the time .
Tom sat silently .
I heard her singing in her room .
Get away !
I know that this doesn &apos;t interest you .
She always keeps her promises .
That name doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
Tom isn &apos;t the same man he used to be .
I believe I have now told you everything .
Could you please tell me what &apos;s wrong ?
What does your sister do now ?
I didn &apos;t have lunch today .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Boston .
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
This is none of your business .
It &apos;s open to interpretation .
He asked me whether anybody was there .
Maybe Tom is just lucky .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to walk .
Have you eaten your dinner already ?
Did you steal it ?
I want to hear Tom &apos;s voice .
What else could you expect ?
He is pleased with his new car .
I knew I &apos;d be able to do that by 2 : 30 .
Why weren &apos;t you at school yesterday ?
Do you let your children play in the street ?
You are free to leave any time you wish .
Time will show which of us is right .
I &apos;ve been here for hours .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
I want to be here with you .
Do you have any idea who would do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to learn French .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
I know what you are thinking .
Mary is Tom &apos;s first and only love .
Tom never talks about his job .
We need to talk to you .
Her friends look up to her .
It &apos;s from your family .
Tom asked her if she was Mary .
It &apos;s Monday , you know .
The weather is a shade better today .
In that case , I &apos;ll change my mind .
I like apples .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
Tom has died and gone to heaven .
Tom is angry with us .
Do you know why you &apos;re here ?
This is your only chance .
Can he speak French ?
I believe that &apos;ll happen .
The game is over .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
Tom wants to move back to Boston .
Why did he come here ?
Tom didn &apos;t speak to me at all .
You &apos;re young .
I wish I could run as fast as Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to swim .
Let Tom buy a new computer if he wants to .
Tom gave me that .
I expected Tom to be there .
How tall you are !
I &apos;d like to see them both .
I &apos;ll do any kind of work .
Tom wasn &apos;t always this way .
I have to stop drinking .
Why do you say things like that ?
Why does it have to be me ?
Tom says he &apos;s working very hard .
Tom came to me for help .
I cannot read French .
Did you see his face ?
What do you have in your bag ?
Have you heard from him since he left for America ?
Luck had nothing to do with it .
I &apos;m able to run .
Tom said he could give Mary some money .
Tom has problems at school .
That happened here .
To put it clearly , I don &apos;t like him .
Something &apos;s not right here .
I don &apos;t think he can help you .
Why are these people in here ?
I have a big dog .
Let Tom come .
I wonder if something has happened .
Both Tom and Mary don &apos;t like John .
Can I help you ?
What you say is right .
I learn a lot from my father .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that right now .
That &apos;s my boy .
Let &apos;s not speak French today .
I like you just the way you are .
Can you hear us ?
Can I be excused ?
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
We don &apos;t want that anymore .
She is two years older than you .
Tom seems tired tonight .
I need some milk .
We can &apos;t even be certain Tom will attend the meeting .
I &apos;m taller than Tom .
It is hardly possible for him not to make any mistake .
Tom was quite drunk .
I guess that &apos;s all I need .
I want to consult you about something .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem so well .
Let me call Tom .
I love my parents .
You &apos;re better than me .
Tom is learning very quickly .
He arrived too early .
I &apos;m here to apologize .
That &apos;s impossible .
I &apos;m not sick .
We &apos;ll begin work soon .
Tom is helping his mother in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t want to lose my girlfriend .
Can we have a word with you ?
Get to work .
They already know the truth .
Tom wants one .
He put on his glasses and began to read .
He walked quietly .
This bus will take you to the station .
I was only joking .
I cannot fix the computer .
How many hours are left ?
I like her younger sister very much .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
Tom isn &apos;t very good-looking .
I remember it like it was yesterday .
I think I might be able to be there by 2 : 30 .
What &apos;s gotten into you ?
I know Tom doesn &apos;t love you .
Tom likes you a lot .
He found a nice apartment for Mary .
If that guitar weren &apos;t so expensive , I could buy it .
She is accustomed to doing her homework before dinner .
I love you .
Tom has enough money to do whatever he wants to do .
I told Tom to help Mary , but he didn &apos;t .
When does Tom want to do this ?
You cannot be too careful .
Tom was definitely busy .
Tom is your brother .
I &apos;m nervous now .
You &apos;re too late .
Give Tom his keys .
I &apos;m still not understanding anything .
That &apos;s not a secret .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Tom knew there was something in the box , but he didn &apos;t know what .
That can &apos;t be Mary . She &apos;s in the hospital now .
Tom &apos;s dog lay down .
The teacher gave us a lot of homework .
Tom said that he was aching all over .
The door is open .
Tom won &apos;t stay .
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
He wants to be different .
We don &apos;t have snow here .
Tom had a beer .
Tom likes that .
I might see Tom tomorrow .
I hope the bread keeps until tomorrow .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
You &apos;re free to say what you think .
Why would anyone do such a thing ?
When did you go ?
What kind of question is that , Tom ?
I met her late in the evening .
We &apos;re a big family .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
I think your answer is correct .
You can go now .
Tom cooked dinner for Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t working .
You really don &apos;t need to do that .
I think that she knows the truth .
My cat is hungry .
The meeting finished thirty minutes ago .
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
Everybody loves it .
Tom can &apos;t be under thirty .
I &apos;m no good for you .
I think that Tom was born in Australia .
I know it myself .
Who is this girl ?
He &apos;s never satisfied .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t stay long .
I can &apos;t believe I actually thought Tom would change .
I &apos;ll do as you say .
Thank you for coming .
No one comes to visit me anymore .
I like the way you walk .
Is it near here ?
Tom knows us .
She left the room .
Tom has been asking to see you .
We &apos;ll go to the beach if it &apos;s nice tomorrow .
He would not listen to my advice .
Tom asked me to give you this .
I know Tom understands .
Tom barely ate .
Tom fell asleep right away .
I think we should go now .
Is he a doctor ?
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
You have a task to complete .
Who did what ?
I have a couple of questions I need to ask .
You can take a taxi .
I have to stop doing this .
I love life .
Let &apos;s eat out .
May I see my girlfriend now ?
Like his father , he has many books .
Do you have my money ?
Tom had no say in the matter .
I wasn &apos;t ready .
My uncle gave me a camera .
He has nothing to do .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom do that .
What do you want now ?
Tom had no plan at all .
It &apos;s a fish .
He felt at home .
Will you be at home tonight ?
Tom was seriously injured in a traffic accident .
She likes these cats .
I really thought Tom was happy .
Tom wants to know why Mary didn &apos;t go to school today .
It &apos;s time to go .
We &apos;ll consult Tom .
What &apos;s wrong with this plan ?
It is hot in this room .
I don &apos;t feel like working .
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know Tom is a doctor .
What are you going to be when you grow up ?
Tom returned one day earlier than expected .
Go to bed .
Don &apos;t you think I know my own brother ?
What are you doing here so early ?
He was too young to live alone .
I study French at home .
I don &apos;t like being home alone .
I found the game easy .
It &apos;s serious .
Tom wrote that book .
Take any books that you want to read .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything .
We like music .
I think Tom may do that .
Nobody slept .
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
That was easy .
Can we help ?
This is my brother .
I &apos;m going to be late for the meeting .
I have one in the car .
It was very nice of you to help me with my homework .
Turn it off .
He &apos;s very angry with you .
We enjoyed the party very much .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
I don &apos;t know how long I &apos;ll be gone .
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
I &apos;d never say that .
Have you been married for a long time ?
Why isn &apos;t anyone helping Tom ?
What &apos;s up with you today ?
I &apos;m proud of my son .
She has already finished the work .
What have we done ?
Are you from Boston , too ?
That happens to us all the time .
Tom never asked me .
I have to do something .
Tom said he thought that he should learn how to do that .
Tell me where the wine is .
I can afford it .
Tom never mentioned he had a sister .
Where do you live now ?
Tom will need help .
Tom and Mary are rich .
Tom is a fast talker .
She gave him the money .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
You have no right to go there .
Did Tom give you anything ?
You hardly ate anything .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that Tom had a daughter ?
Tom hasn &apos;t finished all his homework yet .
I want you to go home .
Why aren &apos;t you dancing ?
Tom dozed off .
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s happening here .
Pass me the wine , please .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary can .
My house is near the school .
My father was busy .
Don &apos;t play in the street .
I have a plan . Don &apos;t worry .
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
This house is very small .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do with all his money .
Tom said that he needed some money .
Have you tried it before ?
Did Tom give it to you ?
How long is that story ?
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
You have no idea who that is , do you ?
I was disappointed with his speech .
He is short , but he is strong .
You &apos;re welcome to stay with us as long as you want .
We both want to go to Boston .
They all say that .
There &apos;s a lot of rain all the year round .
Tom may not come .
Could you give me a ride to the station ?
Did you understand Tom ?
Mary received beautiful flowers from her son .
I &apos;d better get back to work .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
I &apos;ve heard that Tom can cook as well as , or better than , his wife .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told me that .
I was kind of surprised Tom said that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is busy or not .
Tom seldom gets mad .
What don &apos;t you want me to see ?
I barely know you .
Get Tom some food .
I just spoke to Tom .
I hope you will be able to come to this party .
My hair is too long .
The dog was walking at his heels .
That won &apos;t be easy .
How did you come to hear that ?
You need not have come so early .
We probably shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Not everybody succeeds in life .
Nobody wants you to do that .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
It wasn &apos;t the first time .
It &apos;s really hot there .
I am his friend and will remain so .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is going .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
Don &apos;t give me that !
Tom got into bed .
Thank you for coming to see me .
What do you want to hear from me ?
Where are the women ?
How old is your grandfather ?
Tom thinks you want me to pay for it .
He came to see you yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait that long .
Tom never comes .
She made a good speech .
What you &apos;ve heard about me isn &apos;t true .
Tom is busy writing a letter .
He was angry with himself .
I heard her sing a song .
I wish I could go to the party with you .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t exactly see eye to eye .
My eyes get tired very easily .
You &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;m real sorry I wasn &apos;t able to help .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
Tom brought his dog to school .
Who is your teacher ?
Tom is strong .
That &apos;s the problem we have to solve .
They &apos;re already here .
I can swim across the river .
Be nice to the children .
As soon as Tom finished work , he went home .
Does that answer satisfy you ?
He got what he wanted .
I wonder why Tom is afraid .
She doesn &apos;t have any friends .
I &apos;d be willing to pay you .
I don &apos;t think Tom has as much money as Mary does .
I want to hear it from you .
Tom seemed lucky .
It &apos;s not exactly a secret .
I prefer it that way .
Tom knows that he can win .
What do you want me to say ?
I &apos;m disappointed .
Why don &apos;t we eat at a restaurant tonight ?
The food &apos;s ready .
Tom will say yes .
I went into the house .
Can you open it ?
I &apos;m extremely sorry .
I can understand you to some extent .
How did you come to know this ?
Tom will be working at home tomorrow .
Tell me where she lives .
I think Tom is still in Boston .
I haven &apos;t done that yet .
I was not feeling well .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
Do you want me to help you ?
Tom is somewhere in this building .
Tom is not good enough .
Did you give Tom my phone number ?
Tom didn &apos;t buy bread .
Tom had nothing to read .
You don &apos;t have to go .
She gave him some money .
You don &apos;t have to answer these questions .
Tom is good at cooking .
You &apos;re a problem .
I bought this book yesterday .
He writes to his mother every now and then .
My bag was stolen .
He fell down on the floor .
I think that my mom knows .
My mind is a blank .
I would rather not talk about it .
I know what you &apos;re going to say .
I still haven &apos;t done it .
They &apos;ll be afraid .
What &apos;s going on with you and Tom ?
Do you have a book ?
What do we do with it ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to do that .
&quot; Where is my book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s in the classroom . &quot;
You &apos;ve disappointed us .
Tom seemed to be quite busy .
Tom likes that one .
He died one year ago .
Is Tom in trouble ?
You &apos;d better tell Tom you &apos;re sorry .
I saw Tom three weeks ago .
I don &apos;t like school .
Tom made a big mistake .
I saw Tom last night in the library .
Why don &apos;t you just tell Tom ?
Let &apos;s meet at 6 : 30 .
No one could solve the problem .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
Isn &apos;t this what you want ?
Tom is proud of his car .
We were starting to worry about you .
Tom asked Mary where he should put his suitcase .
Tom hardly said a word all day .
Tom told me he wanted to leave the company .
She doesn &apos;t speak my language .
You know how it is .
This is just water .
We must leave right away .
I &apos;ll take it .
My mother doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
The room was full of people .
Don &apos;t be too hard on yourself .
How kind of you !
What I have to tell you is very important .
We &apos;ll speak to Tom later .
Mary pretended she was my sister .
I let Tom drink some of my beer .
Tom is my boy .
&quot; Not everyone can come to our party . &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s not coming ? &quot;
You can stay only if you &apos;re quiet .
We were very disappointed to hear the news .
I don &apos;t remember anything about the incident .
Tom was sitting on the bed .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to get married .
I don &apos;t drive often .
You have to keep your promise .
Tom had so much money that he did not know what to do with it . It was far more than he needed to live .
You &apos;re drunk .
He likes to run .
Mary is the only girl I &apos;ve ever been in love with .
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing .
Excuse me .
That &apos;s what I need to do .
Tom found Mary .
I can understand why you don &apos;t want to eat there .
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
Tom no longer has to do that .
Can I sit with you ?
Why should Tom visit Boston ?
I &apos;ve worked here for ten years .
I &apos;ve got to do this now .
I just want you to know that I &apos;m here for you .
Why won &apos;t you believe me ?
I have something else I need to give you .
We didn &apos;t try .
I &apos;m nervous .
How can I get there ?
Are you through with the book ?
I wonder what Tom is doing now .
We have a bit more work to do .
Tom is easy to talk to .
I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t understand .
I &apos;d love to dance with you .
I don &apos;t know how you can eat that .
Which is better ?
We &apos;re meeting at my place at 2 : 30 .
Tom and Mary have been married for about three years .
Tom likes to eat while he &apos;s watching TV .
I have to take off .
Pay very close attention .
I hope you &apos;ve learned something from your mistake .
When her mother came , she pretended to be studying .
The flowers in the garden are very beautiful .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary .
I don &apos;t fear death .
He kept me waiting for more than an hour .
Tom turned on the TV .
Who found you ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
I want a lot more .
Let me have a look at it .
I &apos;m not saying this to hurt you , but it &apos;s the truth .
People here are happy .
The station is not far from here .
You were told this would happen .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m so stupid .
Tom wrote a song for Mary .
Tom is not fast enough .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at home ?
I think you &apos;re nuts .
Tom sat down on the floor .
I can &apos;t go back to Australia . I &apos;m wanted by the police there .
Tom tried to remain calm .
Tom is rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom likes this .
I can &apos;t do that now .
I know I did that .
Are you sure this is what Tom wanted us to buy ?
He helped me fix my watch .
Tom makes Mary happy .
How can I get to heaven ?
Tom works for a small company .
Where are your parents ?
I know how much you care about Tom .
Tom gave this to me .
Ask Tom if you don &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
May I run with you ?
That &apos;s news to me .
I will be gone by the time she comes back .
I love studying languages .
There is no person to do it .
What do you have there ?
You don &apos;t know how much I love you .
Tom &apos;s apartment is within walking distance of the train station .
Tom didn &apos;t make it very far .
I knew you &apos;d be here .
I should learn French .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook so well .
I need a vacation !
Is that supposed to happen ?
How exactly do you do that ?
It &apos;s not going to take long .
Tom has been busy all morning .
The problem is what we should do with this money .
Can you help me find my keys ?
What was I saying ?
I can &apos;t do what you want .
Tom has already seen it .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
Where does he live ?
It &apos;s my book .
This may be our only chance .
You know how Tom is .
I didn &apos;t see her .
What have you eaten today ?
The old man lives by himself .
You may ask any questions you want .
I guess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
Is Monday OK ?
Tom and Mary work well together .
Let me go and buy some bread .
Isn &apos;t that Tom ?
Why are you siding with Tom ?
I wish Tom would come to Boston .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
Are you new here ?
I &apos;m glad I could help you .
Someone told me Mary left her husband .
I need someone who can speak French .
Are you still happy with your new car ?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I wanted to do .
Tom is fast , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom probably did that last Monday .
Do you believe me now ?
There &apos;s a good restaurant not too far from here .
Tom and Mary live in a small house .
I saw her yesterday .
I understand that Tom does that .
All you have to do is tell Tom to leave .
Tom seems to like studying French .
You &apos;re not paying attention .
Tom retreated to his bedroom after dinner .
I want some money .
I saw him there .
Tom put his hat back on .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough money .
It belongs to us .
It scares me .
I &apos;d very much like to know your opinion .
May I ask you a question ?
Tom needn &apos;t have worried .
Doesn &apos;t that look fun ?
When did Tom start working here ?
Did you give it to him last year ?
You &apos;ll find our house at the end of the next street .
We no longer need you .
I came here with my mom .
My family lives in Boston .
Be very careful .
Why is that important ?
Can I get a little help , please ?
Is it your fault or ours ?
How far is it from here to the station ?
Tom likes taking walks by himself .
Tom &apos;s not very good at it .
I &apos;m coming for Tom .
He did the work better than anyone else .
Let &apos;s go get some food .
Tom is always happy .
They are expected any minute now .
I can &apos;t remember how I got here .
I &apos;ll take care of the dog while you are out .
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
You can &apos;t possibly be serious .
He lives near my house .
We know who you are .
I &apos;m supposed to be working this afternoon .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
What are these ?
I &apos;m happy you &apos;re happy .
I do not want to reply to his letter .
You &apos;re after Tom .
I don &apos;t like your name .
He fell asleep right away .
Tom didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
Where &apos;s your money ?
This is my school .
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
Tom has been nice to everyone .
Please get out of my office immediately .
I don &apos;t think Tom will be able to do that .
There is no one in the house .
Ask Tom to apologize to Mary .
Tom looked very good .
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
Nobody understands you .
Won &apos;t you have some more coffee ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about Mary .
Who told you about me ?
That was not the only problem .
Can I work here ?
You tried .
It may already be too late for him .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll come up with something .
I &apos;m taking Tom to Boston with me .
I gave you my answer already .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have even been there .
It &apos;s been a long time since we last saw each other .
I asked him to do that .
The question is whether he can do it or not .
I have already eaten lunch .
He could not speak clearly .
Tom knew he didn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom drove fast .
Men are better at this than women .
What are you sorry about ?
Do you want me to stay or do you want me to go ?
I &apos;ll take any job you can offer me .
It &apos;s not for me to say .
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow .
Why does Tom want me not to do that ?
I think he did it .
Tom stuck to his promise .
Tom stopped by .
He &apos;s not going to make it .
You &apos;ll get well soon .
Are you eating lunch ?
Tom found one .
Tom is my teacher .
Tom writes a letter to his mother every week .
You &apos;ve just missed Tom .
Tom is accustomed to winning .
All of the students were present .
Tom took off his shoes .
You all remember Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you next Sunday .
Why don &apos;t you have a seat ?
Tom will be disappointed .
Tom made tea for me .
You &apos;re the only one I have .
I &apos;m happy to be able to help you .
I want to buy my children everything I never had .
Why didn &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
You speak French very well .
You were late for work .
Tom says he isn &apos;t afraid .
I don &apos;t have any other option .
Tom and Mary are waiting outside .
I can &apos;t do without your advice .
Tom can do it better than I can .
Tell me what I have to do .
Everyone &apos;s reading .
During the night , everything looks different .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to lose my job .
Your name came up at the meeting today .
Tom was starting to feel sleepy .
I &apos;d like to dance .
Why can &apos;t we just go home ?
I didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
This was too much for Tom .
My mother is making a cake for my father .
Tom is about my age .
Tom wished he had more time .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
I &apos;ll play with you .
Tom looked at Mary .
You may go home now if you like .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to school ?
I can &apos;t remember the last time I spoke to Tom .
It just makes no sense .
How do you feel about it ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone .
He usually goes to work at 8 a.m .
Give me your hand .
There is a television in the room .
It &apos;ll stop raining before long .
What else did you do there ?
I do not like him either .
Tom doesn &apos;t write to me anymore .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I remember reading this book .
Please , tell me .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
We aren &apos;t like that .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
He sat in front of me .
Tom would never do such a thing .
What have you guys been up to ?
Look here .
What do you think of war ?
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
You can &apos;t trust anything he says .
You don &apos;t look all that happy .
Tom is strong , but Mary isn &apos;t .
This is my sister .
He is able to swim very fast .
How old are your children now ?
Tom must &apos;ve left the water running .
I &apos;m older than you think .
Our teacher is not always kind to us .
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
Tom is afraid of making mistakes .
I didn &apos;t care if anyone saw me .
Everything is all right .
Nobody asked .
That &apos;s a good plan .
I &apos;m coming .
This is where Tom stays when he &apos;s in Boston .
Tom is quiet .
Tom told me that he was disappointed .
You need to stop saying that .
Aren &apos;t you going to drink that ?
His son died last year .
I go to work every day .
Dinner will be ready in about five minutes .
Tom is just trying to be friendly .
Tom never makes his bed .
Why did you come home so late ?
You may be right about that .
I don &apos;t care what others think .
I managed to find his office .
I saw Tom do that .
The money is on the table .
I &apos;ve finally learned how to do that .
Maybe I should &apos;ve told Tom .
Tom told me about the accident .
I &apos;ll walk home .
No one will believe you .
Tom spoke in French at the meeting .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
I know what I saw .
They aren &apos;t here .
You are not going to make it in time for school .
Tom didn &apos;t take Mary seriously .
We pay Tom well .
It wasn &apos;t you , was it ?
Tom sat under a tree .
Something &apos;s strange .
Do you know why Tom did it ?
Why is it here ?
When are you coming back ?
I will not go unless it stops raining .
Do you know why Tom didn &apos;t win ?
I don &apos;t want to ever see you again .
Her father died when she was three .
It won &apos;t be that easy .
Let me pay .
It &apos;s not for you .
When did it occur ?
I &apos;m only going to show you once .
He eats too much .
I was tired and cold .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here in a long time .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
How &apos;s Tom tonight ?
Where are you from , Tom ?
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
Everyone is interested in that .
Tom said that probably wouldn &apos;t happen again anytime soon .
I &apos;d like something to drink .
I was glad to hear of your success .
I went there to meet him .
Tom was very rich .
I thought Tom was on vacation in Australia .
She can &apos;t find her hat .
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston ?
Tom makes me better .
I know who you are .
She devoted herself to her children .
You don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s home is , do you ?
May I go out to play when I have read this book ?
In Japan , all children go to school .
What do you want to see ?
She gave him the car .
My father isn &apos;t home yet .
Tom enjoys himself at everything he does .
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
I found it easy to answer the question .
He doesn &apos;t understand you .
Tom arrived earlier than usual yesterday .
He went to bed .
Tom sat down near the window , put on his glasses and began to read the book that Mary had given him .
Do you want it or not ?
Did you talk to your wife ?
I &apos;ve made up my mind .
They are talking about music .
You ought to know .
I don &apos;t want to get married , but I want to have kids .
Where are our friends ?
The kids are driving me crazy .
Tom is not here .
What did you do yesterday ?
Tom put his shirt back on .
We don &apos;t have that .
May I speak to Tom ?
We don &apos;t have tea .
That &apos;s not possible anymore .
It wasn &apos;t until this morning that Tom told me that .
He had no objection .
He doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
Tom was very angry with Mary .
Where shall we meet ?
Tom likes fish .
Tom is just nervous .
He crossed the street .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
Here &apos;s what I don &apos;t get .
How old were you when you fell in love for the first time ?
I don &apos;t want to live my life like this .
Tom is no longer in prison .
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
You &apos;re a man now .
Is your mom here ?
Look , I know you &apos;re busy .
Tom has to come with me .
We are all in agreement .
I need to do something .
What do I know ?
I am watching an old film .
Tom asked Mary for her phone number .
How much does he spend per month ?
English is not easy for me .
I look forward to reading your report .
Without you , I &apos;m nothing .
Tom went on reading .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
It is not so difficult as you think .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid of death .
I &apos;ll pay later .
I think you should go and visit Tom .
There &apos;s nothing to do here .
Do you want to take this one ?
Tom is the kind of man who knows how to make money .
Can you help me a little ?
I think I &apos;ll buy a new car .
Tom is a dear friend .
It &apos;s not like I don &apos;t want to do it .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
Money can &apos;t buy happiness .
This is your chance .
Tom is looking at us .
What was it that you gave him ?
She looks like her mother .
We want to know .
Tom knows what Mary did .
She handed him a book .
Tom &apos;s making his bed .
It &apos;s going to be hard to do that without a lot of help .
Do you have any questions ?
I can &apos;t wait to tell Tom the good news .
You must remain calm .
We &apos;re studying French .
Tom asked us not to come .
Tom will be back in three hours .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play the piano anymore .
She writes to him every week .
We &apos;ll meet Tom .
You &apos;re going to get us all in trouble .
Thanks for the good advice .
I need to apologize to Tom .
I want to ask Tom what he &apos;ll do .
Tom was talking very loudly .
I assumed Tom was waiting for Mary .
That &apos;s good news to me .
I know something you don &apos;t .
I do not want to work .
Aren &apos;t you happy here ?
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
When are you going home ?
The girl did not say anything .
I just want to be certain that it &apos;s OK .
Tom said that he had eaten lunch with his friends .
Tom already left .
Give me the key .
Tom may be studying French .
Things weren &apos;t always easy .
That &apos;ll do it .
I used to live close to Tom .
I got up about five .
Where &apos;s my computer ?
Who do you want to speak to ?
Tom usually gets to work at least thirty minutes early .
Tom is your son , not mine .
Take Tom downtown .
Don &apos;t worry about it .
Let them talk .
Where have you been ?
You can tell me the truth .
Why are you avoiding me ?
You don &apos;t have to be here .
Tom has already started eating lunch .
Would you like another piece of cake ?
I have to stay home today .
This is not for you .
Tom made some coffee .
I know where you are .
I &apos;d like a table by the window .
Give me five days .
Who else was at the party ?
I had to talk to Tom .
The sun rises earlier in the summer .
Our problems are far from over .
Who &apos;s that boy standing at the door ?
Why did you allow it to happen ?
What don &apos;t you want me to see ?
You &apos;re very helpful .
I can swim .
She left here right away .
I remember everything you tell me .
See you tomorrow .
Tom really made you happy , didn &apos;t he ?
What did Tom take ?
Tom gave it back to Mary .
Tom will be here .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten all day .
Tom and Mary are both very frightened .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever been this busy .
Thank you for everything you have done for me .
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s too dangerous .
Tom tried .
His daughter has become a pretty woman .
Why don &apos;t you try and get some sleep ?
When are you moving into your new house ?
Tom didn &apos;t even look at Mary .
Have you ever stolen anything ?
Tom should be back before 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t like eggs .
I felt like I would die .
Do you know who lives in that house ?
They want to learn English .
Tom slept outside .
Tom saw Mary at school .
I never thought it would happen to me .
Tom is a better swimmer than Mary is .
Do you want me to go ?
Tom made me come here .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Boston .
I want to go with Tom .
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
I know what &apos;s going on .
No one was badly injured .
Tom started studying French three years ago .
I thought he was sick .
I need you in my life .
I &apos;m very proud of my daughter .
I want you to have this .
Have you already eaten ?
It looks like Tom .
Did you hear about Tom and Mary ?
I saw Tom leaving his house .
Look at the picture .
Tom wants me to do that .
Are you a teacher or a student ?
I &apos;m not here to help you .
Tom &apos;s fast .
There is only one book on the desk .
This is where the fun begins .
This is our only chance .
You &apos;re needed here at the office .
He seemed to have been rich .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom wanted to live .
I am to blame .
Tom was silent .
It won &apos;t take long .
Are you angry at me ?
I feel really stupid .
It &apos;s not easy being married to Tom .
We &apos;ve been up all night .
I study French at school .
They never give up .
I &apos;m not very strong .
Children need to play .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what kind of person Mary is .
Tom showed me how to solve the problem .
I can &apos;t imagine it .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I came here to give you something .
Tom makes Mary very happy .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s boyfriend anymore .
I know how to do it .
I missed my flight . Can I get on the next flight ?
You &apos;re my child .
I said I &apos;ll get it .
Make the time to do it .
How are you going ?
Would you like tea or coffee ?
Tom is quite handsome .
I have a house not too far from here .
Why are you so busy ?
Everyone is ready .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s girl .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
We want to talk .
We &apos;ll be living in Boston .
Tom expects too much of Mary .
Did you tell Tom about this ?
My father was never around .
Tom looked pretty tired .
What do you know about Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
Tom knew Mary could speak French fairly well .
What do you want us to do ?
You &apos;ve got to let me go .
He has too much pride .
He sat down to read a story .
I need to know before 2 : 30 .
It &apos;s too fast .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school anymore .
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children .
How come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
Tom said that I should leave .
I don &apos;t think I want to study French with you .
What do you say to that , Tom ?
It may well be true .
We won &apos;t need your help today .
Who &apos;s there ?
I can &apos;t remember his name .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a big deal .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
Why would I want to have dinner with Tom ?
Did you talk to Tom about it ?
I have to get home .
I called Tom .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
This should be fun .
I &apos;m going to tell you everything .
Tom can &apos;t have gone to bed yet .
I hope nobody got hurt .
Would you like to drink anything ?
Is this your dog ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want some of this ?
Have you ever tried to swim across this river ?
We got married .
Please don &apos;t ask .
Tom speaks French as well as I do .
It must &apos;ve been expensive .
You can &apos;t pretend that this didn &apos;t happen .
What do you want with us ?
Have you made a decision ?
I think Tom may do that .
I &apos;ll take care of this dog .
You can cook here .
What did they do ?
Why don &apos;t you just let Tom help ?
This is not a hospital .
My uncle has been dead for three years .
He is still young .
Tom never expected to walk again .
He &apos;s your father .
I haven &apos;t seen her since last month .
Tom gave away all his money .
Tom often helps others .
My parents are out of town .
I don &apos;t want Tom to do that .
You are what you eat .
Look at what I made .
I &apos;m no longer tired .
It &apos;s business .
I think you &apos;re working way too hard .
I had no idea that you were coming .
It &apos;ll be over soon .
Tom took his own life .
Being very tired , I went to bed early .
That wasn &apos;t your fault .
Why are you pretending you don &apos;t know me ?
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Why is everybody afraid of Tom ?
She is his friend .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing .
What &apos;ll you do there ?
How long did you work for Tom ?
All of us like her .
Tom &apos;s died .
I don &apos;t love you .
I got you something .
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
Here &apos;s your beer .
They wouldn &apos;t let anyone talk to me .
You &apos;d better go now .
Tom asked Mary why she didn &apos;t want to go to Australia with John .
Tom gave me a dictionary .
Why didn &apos;t Tom come ?
I know how to read French .
Tom is not able to swim .
Why do you want to buy this book ?
Do you want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
Girls talk too much .
It is difficult to speak three languages .
I &apos;m bigger than you .
Could you give me a lift to the train station ?
Tom worked very hard .
This morning the weather was so bad that I had to take a taxi .
Did Tom call you ?
We could go there now .
I have to show you something .
Your problems don &apos;t concern me .
Mary is Tom &apos;s daughter .
&quot; What did you say ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say anything . &quot;
You &apos;ll find a job .
It won &apos;t stop raining .
Tom isn &apos;t so tall .
Tom held the door open for Mary .
People say that he &apos;s still alive .
It helped me a lot .
I would never say that .
Tom is history .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave Australia .
Speaking English isn &apos;t easy .
They say they know you .
Tom and I are friends .
You should ask a doctor .
I can &apos;t solve this problem . It &apos;s too difficult for me .
Tom doesn &apos;t do things like that .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
I have one of those , too .
What do you mean by that ?
The car &apos;s parked opposite that building .
Tom will do anything we want him to do .
She may have known the answer .
I &apos;d do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t want to dance anymore .
You &apos;re a little too young for me .
I &apos;m not listening to you .
It was my first job .
I will deal with him myself .
You alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
I won &apos;t tolerate such language !
Tom knows some French .
It &apos;s a secret , I guess .
Tom isn &apos;t welcome here .
I &apos;ve never had a friend quite like you .
I think it &apos;s somewhere around here .
How would you like your eggs ?
Does Tom have more than one girlfriend ?
I &apos;m sick of talking about it .
You didn &apos;t tell me that Tom speaks French .
Where will we eat ?
People say that life is short .
Where did Tom see you ?
You ought to have told me that before .
I &apos;m so glad you called .
I told Tom what happened .
Tom died just as he was trying to say something to Mary .
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to see what would happen . &quot;
Wait a second .
I haven &apos;t seen him in a few days .
I &apos;ll explain .
It &apos;s my job to help people like you .
Tom felt lucky .
He slammed his door shut .
It &apos;s not like it used to be .
Tom saw Mary on TV .
I don &apos;t care what you want .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
I can &apos;t talk to girls .
You &apos;re right , as usual .
This is the first time I &apos;ve ever disagreed with Tom .
I need somebody .
I love my daughter .
That &apos;s enough .
Tom isn &apos;t going to come home .
Tom says he isn &apos;t giving up .
I &apos;m very hungry .
You look handsome .
This isn &apos;t funny .
Tom can &apos;t live without a TV .
I didn &apos;t think that was any fun .
I &apos;m with him .
She lives in a large house .
I missed the bus .
Tom is hammered .
I thought Tom was interested .
She wished to be beautiful .
Where &apos;s the train station ?
Please don &apos;t try this at home .
What did you make ?
We &apos;ve only been married for three years .
How did you see that ?
Can we afford that ?
Tom seldom speaks to Mary anymore .
He had one daughter .
Tom has never been late for school .
It shouldn &apos;t matter .
These people are my friends .
I got what I wanted .
Tom sometimes walks to work .
I should call a doctor .
Tom is going to be thirty next year .
He is a good student .
My children don &apos;t speak French yet .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
There are only three girls in the class .
He made mistake after mistake .
Tom read the book Mary gave him .
It &apos;s about time you went to bed .
When did Tom get married ?
Tom kept quite calm .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
This isn &apos;t my first time to be here .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his glasses .
We don &apos;t like it .
He kept talking .
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
Please answer this question for me .
Tom is never going to ever forget Mary .
How do you know all these things ?
We won &apos;t stand a chance .
Nobody asked Tom .
Is there anyone who can answer ?
Tom is not as old as you .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to be interested .
I will stay until tomorrow .
I must have made a mistake .
Why do you have to go ?
Tom isn &apos;t here yet , but we expect him soon .
Cheer up !
This has to wait until tomorrow .
What &apos;s your favorite city in the United States ?
I love you all the more for your faults .
My father reads the newspaper every morning .
What did you say ? I can &apos;t hear you .
Tom is fine .
Tom is in his room now .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d enjoy doing that .
Just follow my lead .
Tom speaks French very well .
The new film was a great success .
Nobody tells the truth anymore .
Be careful . I don &apos;t want you to hurt yourself .
This doesn &apos;t involve you .
You would love it .
I can &apos;t figure out why nobody comes here anymore .
Now my daughter is afraid of me .
I wish Tom were dead .
I will say something about it .
We &apos;ve already started .
I have a little money now .
We only have tea .
It &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
They have been busy .
Isn &apos;t that what we anticipated ?
I hope that &apos;s not true .
Please let me try it again .
Tom must leave now .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
Tom absolutely deserves it .
It &apos;s too hot .
What happened here ?
I must say something .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what happened .
He &apos;s a friend from work .
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary had come to Boston .
I was waiting for a taxi .
Did anyone tell Tom ?
Tom bought something for Mary .
What are we going to do about this ?
Tom is proud of his family .
You must quit drinking .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve found you .
Tom likes running .
He was very nervous .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
I think that I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
I can &apos;t think of any place I &apos;d rather be .
Nobody loves me .
I &apos;m proud of my brother .
She begged him not to go there .
It &apos;s enough for five days .
People ask me that all the time .
You &apos;re the only person who ever comes to visit me .
Tom could do this .
I like tennis .
I said we &apos;ll get one .
I &apos;d like to show this picture of Tom to you .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
You might be right .
They want us to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t have to eat that if he didn &apos;t want to .
Tom was angry with his wife .
He told me to meet him at the restaurant .
He has big problems .
Tom can &apos;t understand French .
I believe that Tom expects too much from us .
I bought a camera for 30 dollars .
The floor was cold .
Nobody &apos;ll know .
Tell me the reason why you want to live in the countryside .
I love you more than anyone else .
You seem tired . You should go to bed .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to go .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re staying .
She is listening to him .
I &apos;m glad you like it .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
I was able to help her .
You like everyone .
He &apos;s already too far away to hear us .
That book is mine .
How long did you work for Tom ?
There are a great many books in this library .
My hands were full .
There &apos;s no need to speak so loud .
I think Tom is awake .
The boy has no food .
They are talking about what they will sing .
Both Tom and Mary want to study French .
I hope the bus will come before long .
She &apos;s much better today .
Can Tom come , too ?
Tom can &apos;t swim yet .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom to do that .
I believe that &apos;s correct .
Give me the key .
I know Tom is fine .
How many times do I have to explain this to you ?
I want to tell her the truth .
It was cold yesterday .
After school , Tom usually sticks around as long as he can because he doesn &apos;t want to go home .
He has much more money than I have .
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
We just weren &apos;t good enough .
There are a lot of people who can &apos;t do that .
How many apples do you have ?
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
You can &apos;t imagine doing that , can you ?
Do you have any further questions ?
Tom wants to be like me .
I &apos;ll show you around the city .
It &apos;s a big world .
What are you going to be doing with that ?
What do you think I should &apos;ve done ?
I never thought it could happen to me .
What were you doing when I called this morning ?
You can &apos;t go back there .
I &apos;m learning French now .
The weather &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t mind sleeping on the floor .
You never say what you really think .
Doesn &apos;t that just make you angry ?
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to do that .
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on the way to work .
You should not rely on others .
We meet sometimes at the shop .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
That &apos;s all going to change .
We must not go to war again .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary was reading .
My eyes hurt .
You must apologize to Tom .
I took the book .
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
Are you happy with that ?
Do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
Tom wants to speak .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
Tell me what to do with it .
Did you do this on your own ?
I &apos;m three years older than you .
I &apos;m glad you invited me .
I knew you &apos;d like that .
I want to talk to the police .
She mistook me for my sister .
Tom said he &apos;d be right back .
I &apos;m not in trouble .
I wonder why it &apos;s so crowded here today .
I got angry .
Did you watch this movie ?
We went dancing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary went to Boston .
Do you have anything else to say ?
I &apos;d like to tell her that I love her .
I hope we &apos;re not too late .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer the last question .
It looks as if it is going to rain .
Tom says Boston is really cold now .
It &apos;s good to have you with us .
They are proud of their daughter .
Tom caught a fish .
We can speak French .
We &apos;re not going to do that again .
Tom could barely speak .
My father may be at home now .
I &apos;ll always love you .
You &apos;re strong .
Can I ask why this is so important to you ?
We have to help Tom .
Did Tom hurt himself ?
Tom isn &apos;t like me .
You must read this book .
It &apos;s time for bed .
Let me help you with that .
I heard everything .
She &apos;s been absent from school for five days .
He &apos;ll be back soon .
You know what it &apos;s like .
We need to go visit Tom in the hospital .
Is this what you want ?
You &apos;re stupid .
Tom is going to dump Mary .
I wish you &apos;d said that before .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom .
It &apos;s beyond me .
Tom is the one with the car , not me .
Tom had other things on his mind .
How many eggs could you get yesterday ?
Have you written to Tom ?
She spoke relatively quickly .
Tom says he still has no idea where Mary is .
She is too young to know the truth .
He lives with his mom .
I need to know where you are .
I have no idea of what to do .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to understand .
Tom gave us nothing .
I want to keep my car there .
Here &apos;s the bus .
Do you want to read ?
I &apos;m going to bed .
Tom said that he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself .
I &apos;m glad we saw Tom .
They wear very little clothing .
Did you hear what Tom said about Mary ?
Tom saw everything .
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle ?
I just can &apos;t do it .
We want Tom to go home .
Don &apos;t talk about work . We &apos;re on vacation .
Tom was very busy all day .
Tom did it right away .
What can you tell me about this ?
You can stay with us .
Tom didn &apos;t want the job .
Who is standing there ?
Tom said that doing that was a mistake and that he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
We have an understanding .
We don &apos;t have to be here .
Give me your phone number .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
What made you think Tom hasn &apos;t done that ?
Here are our books .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
The question was too difficult to answer .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear me .
Tom blames Mary for everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t see it like that .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
You have only three minutes left .
Tom must not find out the truth .
I didn &apos;t want to speak to anyone .
I see a girl standing under that tree .
I hear from her once in a while .
Tom is no longer my boyfriend .
I &apos;ll pay for it myself .
Would you like some coffee ?
Tom &apos;s parents are older than mine .
I can &apos;t stay for dinner .
Why did you buy the flowers ?
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
You are really very good .
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
Please mail this letter for me .
How did that happen ?
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
I like coming to Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t want to lose his wife .
She was too proud to ask him for help .
Won &apos;t you stay for tea ?
She has gone to America .
I &apos;d rather not do this anymore .
What else can you do ?
The boys were injured .
I just want to win .
I think that you ought to apologize to her .
He came to ask us to help him .
It has to be done .
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Tom &apos;s wife just died .
Is your father a doctor ?
We definitely need Tom &apos;s help .
I saw Tom coming .
Is this the train station ?
Anywhere with a bed will do .
Has this ever happened to you before ?
Can you cook well ?
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
There &apos;s no film in this camera .
He is the last man to do such a thing .
I can &apos;t believe how beautiful you are .
Admit it , we &apos;re lost .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I &apos;ll never be like Tom .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
It &apos;s too long .
I can &apos;t quite understand .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand any French .
Tom was extremely helpful .
Tom has a right to know .
Is everybody all right ?
We weren &apos;t invited to the party .
I &apos;d rather not know .
He has already gone home .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
The sun sets earlier in the winter .
I have to study French .
Who has it now ?
I have to get my computer repaired .
It &apos;s different .
Tom saw Mary with John .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
Will you help me for a minute ?
It &apos;s up to me .
I have a boyfriend who loves me .
Let &apos;s go grab a cup of coffee .
I was stupid to make a mistake like that .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you and Tom .
I &apos;m very tired .
Tom knows Mary pretty well .
He does not listen .
I felt that I should help her .
You are not a child any more .
What is it like ?
We were not to blame for the accident .
You &apos;d better not speak .
Do you still have feelings for her ?
Tom is sure to win .
Are you busy on Sunday afternoon ?
I saw Tom in there .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
Tom said you stole my money .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston three years ago .
It &apos;s too late now .
Do you know where your children are ?
I don &apos;t hate anyone .
I had a very good time today .
Let &apos;s go dancing .
I made a lot of mistakes .
Did you hear something ?
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
It is easy to answer this question .
It was nothing .
I &apos;ve found something I &apos;d like to show you .
I want to help you .
I helped .
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
How old do I look ?
He doesn &apos;t earn enough money to live on .
Do you know how to do that ?
What is in the box ?
I just found it .
Did Tom find you ?
I don &apos;t like to talk about my problems .
Tom said that Mary likes you .
You know what I mean .
Tom lives here .
She took off her old shoes and put on the new ones .
Here you are .
Could you please give this to Tom ?
Who are we ?
You never say what you really think .
Tom is so nice .
I always thought Tom and Mary would get married .
How long are they ?
Let &apos;s go out and eat dinner together from time to time .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
The good news is that we don &apos;t have to go .
Tom is a very good cook .
He may come today .
Tom has what we all want .
We &apos;ve found something .
Tom had an accident .
My mother tells me I have to go to bed by ten o &apos;clock on school nights .
I &apos;m really happy for you , Tom .
I &apos;ve been alone for a long time .
Tom couldn &apos;t afford to buy the bicycle he wanted .
It had to be done .
Tom is a good boy .
Why is this computer so slow ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good teacher .
Tom and Mary are the same height .
Tom and Mary want to see us .
Tom met Mary on his way to school .
Can I get your help with something ?
Where is the railway station ?
Do you know why ?
In this company , there are more women than men .
I have a passport .
I wrote her a letter every day .
Have you heard from him ?
This clock gains two minutes a day .
You had better stop smoking .
Fewer people come here every year .
I didn &apos;t finish reading that book .
I remember what he said .
Tom has left for good .
All my friends have children .
Tom , it &apos;s not your fault .
That cake looks good .
I ate lunch with Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t wearing shoes .
Tom wanted you to see it right away .
The teacher has three times as many books as I do .
We have to stop this .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
Please let me sleep .
Let &apos;s talk over a cup of coffee .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
He did it himself .
I don &apos;t have the time to help you right now .
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
I only hope it is not too late .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t sick .
May I go to bed ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t want anything to drink .
I was planning on telling you today .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
My mother is making dinner .
How far is it from the airport to the hotel ?
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
He thinks I &apos;m in love with her .
Please give me some water .
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon .
I never thought I &apos;d say this .
You &apos;re only three years older than me .
That one &apos;s good .
Tom made these for you .
I know your brother .
It is impossible to do it .
Can you play a song for me ?
Tom is gravely ill .
Tom certainly should have kept his promise .
A beautiful woman like you shouldn &apos;t be eating alone .
I &apos;d like to see your father .
The man who came to visit you didn &apos;t say who he was .
Tom loves being outdoors .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
Nobody had anything else to say .
Tom might not be as hungry as you think he is .
What &apos;s your problem ?
I hear you .
Whose phone number is this ?
We want you here .
I &apos;m going to bed early today .
Tom wants to see you in his office .
I &apos;m glad I was able to help you last week .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
He often falls in love .
Tom isn &apos;t as busy as he seems to be .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
I think we &apos;d better be going .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told me that .
What do you mean by that ?
Don &apos;t give the dog anything to eat .
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
I want to hear what you have to say .
Tom gave Mary a drink .
All I care about is the truth .
I saw Tom again .
She has a daughter whose name is Mary .
No one is allowed to go there .
Perhaps he will come .
I think that what you need now is to eat something .
I &apos;ve never told anyone .
I &apos;ve got the keys .
I know the girl .
How about tomorrow night ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t go there by himself .
We learn French at school .
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
No one believes him .
Tom &apos;s life is in danger .
Who &apos;s better at French , Tom or Mary ?
I want him to leave .
Tom works every day except Sunday .
How can I get to heaven ?
Did Tom talk to you ?
I wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
Tom and Mary are friends of my family .
I changed clothes .
How are things at home ?
Your question is very hard to answer .
What are you going as ?
We &apos;ve lived in this town for three years .
They are very far away .
I &apos;ll be doing that with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary expects from him .
I &apos;d like to live in Boston .
What do you want to do in the afternoon ?
What does that tell us ?
She is about my age .
You won &apos;t need that .
He spends a great deal of money on books .
Tom needs time .
Tom is out of work .
What &apos;s this doing here ?
The door was hard to open .
I would like to show you my beautiful city .
Tom often doesn &apos;t keep his promises .
I &apos;m not well .
She doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
Tom is coming over this evening .
Where did you see the woman ?
You should know that &apos;s impossible .
You can &apos;t believe a word of it .
Mary said that she wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s daughter .
I &apos;ll be with you in a few minutes .
Do you have any more questions ?
I wasn &apos;t drunk .
You can &apos;t dance , can you ?
Tom &apos;s not home yet .
I think it &apos;s the best way .
Everyone knows that he &apos;s still alive .
I &apos;m a little hurt .
Tom has lots of things he has to do .
I love his son .
We only have one day left .
She is already married .
I enjoy your company .
Tom had problems in school .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
I think I &apos;m crazy .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
I know what I know .
How was your summer ?
I am looking forward to seeing you next Sunday .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
Here &apos;s my passport .
I don &apos;t agree with you .
Do you really think you can run as fast as me ?
I haven &apos;t heard from him for a long time .
I didn &apos;t know you had a girlfriend .
I like the way you think .
I know it well .
They know I know .
We &apos;ll fix this .
We must move quickly .
I think you can help us .
Tom said that nothing had happened .
I &apos;m coming .
We &apos;re still not allowed to visit Tom .
I usually agree with her .
You must not go there with them .
I will be with you right away .
Summer seems to have come at last .
Do you want me to tell you why ?
I used to play here as a child .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
Tom sat down on the bench next to me .
She sat on the bench .
How do you view this matter ?
I &apos;ve got to do my homework now .
There are just two of us .
Where did he learn this ?
I can &apos;t show you this .
Do whatever you like .
It helped me a lot .
How did you see that ?
Do you want to know or not ?
Tom said you were hungry .
Why couldn &apos;t you do that ?
I heard what happened .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough time to finish his homework .
I want Tom to live .
I feel sorry for the children .
Where &apos;s your key ?
What are you guys doing ?
Tom is one of Mary &apos;s best friends .
Tom &apos;s not in the hospital .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car yet .
I haven &apos;t heard this song in a long time .
I don &apos;t want to be like that .
It &apos;s raining .
I wonder what will happen .
Do you want me to help you with your homework ?
I &apos;m pretty sure it was Tom that I saw .
Could you solve the problem ?
You don &apos;t want this .
How many people work here ?
Where is the cat ?
I can &apos;t do it anymore .
Everybody likes you .
What happens to me isn &apos;t important .
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;ll have to go home now .
Can you stay with Tom ?
They were all surprised to see me there .
I don &apos;t know why Tom &apos;s doing that .
I dislike being alone .
She wasn &apos;t able to explain this situation to me .
I don &apos;t feel like dancing .
You &apos;re not as important as you think you are .
Have you ever seen this movie before ?
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
Who are you coming with ?
I need you .
I only know how to play one song on the guitar .
You &apos;re the woman I love .
Where &apos;re Tom &apos;s things ?
You can wear anything you want .
I have too many things on my mind these days .
My children don &apos;t listen to me .
My family is small .
You have nothing to lose .
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
I don &apos;t know anybody here , except Tom .
Could you give me a few more minutes ?
What about having fish for dinner ?
I find it hard to understand Tom .
&quot; Tom &apos;s death was an accident . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll do that .
You have no choice in this matter .
I want this .
I give you my word on it .
My dad &apos;s name is Tom .
He lives there alone .
We must deal with the problem instantly .
Let Tom have his turn .
What is it now ?
I come from a big family .
This is a picture of the first car I owned .
I want you to come with me .
Take your time with it .
What have you been doing ?
I prefer coffee to tea .
Where is everybody ?
In my opinion , she is correct .
This is all entirely my fault .
There are too many things to do !
Can you tell me what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
We &apos;re not leaving you here .
I thought I knew everything .
We do what we have to .
That would take about three minutes .
Why are you so happy ?
I want very much for you to understand .
That boy looks like you .
Is this love ?
I came looking for you .
Please wait here .
I will learn .
I don &apos;t think I understand .
You should ask Tom yourself .
Tom speaks no French .
Somebody is playing the piano .
We both know you don &apos;t live where you say you do .
He is unable to do it .
I don &apos;t eat that much .
We want Tom .
It is time to go .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
I asked my friend for advice .
What are you doing here ?
Tom has been dead for three years .
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Boston .
The point is that they are hungry .
Is that Tom &apos;s house ?
Tom really should speak French .
Tom is allowed to do that .
He gave me a ride home .
We are happy .
I just wanted to say thank you .
My hair is too long .
I &apos;m being good to you this morning .
Tom doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s such a big deal .
I know what that &apos;s like .
Like father , like son .
Tom rarely gets angry .
There is always something happening here .
It &apos;s entirely my fault .
Tom can &apos;t get in touch with Mary .
Let me do that for you .
My father works for a bank .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
We were sick .
Tom never asked questions .
How did it end ?
I bought a new car for Tom .
There &apos;s a telephone in my room .
Do you want these ?
She doesn &apos;t eat meat , does she ?
Is there a bank near here ?
What do you like most about Boston ?
We don &apos;t want to do that here .
The book is white .
These must be Tom &apos;s .
Someone is at the door .
Do you know what that guy &apos;s name is ?
That &apos;s how Tom did that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will visit Boston .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I only came to say I &apos;m sorry .
Nobody deserves that .
He speaks too fast .
Be a man .
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
Why aren &apos;t you going ?
What happened in Boston wasn &apos;t your fault .
You weren &apos;t there .
This car handles well .
It seems Tom &apos;s in love with me .
Are you still busy ?
Please read the whole story .
Nobody knows where it is .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever seen Tom do that .
Tom told me his father had been killed in the war .
I &apos;m sure Tom won &apos;t mind .
I had no work yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
Tom likes you very much .
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
I have a few questions .
I would like to see Tom .
Tom is a dad , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
There was an accident .
Tom left the book on the table .
I will give you this book .
I &apos;d like to talk about your situation .
She went out of the room .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is like .
Give me three weeks .
Could you please be quiet ?
I &apos;m so proud to know that she &apos;s mine .
I &apos;ll make you a drink .
Did you hear about Tom ?
Did you invite Tom to dinner without telling me ?
Tom understands what Mary wants him to do .
He was busy , but he took the time to show me around the city .
I know no one in this city .
Go back to your work .
What &apos;s Tom listening to ?
Tom &apos;s still a kid .
Tom is pretty nervous .
Is Tom around ?
You &apos;d better stop smoking .
This doesn &apos;t concern you , Tom .
I have something to give you .
I &apos;ll give these to you .
I don &apos;t know if it is good .
I have got to go now .
Tom should talk to me .
About how long will it take ?
Tom and Mary want to know what &apos;s going on .
This is for you .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been here today .
Tom speaks French well .
They were hungry .
Tom didn &apos;t see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
Tom wanted to learn how to swim .
How did you learn that Tom wasn &apos;t living in Boston ?
There were several rooms still vacant .
The work has already begun .
They love that .
We weren &apos;t doing anything !
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
Tom was very nice to me .
You can &apos;t drink here .
We were eating lunch together .
I met my friends yesterday .
That &apos;s the building where my father works .
Doing that wouldn &apos;t be right , would it ?
I &apos;m happy you &apos;re here .
We already know each other .
I &apos;ll call you up tomorrow morning .
I think we &apos;re going to be fine .
Why did you buy a car ?
You can stay here as long as you like .
Is your car new ?
I don &apos;t have a boyfriend .
Tom is your brother , isn &apos;t he ?
Let me hear your frank opinion .
I know Boston very well .
Don &apos;t pick up that phone .
I did what had to be done .
You and Tom are good friends , right ?
My sister doesn &apos;t have a car .
I could learn something from you , I think .
I don &apos;t think he will come .
Tom is in the hospital .
They &apos;re quiet .
I know there &apos;s a room available .
Why do you need to read such a book ?
Tom has lost his job .
Do you have a TV ?
Tom almost always gets home from school before 5 : 30 .
It should be possible .
I like you , too .
I &apos;ve been seeking an answer to your question .
Tom might be hungry .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
I don &apos;t understand what you are saying .
I ran away .
He is having dinner .
Tom and Mary know each other , but they &apos;re not exactly friends .
It &apos;s still not working .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that Mary is happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
Tom went there alone .
That won &apos;t help you .
We watch television every evening .
We should &apos;ve done this earlier .
Tom left without me .
Let &apos;s not wait for Tom any longer .
She &apos;s about the same height as you .
Why didn &apos;t you tell anyone ?
What do you want to eat ?
It doesn &apos;t matter when you come .
I want to go .
I know that you don &apos;t like me .
Nobody wants you to do that .
If you know what &apos;s good for you , you &apos;ll quit doing that .
Tom always helps us .
We only see each other on weekends .
Tom took off his glasses .
I &apos;m not in love with Mary .
I don &apos;t know why he was late .
I wanted to go there .
I &apos;ll handle everything .
No one could buy anything .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing .
Tom got up early .
We &apos;re crazy about each other .
Tom is expected to come home soon .
I don &apos;t know that guy &apos;s name .
Tom got a letter from Mary today .
Tom said that he thought the room was too small .
It took her all afternoon to finish the work .
I &apos;m coming for you .
This is all the money that I have now .
There &apos;s no beer here .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary .
My dog follows me wherever I go .
Tom didn &apos;t stay in Australia .
You &apos;re not telling me the whole truth .
He is a good match for me .
They &apos;ll never make it .
This is the problem .
My cat is happy .
How old are you ?
Tom can sing quite well .
I &apos;m going to be late .
That &apos;s how it is done .
&quot; I &apos;m not in love with Tom anymore . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
Tom wasn &apos;t able to do what he wanted to do .
Is this your suitcase ?
I heard what you said to Tom at school .
Is there a restaurant close by ?
What did that suggest to you ?
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
Why are you looking at me ?
He did it willingly .
There is a cat .
I don &apos;t understand girls at all .
We &apos;re lucky Tom isn &apos;t here with us .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve spoken French .
I went on reading .
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
I was at Tom &apos;s place yesterday .
I remember her .
I don &apos;t have anything to give to you .
I don &apos;t know his name .
Tom should tell Mary that .
A car &apos;s coming .
Do you think Tom is really sorry ?
He does not know how to solve the problem .
Tom is better looking than you .
What do you want to do about Tom ?
I will speak to him alone .
You do understand me , don &apos;t you ?
Tom likes helping others .
That &apos;s not safe .
I used to be pretty good at this .
It &apos;s all over now .
He has come a long way .
You can &apos;t do this .
That is quite possible .
What can you tell me about it ?
Can I ask why ?
Tom now lives in Australia .
I was very busy yesterday .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
This problem is too difficult for me to solve .
Tom is going to buy a new computer .
I cannot understand what you say .
Why don &apos;t you like me ?
No one is home .
I know who you are .
That &apos;s a promise .
Tom didn &apos;t tell everyone .
I just don &apos;t want to lose you .
How do you think we can help Tom ?
I will have finished the work by eight o &apos;clock .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
I want to stay here longer .
Did you invite him ?
It wouldn &apos;t be too difficult .
I know how women think .
Please tell me this isn &apos;t true .
You ought to know better .
He will be back in a couple of days .
I &apos;d like to see you if possible .
I &apos;ll give you what you want .
Tom looked toward Mary .
You &apos;re not going to make me drink alone , are you ?
What do you do on Sunday ?
I am afraid that it will rain .
They &apos;re not talking .
I am quite satisfied .
She &apos;d never been so frightened .
She &apos;s pleased with her new dress .
Love will find a way .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe she can tell you more .
I don &apos;t know him very well .
Tom is about the same age as you are .
Tom should &apos;ve studied harder .
This is good meat .
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday .
How long has she been sick ?
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon .
I have to work tomorrow .
Mary asked me to pretend to be her boyfriend .
Tom was drunk and he said some things he shouldn &apos;t have .
It &apos;ll stop raining soon .
Tom asked me to do it .
Can I see that ?
We see each other every day .
Tom has done that .
We got to the station at six .
She looked as if she hadn &apos;t eaten in days .
May I speak to you alone ?
It was impossible to understand his questions .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
I can &apos;t read Tom &apos;s mind .
I am very happy with it .
Where can I buy books ?
I &apos;m going to my sister &apos;s .
You should listen to him .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
I &apos;m not that surprised by it .
Nothing can be done about it .
See you next week !
Tom wanted to go to Australia .
I &apos;d rather go hungry than eat this .
They need to find an apartment in the city .
Tom needed money .
Where did you meet my father ?
Tom slept on the sofa .
He may have missed the train .
They let me go .
Have you eaten the cake yet ?
Tom and Mary are out .
He doesn &apos;t care about money .
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive ?
He is old enough to drive .
Tom is wanted by the police .
I wonder what Tom thinks of me .
We love having Tom back .
Tom may change .
What are you doing ?
You must remain calm .
Tom is sleeping .
Tom told me that he &apos;d like to become a doctor .
I met a friend of mine at the airport .
Did your uncle let you drive his car ?
I may go to Boston next month .
I gave the dog two pieces of meat .
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom ate all the bread that I bought yesterday .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom alone .
We have to be very careful .
No one understands you like I do .
It wasn &apos;t very fun .
I can swim as well as you .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
Every time I see you , I think of your mother .
She is quick at everything .
I hate Mondays .
That &apos;s what I think .
Do you really want Tom to do this for you ?
That &apos;s a hard question to answer .
Tom came to Boston to visit Mary .
Tom and I are the same age .
I haven &apos;t walked to school in a long time .
You are in need of a holiday .
Tom looks like his mother .
Is this your wine ?
I wish it didn &apos;t have to be like this .
Tom had no idea of what was going on .
Tom lives with his parents .
Tom was happily married .
It &apos;s only Monday .
Can the matter wait till tomorrow ?
One must keep one &apos;s promises .
Tom looked miserable .
I love this car .
I forgot what I was going to say .
What &apos;s the best way to get there ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
We play games together .
Tom is imitating the teacher .
I know where to find water .
Today &apos;s the big day .
You can &apos;t let anyone else know .
We can count on Tom .
Tom is too busy .
Fish , please .
You &apos;re just in time for dinner .
Tom has to go home now .
There &apos;s nothing to lose .
You need not go there .
I don &apos;t remember who gave me this .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
How many more days will it take Tom to finish doing that ?
Tom bought himself a dog .
I &apos;ve been here for three days .
Tom wasn &apos;t looking for Mary , was he ?
I &apos;ll be by later .
Mary hasn &apos;t received the flowers yet .
Much as I &apos;d like to come , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll be too busy .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything in six days .
What kind of dog is it ?
Tom can help me .
That &apos;s how I like it .
You can go home now .
I like studying French .
He likes to watch TV .
Tom was working at his desk all morning .
You can have either of these , but not both .
Did you give Tom my phone number ?
I feel like another beer .
Tom can &apos;t afford to get married .
It &apos;s raining again !
Tom opposed the plan .
What do you want to say ?
Tom and Mary have nothing to do .
Who &apos;s after you ?
That &apos;s our house .
I like that answer .
They &apos;re now alone .
I wondered why Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Are you all alone ?
Tom took his goggles off .
This work is by no means easy .
She went from one shop to another .
This one is ours .
Do you have a bike ?
I know where to look for Tom .
You know it &apos;s not good .
I forgot to buy a gift for you .
Children are our future .
Tom put himself and his children at risk .
Tom is still alive .
Thank you for the book .
I &apos;m sure Tom wouldn &apos;t mind doing that .
Tom will pay for what he did .
Tom needs to remain in bed .
Did Tom talk to Mary ?
Could you bring me something to eat ?
She &apos;s not my type .
Did you like this book ?
Tom knows what to say .
I have it at home .
Can he do this job ?
We &apos;ll stay here .
I think it &apos;ll rain today .
Tom is in Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom died before Mary was born .
Go on , Tom , I &apos;m listening .
Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
What do you have ?
Tom paid a lot of money for that guitar .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
I don &apos;t know who did it .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
We speak French .
We &apos;re giving up .
Let &apos;s play this game again .
Nobody knows why .
Tom gave me all his money .
How is the family ?
Tom isn &apos;t as strong as before .
Have you ever written a book ?
Tom will be back home soon .
My children can &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;ll take it home with me .
Why isn &apos;t the ship moving ?
It &apos;s a short walk .
Tom didn &apos;t even know I was here .
I know you aren &apos;t that stupid .
Tom looks nice .
He won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
I thought that was my job .
We need to be more like Tom .
I don &apos;t know if I should believe Tom or not .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
Where did you find your key ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want anything to drink .
Tom needs more .
We know what happened last weekend .
It doesn &apos;t concern you .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice wasn &apos;t beautiful .
It was just stupid .
I didn &apos;t have to study yesterday .
I suppose I shouldn &apos;t be surprised .
Here , drink this .
I said I saw Tom .
Tom wanted me to drive .
That wasn &apos;t your fault .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the reason .
I was worried for nothing .
Tom goes to work by bus .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be back before long .
What does that look like to you ?
I get by .
Tom is his name , I think .
What time does Tom leave for work ?
The door slammed shut .
What &apos;s the name of your ship ?
Tom likes spending time in the garden .
You should let Tom win .
Tom didn &apos;t have to go to work today .
I remember Tom well .
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make another mistake .
I have homework .
I &apos;m not worried about it at all .
I didn &apos;t see either boy .
They &apos;re after us .
What language was that ?
I think you &apos;ve hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
He &apos;s your father .
Let me have a look at it .
Excuse me . Where are the eggs ?
Would you like to hold my hand ?
I heard the door open .
I knew Tom would like it here .
I wanted to introduce myself .
What &apos;s her name ?
If you want to say something , go ahead and say it .
Tom seems afraid .
She may be proud of her daughter .
Tom said he enjoyed it .
We have had a lot of rain this summer .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
Tom looks exactly like his brother .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve ever told you , but you have beautiful eyes .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
Did you have a good time this afternoon ?
Give Tom his keys .
This house is not very large .
I &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re in danger .
I take back everything I &apos;ve said .
Your dress is very nice .
He &apos;s not allowed to leave the country .
I wish I could help you find a good job .
Tom was insane .
Who wants it ?
Please ask someone else .
Tom asked for some water .
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
I need a holiday .
It is especially hot today .
Where is my money ?
I saw how Tom was doing that .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like me .
Tom always tells me to drive carefully .
Tom opened his mouth wide .
What &apos;s going on with you ?
Tom and Mary are my children .
Tom takes the bus to work .
Tell Tom .
I can wait for you .
That was quick .
You need a key .
Tom had no one to tell his story to .
No one else knows it .
Tom is trying not to get in anybody &apos;s way .
Why would I want to help Tom ?
I &apos;ve got something I want to show you .
Tom is on his way to Australia .
I have got to go now .
Here &apos;s your lunch .
I &apos;ve been told I should do that again .
He did it right away .
That &apos;s my book .
Aren &apos;t you also from Boston ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
How did you do this ?
What do you want to do with it ?
I want to go home .
Is there anything else you would like to eat ?
Tom left earlier .
I don &apos;t know as many people as you do .
They &apos;re listening .
I just wanted to see what it was like .
You don &apos;t need that .
I sat down next to Tom .
I have no home .
Tom has many things he has to do today .
Tom wants three of them .
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
Tom says he knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
I want that more than anything .
I &apos;ll give you a book .
Tom knew what to do .
Tom reads slowly .
He seems to have been rich .
I was talking about it last night .
It &apos;s all Tom &apos;s .
Could you explain to me what happened ?
Did you see anybody there ?
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t do that ?
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
Do you remember when Tom said that ?
It &apos;s been three years since Tom left Boston .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how much Mary loves him .
I hope Tom is safe .
Who is calling , please ?
May I help you ?
Tom told Mary how he and John met .
I &apos;m not busy either .
Does Tom know how to cook ?
It &apos;s me !
I think that we should try again .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
I can &apos;t live without him .
Where did you get this money ?
No one will believe us .
Is Tom big ?
Tom is older than you think .
She likes to listen to music .
We don &apos;t have a daughter .
You didn &apos;t try hard enough .
You can have this .
Tom told me that you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
Tom wrote that Mary was in the hospital .
He can swim like a fish .
Where are you heading ?
I think we can be friends .
Tom might be early .
Where &apos;s your key ?
Not everyone &apos;s like you .
I hate Tom .
You need to help me .
Where is your friend ?
Listen carefully .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks .
That &apos;s why you pay us .
Tom is quite young .
My sister &apos;s going to kill me .
Tom will probably be frightened .
Do you want to go home now ?
I look like my father .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t think John did that with Alice .
My mom always says that she will visit me soon .
Tom is better .
Where &apos;s my horse ?
Did Tom find it ?
That &apos;s just impossible .
You won &apos;t die today .
You look just like him .
It doesn &apos;t fit .
Is there any other way I can pay you ?
Your father wants you .
I told Tom not to come .
Tom was sick .
The war was finally brought to a close .
I want to see Tom again .
I &apos;ll take it to Tom .
You don &apos;t have to use a dictionary when you read this book .
It &apos;s still a little early to eat lunch .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
What are you going to do about that ?
We know where it is .
She was my first girlfriend .
Tom seemed to have been very busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a lot to give .
I can &apos;t do it now .
I don &apos;t like her face .
I wasn &apos;t looking for anything .
It &apos;s hard to explain .
We &apos;ll discuss this problem later .
Who do you think will win ?
I can carry that for you .
I want to see you in my office this afternoon .
I don &apos;t believe that .
How many of you are there ?
He can swim very fast .
We &apos;ve found Tom .
Tom called us .
I haven &apos;t read all of these books .
I &apos;d rather not talk about it .
What does Tom have to say ?
I haven &apos;t had a reply to my letter .
I &apos;m busy right now and can &apos;t play with you .
It &apos;s too easy .
Here I come .
That computer doesn &apos;t work anymore .
I don &apos;t need to do that as often as I used to .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
I was asked if Tom could speak French .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Is your mother here ?
Where is the money , Tom ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom helping Mary ?
Tom told us he couldn &apos;t win .
I will be free tomorrow afternoon .
Tom went to the hospital yesterday .
Tom looked through the window at the street .
I don &apos;t want to hear it .
Breakfast is ready .
Can you speak French ?
Who did you go there with ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat meat anymore .
You &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I think it &apos;s a good idea .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom was a schoolteacher .
I have something else I need you to do .
Was Tom happy doing that ?
She did not keep her promise to write to me .
Tom says I look like a girl .
Why didn &apos;t you say it like that ?
How long is it ?
It &apos;s not a watch .
You could have been happy .
Do you want to know how ?
You will not be able to catch the train .
When was the last time you bought shoes ?
I know him by name .
There is a cat under the desk .
How many days are there in a week ?
I used to be like you .
Tom may go to Boston tomorrow .
Tom &apos;ll lose .
We have to buy it from abroad .
I am afraid it &apos;s too late .
You &apos;re not allowed to carry food into the library .
You don &apos;t have to do this .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
I like this book .
Why do we have to do that ?
Where do you think you are ?
Tom is as tall as me .
I can wait .
I think I &apos;m likeable .
I want that to happen .
What you &apos;ve heard about me isn &apos;t true .
That &apos;s the way we like it .
Tom told me what he wanted .
It was a beautiful night .
These girls are in trouble .
You wouldn &apos;t believe me if I told you .
They have very little to live on .
How did Tom manage to do that ?
When are you coming back to the office ?
Who &apos;s having a problem here , you or Tom ?
I &apos;m really happy for you .
I hadn &apos;t planned to do that , but I can if you really want me to .
Tom left home at 2 : 30 .
How many did you get ?
What could be the reason ?
I think he &apos;s happy .
He came back at 5 o &apos;clock .
Did you get Tom &apos;s message ?
Tom asked me to speak to you .
Why do I always have to do that ?
Can &apos;t you and Tom stay a little longer ?
Why did you start studying French ?
What are they doing out there ?
Where did you buy that ?
No one can help us .
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore .
I think I &apos;ve made a mistake .
Tom asked me to do that for him .
I have a right to be happy .
Come back soon .
He was so frightened that he ran for his life .
We have work to do .
Tom needs you here .
My son came to my room .
Tom became rich .
Why don &apos;t you say it ?
Tom went to bed .
Tom ate quickly .
How much money do you have on you ?
I was happy to do it , Tom .
Are you free ?
What do we have here ?
I like Boston a lot .
Suit yourself .
What makes people happy ?
Tom and Mary know each other , but they &apos;re not really friends .
I need to ask you some more questions .
She said that she was ill .
Why is everyone looking at us ?
I look forward to hearing from you soon .
Tom was a little surprised .
Did Tom really say that ?
His death surprised us all .
As far as I know , they are still together .
I just did what anybody would &apos;ve done .
I want to know why you did that .
I can only tell you what I know .
How is the family doing ?
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off Mary .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
Tom blamed it on me .
Are you with us ?
Tom knows some French .
Where did you learn this ?
She is writing a letter now .
I believe that the story is true .
We want to see Tom .
I &apos;m surprised you came at all .
I thought you said you worked here .
We don &apos;t have anything to eat .
Did you play tennis yesterday ?
Why don &apos;t you give Tom a chance ?
I was born in America .
I don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
I wish you had called thirty minutes ago .
I don &apos;t know if we can help Tom this time .
How are they doing this ?
She got into the car and drove off .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to tell you this , but he just lost his job .
I get on with him well .
Tom will be very proud of you .
Tom is sleeping .
Tom and I both need help .
Can &apos;t you just ask Tom to help us ?
He doesn &apos;t know English at all .
I can talk about anything with my best friend .
He is wearing a hat .
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
I am talking to my sister .
Tom &apos;s mother has died .
It seems that Tom can &apos;t swim .
You won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
I think they &apos;re happy .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was beautiful .
Tom was the last one to arrive here .
Do you really want to know the truth ?
This made me think of you .
You &apos;re Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building .
I now know it &apos;s possible .
Tom &apos;s family was also there .
Tom likes them .
I am able to swim across the river .
Do you want me to come ?
Let me know if you need anything .
Get it ready at once .
I haven &apos;t forgotten .
If anything happens here , can I depend on you ?
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to buy Mary for her birthday .
Tom wore a hat .
Why are you doing this to me ?
I received a letter from her .
You know why I left .
Tom worked for us for three years .
I just want to support you .
What is it you want , Tom ?
I almost had enough money to buy everything I needed .
Everyone in town knows his name .
It &apos;s good to be here .
Why are you planning on going home early today ?
I want people to see it .
I want to sleep a little longer .
Is this seat open ?
You have to go to the party .
That is exactly what I wanted to buy .
Is there anything else to eat ?
I still want to go .
I knew this moment would come .
We have three kids .
Let me talk .
I &apos;ve lost it .
He would often come to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that .
Tom isn &apos;t in .
We can still be friends .
You can go home if you like .
Tom goes to a different high school .
How is it possible ?
I lost it .
He &apos;s still at work .
They are not at all interested .
Tom saw a doctor .
How many hours did you work this week ?
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
I should like to go for a swim .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m doing this for you .
We don &apos;t have that long .
I &apos;m going to buy a camera for my daughter .
Tom never thought about the future .
We know Tom didn &apos;t do it .
I can &apos;t live without you .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
Tom never told me what happened .
We all know .
Tell them what happened .
What &apos;s it worth to you ?
You &apos;re going to love this book .
How did Tom pay for all this ?
Tom is very rich .
Tom lost his job last month .
Let Tom do it .
Turn it on .
Thank Tom for me .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
Tom can &apos;t hear anything .
Why should you want to do that ?
This is the happiest I &apos;ve ever been .
Can he speak English ?
This isn &apos;t going to be good .
You made it .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help me .
Where did you see her ?
Tom found something .
Tom is going to Boston next week for a meeting .
I have no idea what I &apos;m doing here .
I may not come .
Tom has been sick for the last three days .
Tom put Mary to bed .
I guess you don &apos;t remember me .
Tom wants to work .
She asked me how old I was .
Play it cool .
We get a lot of snow here in the winter .
She wanted to get married immediately .
His name eludes me .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
I already said that .
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
Tom fell .
You may ask any questions you wish .
I &apos;m supposed to wait for Tom .
Tom looked tired , but happy .
I asked him not to drive so fast .
He must be dead .
Tom &apos;s dog attacked Mary .
Do you remember who I am ?
Tom knows why Mary is here .
The building that I saw was very large .
Are you two happy ?
Things are very different today .
I must use this bike .
I used to work in Boston .
Who ate ?
I worked in Boston for three years .
The dog ran away from us .
You can see the whole city from here .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that again .
Tom found his key under the sofa .
Tom has already gone to bed .
She can &apos;t have done such a thing .
She is working on the problem .
The baby is sleeping on the bed .
Who has it ?
We &apos;re both very frightened .
We have a new problem .
A fish can swim .
You can say whatever you want .
That is a good idea .
I want to hear it from you .
This is my new guitar .
I know how angry you are .
There &apos;s still time .
Tom might be late .
That was all Tom said .
There wasn &apos;t anything I could do to help Tom .
Tom said this to me .
This would be a mistake .
What &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
I must be leaving now .
I want to know where it is .
You &apos;ve asked me that three times already .
How long have you known ?
How many people want to go swimming with us ?
Is one of you Tom ?
Tom , why are you doing this ?
It is not because I hate him , but because I love him .
I wonder if that &apos;s Tom .
How long have you lived here ?
Tom finished last .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
Tom asked for a glass of water .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
Take everything .
That will not be possible .
There is no milk left .
I knew it would make Tom happy .
You can &apos;t possibly be serious .
I have a son who &apos;s just turned three .
Don &apos;t ask so many questions .
They know who you are .
I was disappointed with your paper .
When are you going to quit smoking ?
Today wasn &apos;t a good day .
I can &apos;t find my glasses .
This is something you need to do alone .
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
I gave one to Tom , too .
Tom is my dad .
Tom never gets sick .
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
You have him there .
Tom is now in prison .
I don &apos;t have much money .
Tom never wrote Mary back .
Tom says he &apos;s on his way back home .
Tom watched TV all day .
Can it be true ?
He wasn &apos;t sleeping when I came home .
At what time will you be leaving ?
What did you do wrong ?
I don &apos;t like this place .
She is too young to go to school .
What &apos;s Tom going to say ?
I can &apos;t do this .
Did Tom go home ?
Tom gets angry very easily .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how it happened .
I don &apos;t speak any French .
I seldom speak to him .
I do not know if it is love .
Tom has a lot of money now .
Can I talk to Tom , please ?
I learned a lot .
I have no hair on my head .
He didn &apos;t get paid for it .
It &apos;s not a gift .
I don &apos;t like that idea much .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .
They don &apos;t want you to know .
Could you explain it to me again ?
If you &apos;d asked me for it , I would &apos;ve given it to you .
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
It &apos;s not stupid .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn &apos;t as hungry as everyone else .
You know what &apos;s about to happen , right ?
Are you sure about this ?
The movie was good .
Can somebody help me ?
Mary likes Japan , doesn &apos;t she ?
We won &apos;t forget .
This is different .
I want to know what love is .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice came here together .
Tom learned to swim last summer .
Tom isn &apos;t going to Boston .
You have no idea how to do this , do you ?
I think that he is right .
Tom is hard at work .
Maybe Tom gave it to Mary .
May I speak to you in private ?
Could you please take me back home ?
You don &apos;t have to go to the party unless you want to .
What are you doing tonight ?
Who was it that gave that to you ?
His hair was long last year .
Did you get a beer ?
Tom is still looking out the window .
We &apos;ll do what we have to do .
My parents live in the country .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do that again .
I &apos;m very worried about you .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
Are you through with the paper ?
That &apos;s not why .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
Tom has to finish this work by 2 : 30 .
I wish I were in Boston .
We &apos;ll work .
Anybody can make a mistake .
Where was it that you found this key ?
Do you want to know ?
Tom &apos;s new girlfriend is very young .
You &apos;re sure taking your time .
It &apos;s happening tonight .
They wouldn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He has a lot more money than I have .
Tom hardly ever talks .
Could you come and see me tomorrow ?
Tom made me go .
I will never forget this .
I &apos;m getting better every day .
How was today &apos;s game ?
Aren &apos;t you from Boston as well ?
It &apos;s too expensive .
We don &apos;t have to read that .
Everyone has to start somewhere .
She tried it herself .
I have just come here .
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
That &apos;s what you want to do , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom must be about thirty .
Hurry up .
It &apos;s nice to see Tom so happy .
Tom ate dinner about one hour ago .
Who is your friend ?
She looks like her mother .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d remember me .
I go to the beach almost every day .
I think everybody &apos;s here .
Tom is in his office .
Come swim with me .
I should &apos;ve known you &apos;d come back .
It &apos;s at home .
She kept me waiting for over an hour .
Tom has a lot of things he has to do .
I think I &apos;ve heard this song before .
Tom eats a lot .
Tom isn &apos;t so old that he can &apos;t work .
Tom eventually told the truth .
Anything &apos;s possible .
Well , how did that happen anyway ?
You shouldn &apos;t speak so ill of him .
It is easy to play tennis .
He seemed to like that .
Tom is coming for dinner .
I like going to the movies .
I enjoy being a teacher .
I understand that you and Tom are planning to get married .
They have what they want .
You only live once .
He has a test next week .
Tom doesn &apos;t look very happy .
I think he is right .
I &apos;ve been here for three hours .
She was at a loss for words .
Why aren &apos;t you here ?
I need you to drive me to the station .
Tom knows a man who lives in Boston .
Did Tom ever hurt you ?
What does this do ?
Tom said that he &apos;ll look after me .
Tom is well paid .
I hope you know what this is .
This is probably Tom &apos;s bicycle .
We &apos;ll go see Tom .
You don &apos;t have to tell it to me if you don &apos;t want to .
You have a car , don &apos;t you ?
He took something out of his pocket .
Tom isn &apos;t there .
This might not be enough .
Take it easy !
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions now .
Everybody knows who you are .
He may not be happy .
Tom has things to do .
You need help .
He &apos;s a good boy .
I know I &apos;m right .
My bike was stolen yesterday .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Tom is busy this afternoon .
Come again .
Let me buy you a new one .
How much is an apple ?
How do you live like this ?
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary the truth in the first place .
He has stopped smoking .
This train is made up of seven cars .
Tom said you wouldn &apos;t go .
Tom and Mary eat lunch together every day .
Tom came home .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He just arrived .
Tom came outside .
I have almost no money with me .
There has been no rain here for the past two weeks .
I have no one to go to for advice .
I know his name .
Did you meet her ?
Have you received an answer to your letter ?
I &apos;m married to Tom .
I lost the watch that my father gave me .
I &apos;m really happy I ran into you .
What are you girls doing ?
Tom wants to be at home .
Tom said he &apos;d do that for Mary .
I must be going now .
When is it convenient for you ?
Tom and Mary are happy together .
The book fell to the floor .
The man ate bread .
Tom asked Mary to open the window , but she wouldn &apos;t .
I was just thinking aloud .
You seemed to enjoy doing that .
Tom is here with me .
Tom has really taught me many things .
It looks like Tom likes his new job .
Why are we here again ?
I just want to be loved .
We don &apos;t really have to talk about this right now , do we ?
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve .
I have fewer students in my class this year than last year .
She has faults , too .
Can you play guitar ?
You should not go alone .
We &apos;re still here .
I don &apos;t understand this .
It would be better to try .
She has no one to talk to .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
It &apos;s so simple .
No one &apos;s going to do that .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only one not sitting .
Tom loves this .
I don &apos;t want to open the window .
Tom had no idea how Mary was feeling .
That house is mine .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
Hand it to Tom .
You ought to write a book .
Why would Tom want to help us ?
You can say what you like .
You &apos;re so young .
Are you hungry ?
I wonder why Tom killed himself .
I can &apos;t listen to this anymore .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom is the one who wants to wait .
There are a lot of people in the park .
Do you want to see this ?
Do you want to see ?
Tom said that he thought that the room was too small .
Here &apos;s Tom &apos;s picture .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; .
Tom seems to be waiting for somebody .
Do you know what it is ?
I thought I heard you .
I never asked for this .
&quot; Where is my phone ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on my desk . &quot;
I wish there was more I could &apos;ve done .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
It was still there .
Have you heard from your sister lately ?
He hit me on the head .
That &apos;s not always the case .
Will you let Tom leave ?
How will I find it ?
I wanted to stay home .
I &apos;ll let you know .
You can stay only if you &apos;re quiet .
Why do you want to study abroad ?
I arrived later than usual .
Tom has been very kind to us .
Are you in danger ?
I do it because I like to do it .
Everyone is very proud of you .
Tom said he knew Mary .
I &apos;m going to come .
How do we explain this to the kids ?
I only need two of these .
Has your father arrived yet ?
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
I just can &apos;t help .
You &apos;re so right .
I have to go to Boston with Tom .
All the students look up to him .
How do you like Australia ?
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
How do we do that ?
This isn &apos;t about us .
Nobody went there .
She has never been in love .
You have to come with us .
Your hair is too long .
I hope it stays that way .
She lives in this house by herself .
He gave me what I needed .
Tom is already here .
I prefer cats to dogs .
You certainly have a lot of questions .
These books aren &apos;t for children .
I am busy today .
I still love him .
Tom wasn &apos;t tired .
I hate her now .
How many years have you been studying French ?
I don &apos;t understand it .
I &apos;ll be in Boston .
Tom wasn &apos;t scared .
Who &apos;s here ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom coming ?
Tom has been in Australia for three years .
Nobody wants to talk about that .
I &apos;m likely to do that soon .
I don &apos;t have a car , but my sister does .
Tom turned the music off .
I &apos;ll sleep in my room .
Do you have one ?
I &apos;m not going out because I have to do my homework .
He was busy yesterday afternoon .
I want my children to learn to speak French .
Tom did it all .
Please don &apos;t go .
You need us .
Are you all alone ?
I had completely forgotten .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
May I sit next to you ?
I hope you &apos;re not planning on wearing that dress to the party .
Tom often helps Mary .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
He doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
How many cats do you have ?
Everybody loves music .
I &apos;m going to go to the movies .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
This book is Tom &apos;s .
Give me my glasses .
I was up all night writing this report .
He came out of the room .
Tom will be along soon .
Please just tell me what &apos;s going on .
There isn &apos;t any need to speak so loud .
Can you open the window ?
I can &apos;t believe that you enjoyed that movie .
Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you .
We still need to buy some bread .
Is dinner ready ?
I slept on the boat .
Let me see what &apos;s in your hand .
Tom and Mary have been married three years .
I will try .
Allow me to buy that for you .
I was not sure what to do .
Time is money .
We &apos;re here to see Tom .
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
I believe in always telling the truth .
How long can you stay ?
It &apos;s still mine .
I didn &apos;t do anything .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to go to the park with us .
We had nothing to talk about .
It isn &apos;t true .
Tom is a tall man .
You are old enough to know this .
I &apos;m not a teacher .
He was silly enough to believe her .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here .
I just found them .
Has it arrived ?
Those are too big .
This coat looks loose on me .
My uncle has a large family .
I wish that I were young again .
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
That &apos;s no good , Tom .
He &apos;s completely crazy .
Everyone &apos;s asleep .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything to do with Mary .
We &apos;re reliable .
Many people shop here .
What &apos;s Tom found ?
Tom is in heaven now .
I think you should pick Tom .
I worked all night .
Tom wasn &apos;t drunk .
You &apos;ll love Tom .
We live in Boston .
I don &apos;t remember where I bought it .
He works all night .
I thought Tom wanted to marry Mary .
What &apos;s up with you ?
Who gave you this ?
I was sick .
Why would you want to be a teacher ?
She loves Tom more than she loves me .
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary .
Tom is going to Boston with me .
I wrote the song for her .
Tom and I &apos;ll do that .
He called at my house .
I only have one brother .
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
I want a girlfriend .
I may have told you this story before .
Tom said that isn &apos;t the only reason .
I want to hear more about Tom .
We didn &apos;t even get that far .
Here &apos;s your money .
We instantly became friends .
There &apos;s a telephone here .
Tom drove to Mary &apos;s home .
Let me drive you home .
This hat is too big for you .
That problem is too simple .
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
Tom told me that his father had passed away .
I remember seeing her .
There &apos;s no room for us to sit down .
We take that very seriously .
Tom paid me .
I want to play the guitar .
Tom didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that this morning .
We just don &apos;t know why .
All of them went there .
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know he was rich .
You can stay here as long as you like .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d want from you .
I don &apos;t want you to be late .
I could have lost my job .
Tom didn &apos;t mind .
I &apos;m not going to go there again .
Tom asked Mary to give him some money .
I don &apos;t know whether you like her or not .
What have you given me ?
If you wish , you can go .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s parents .
I lost sight of Tom .
You don &apos;t have to help .
I just don &apos;t feel like it .
Tom needed someone to help him .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
Why are you back from lunch so soon ?
It &apos;s close to my house .
I don &apos;t agree with you .
Tom wanted to have dinner in bed .
I &apos;ve got to go now .
Stop that !
Tom tried opening the door .
Why didn &apos;t you help Tom ?
He is taller than his father .
They don &apos;t know yet .
Tom wasn &apos;t sick .
You don &apos;t even know his name , do you ?
I &apos;m still thinking about it .
Has he come yet ?
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Have you been busy recently ?
I wish I could live in Boston .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
Where &apos;s the nearest station ?
Tom is falling .
No one believes that anymore .
I pretended to be listening .
Tom came here to help me .
Who can solve the problem ?
Tom is good at what he does .
She waited for hours and hours .
Tom needs your help .
Can you show us the house ?
When are you coming back home ?
Come on !
No one helped me when I was in trouble .
I remember Tom .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
I helped her with her work .
Tom is going to love Australia .
He stopped talking .
I think Tom is in love .
I just told Tom the truth .
What will they do ?
How did you get into the house ?
Tom spoke loud enough for everyone to hear .
They &apos;re too dangerous .
Now listen carefully .
We are changing our clothes .
You know that I don &apos;t like eggs .
I can &apos;t come today or tomorrow either .
She likes wine .
This is incorrect .
I wanted more .
Tom didn &apos;t even know where he was .
Tom believes him .
Tom is a little older than me .
This is my desk .
I found them .
Tom said he thought I was dead .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
I hate to eat alone .
We shouldn &apos;t have done this .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
I should &apos;ve told you everything earlier .
Did you do that ?
My hair &apos;s too long .
You can go wherever you want to go .
I &apos;m your boss .
Tom asked Mary why she was buying so much food .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave his dog with me .
Tom lives nearby .
If it were not for your help , I could not succeed .
Stop that right now .
Tom won &apos;t be able to go with us .
Can you help me , please ?
Tom helps anybody that asks him .
We &apos;d love to work with you .
Tom was wearing a new hat .
Go there with me .
She will never talk about it .
War isn &apos;t good .
Tom , will you stop that ?
I do it because I enjoy it .
Do you want to drink tea or coffee ?
I was your mother &apos;s first boyfriend .
Please go to school .
It is going to rain soon .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary at all .
I &apos;m not good with kids .
What is it you &apos;d like me to do ?
The man stood up and began to sing .
I wanted to help , but there was nothing I could do .
Tom left the house .
He looked like a doctor .
Please buy a few apples .
I don &apos;t mind if the weather is hot .
You might &apos;ve misunderstood me .
How old is your cat ?
Nobody could &apos;ve expected this .
You have to start .
Tom wants someone to love him .
Perhaps Tom would enjoy doing that .
Why weren &apos;t you able to do that ?
Eat whatever you like .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
You do look a little better today .
It doesn &apos;t bother me to walk in the rain .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave now .
It is probable that she will come .
This tree is bigger than all the others .
&quot; I want that book , &quot; he said to himself .
He &apos;s very ill .
Is this baby a boy or a girl ?
What did you do yesterday ?
Tom is probably still terrified .
Let &apos;s get some lunch .
I got here as fast as I could .
Did you see his face ?
My bike was stolen last week .
Do you want another one of these ?
Why don &apos;t you say something ?
I want to drive .
I &apos;m thinking about you .
Tom is big .
It &apos;s time we went home .
I hope you will be pleased with this present .
I couldn &apos;t wait .
Are you happy ?
I have no idea where we are .
What will you do ?
I thought as much .
Tom only spent three dollars for his lunch .
I &apos;ll phone you .
That is my overcoat .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
Since I was tired , I went to bed .
I come here every Monday .
I asked Mary to dance with me .
Are you a good cook ?
How old is he now ?
Tom , can I have a moment with you alone ?
If you really want to speak to me , it &apos;s now or never .
Tom is always telling Mary that he loves her .
Tom is worried .
He is still standing .
You can help .
Why did they just leave ?
Tom probably has a girlfriend already .
I knew I should &apos;ve married you .
Tom stayed over .
That &apos;s good advice .
What a tall boy he is !
This has never happened before .
Is anybody hurt ?
I was off duty .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
I &apos;m on my way to visit a friend in the hospital .
I wonder where your brother has gone to .
So far , so good .
We don &apos;t have enough beer .
I like cats .
Please give me some more coffee .
Be proud of yourself .
How sick is Tom ?
I &apos;ll see you when I get there .
Tom was home .
Make sure Tom doesn &apos;t see you .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have let Mary drive .
Children begin school when they are six years old .
We &apos;ll see .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
Do you want to hang out at my place ?
Tom needs to go to the hospital .
I &apos;ve known Tom longer than I &apos;ve known you .
I &apos;m not going to use it .
She plays tennis very well .
Most of them were university students .
It will stop raining soon .
Are you sure that you want to go there ?
We learn English at school .
Take your time .
Tom got hurt .
I guess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
Tom didn &apos;t want us at his party .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t have as many friends as Mary does .
Tom said he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
When &apos;s Tom coming ?
I want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
We &apos;re supposed to be together .
Tom told Mary his phone number .
Both of you are right .
Who invited you guys ?
Have you finished your homework ?
I heard that Tom did that .
I won &apos;t hurt you .
Tom left yesterday right after you did .
I told him to come .
Do you think I like this ?
I &apos;ve got much work to do at the moment .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
Tom bought a new car .
That &apos;s too much .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like me .
I want to talk to you about Tom .
Can you please leave me alone ?
She is said to have been beautiful .
We &apos;re sorry , too .
A lot can happen in a year .
Tom seems to know exactly what he &apos;s doing .
Did you find your keys ?
This should be interesting .
It &apos;s been over a year since the accident .
I &apos;m going to the police .
I wish I were by your side .
Tom can no longer live here .
Do you know this ?
I want to go to another country .
Tom won &apos;t be here until 2 : 30 .
I know what I want .
I don &apos;t feel so good .
When did you arrive ?
I &apos;m talking about you .
I can hardly understand you .
Tom is with her .
We need to take Tom home .
You will never know where he is .
She began to sing .
I think I know him .
He did what they told him .
Is it really true ?
The choice is yours .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom asked Mary to stay .
I can read your thoughts .
He has come a long way .
We are young .
What am I doing here ?
Where &apos;s Tom gone ?
Tom wondered whether he should let Mary go to Australia with John .
Nobody ever told me that before .
That will put you in danger .
Thanks . You &apos;ve been a big help .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
Tom didn &apos;t know how to reach Mary .
No one has said a word .
I think we &apos;d better wait a little longer .
How could I help you ?
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
We just need a little more money .
I bought it with my own money .
This is where we live .
They may be in danger .
I like both .
She isn &apos;t my sister , she &apos;s my wife .
Someone made a mistake .
I &apos;m sure it would be a mistake to tell Tom .
Let them know we &apos;re busy .
This &apos;ll help .
How often do you come to Boston ?
Did you really do that ?
His house is easy to find .
We &apos;ve got to take care of it .
You &apos;d better start now .
Can money buy happiness ?
I don &apos;t know what happened to you .
Tom is one of the three men that came here yesterday .
Tom wrote to a friend .
I hate this town .
You are to come with me .
Anything that can be misunderstood will be .
I &apos;m likely to be here all afternoon .
If I knew anything , I &apos;d tell you .
I thought Tom would meet Mary .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good decision .
Tom knows what this is .
He loves her . She loves him , too .
I have my things .
There &apos;s a lot to do .
We ate together .
My uncle works in this office .
The garden is in front of the house .
Tom is very hungry .
I speak French every day at work .
I &apos;m not finished .
He &apos;ll be here again .
Thanks .
Why &apos;s Tom going to Boston ?
She had no idea what I said .
Tom can &apos;t mean that .
That was bad .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
I think Tom is correct .
We were studying all afternoon .
I &apos;ve got something .
I can &apos;t see him either .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
What do you think I should &apos;ve said ?
She doesn &apos;t have any children , does she ?
I have something I have to tell Tom .
Have you seen my sister ?
Please go .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
Thank you for helping Tom .
Tom believes everything Mary says .
Do it quickly .
Tom knows why nobody came to his party .
They &apos;re going to do it for us .
I &apos;m probably wrong .
I did that because I wanted to .
If it were not for her help , I would not succeed .
I don &apos;t remember any of this .
Tom will drive you home .
Open the window .
Tom is absent .
Here is your bag .
I like it when it &apos;s hot .
Let &apos;s start here .
Is Tom interested ?
We &apos;ve already met .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
When you can &apos;t do what you want , you do what you can .
We &apos;ve arrived a little late .
These clothes are too small for him .
I &apos;ve never lived in Boston .
Is there someone who could help me ?
Today my son turns four years old .
Tom is getting married soon .
I don &apos;t even think about it anymore .
I saw you working in the garden .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
Tom started dancing to the music .
Do you want to know why I &apos;m here ?
That &apos;s my cat .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
My parents are both dead .
It &apos;s six o &apos;clock already .
We can try .
My cat is hungry .
Does Tom have a problem with that ?
I can hardly walk .
I have some things I need to tell you .
Tom nervously opened the door .
I have a question for you .
It seems like we have to go now .
Are you still up ?
Tom was afraid to swim .
I am not coming today .
It doesn &apos;t matter to Tom .
The dinner is almost ready .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston , and I don &apos;t intend to ever go there .
Tom should be given a chance .
I don &apos;t remember what time Tom told me to meet him tomorrow .
I wonder whether Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday .
How long do I have ?
I didn &apos;t mean to yell .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
I have a headache .
I &apos;ll let everybody know .
Tell me what happened .
How are you going to spend your weekend ?
I can &apos;t talk right now . I need to go .
We &apos;ve got something for you .
I hope you don &apos;t mind walking .
Let &apos;s take a taxi .
I like Tom better .
What do you want to give Tom ?
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
I believe in always telling the truth .
Tom is going to love that .
No one saw you , I hope .
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
What is it that you need ?
How about tomorrow ?
I saw my uncle on the way to school .
If it had not been for his help , I would have failed .
I think we can get everything we need .
I &apos;d like to know more about Boston .
I think you &apos;d better go and visit him .
Tom is crazy about Mary .
She is proud of her son .
Nothing happened .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
They &apos;re both dead .
Tom helps anyone that asks him .
This doesn &apos;t sound right .
I &apos;ll be home as soon as I can .
I would rather stay at home than go to the movies tonight .
They believe it .
I &apos;ve run out of milk .
Come out and play .
Everyone waited .
Tom has friends all over the world .
Do you have any plans for the weekend ?
Life is short .
This building is near completion .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
What &apos;s Tom going to do ?
I &apos;d like to visit Boston .
How does Tom feel about it ?
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
I like my new job .
I &apos;m fine .
Everybody likes Tom .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
You &apos;d better go home .
It won &apos;t amount to anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
What do you mean by that ?
She has never visited him .
Are you proud of your father ?
Tom wanted to learn .
I believe Tom is right .
Why did you leave ?
I want to learn how to speak French .
Tom is only five , but he already knows how to read .
Tom may do that again .
They are not tired .
I have a couple of questions I &apos;d like to ask .
I was out all day .
Do you know where my key is ?
Tom looks older .
How is the weather there ?
I don &apos;t care what others think about me .
The house has been bought .
Tom is writing a book .
She went to that store .
I want to be rich .
What I need is a beer .
I read the whole book in one day .
I think we need to have a talk .
Why don &apos;t you take a taxi ?
Tom is my boss .
I just don &apos;t feel like going to school today .
You missed your chance .
I want kids .
Tom knew that Mary was in danger .
I have a thesis to write .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
It was almost too easy .
We need your help .
I like being in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French at all .
Are you sure that you know me ?
Tom was unable to walk .
Do whatever you like .
Tom is himself again .
I wonder what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
My wife thinks I &apos;m crazy .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
I don &apos;t like the name Tom .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel tired .
Do you really want to be here ?
I had enough money to buy that dress .
I understand your language .
How long has Tom been working here ?
What do you enjoy doing ?
He &apos;s not worthy of you .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will do that .
Why can &apos;t he play tennis today ?
Tom lost his job .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s office ?
I need to go back to Boston .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
This is the town where he was born .
I might be able to help you .
He runs very fast .
The baby is sleeping .
I love being alone .
Why does that interest you ?
How does Tom know about that ?
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking .
You played tennis yesterday .
He &apos;s already left .
Tom stayed .
Tom can &apos;t swim and neither can Mary .
You &apos;re like Tom .
I like doing this .
I don &apos;t have time now .
I don &apos;t speak English .
I &apos;m on the way home .
It &apos;s to the point .
We can &apos;t leave Boston until we finish this job .
He is sure that he will succeed .
I really don &apos;t want anything to eat right now .
What &apos;ll you drink , Tom ?
Tom and Mary had a lot of fun .
I have never been to Boston .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here ?
Tom is a lot better at it than I am .
You can &apos;t always make everyone happy .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
Tom says he hasn &apos;t eaten in three days .
Are you free this weekend ?
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore .
I am disappointed .
You have to go .
I don &apos;t care what others think about me .
Aren &apos;t you going to bed ?
How many books does he have ?
That is quite another matter .
You &apos;ll be very happy here .
I think Tom needs a vacation .
That street is very noisy .
It &apos;s a promise .
We are going to meet him tonight .
Tom asked me if I were hungry .
The train leaves at six .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether what Mary says is true or not .
Tom and Mary love each other .
Tom won &apos;t live long .
Tom used to do that .
That must never happen .
The reason doesn &apos;t matter .
We expect that to happen .
Tom sat down underneath a tree .
Tom goes to school by bus .
I know you can make it .
Tom went to Boston by himself .
I &apos;m at school .
They said it &apos;s OK .
Tom took the money .
Tom wants you to do it for him .
Let me give you a piece of advice .
I don &apos;t know what I did wrong .
Did you figure it out on your own ?
Do you have one a little bigger than these ?
I &apos;d do it if I could .
We &apos;ll be there at half past two .
I think I &apos;d like that .
I expect that he will help us .
He will always be with you .
Tom called the police .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
I don &apos;t have it with me .
It &apos;s your problem , not mine .
Tom has fallen in love with Mary .
What did she buy at that store ?
I want you here tomorrow by 2 : 30 .
He went there to learn English .
Do you know who they are ?
Would you like meat or fish ?
I think it &apos;s happening again .
Make love , not war .
I fail to see what &apos;s so amusing .
Don &apos;t you want to hear my side of the story ?
He came by bus .
It took him ten minutes to solve the problem .
What makes you ask that ?
Tom went abroad .
We can help Tom .
Tom takes the kids to the school every day .
That &apos;s for you .
My French isn &apos;t very good .
Tom was behind me .
Don &apos;t let anybody see you .
Did you speak French yesterday ?
Can you hear it ?
Tom deserves this .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom .
You &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
We were reading a book and it was a very good one .
What did you think when you actually met me for the first time ?
I wonder if he is married .
I wish I could buy that guitar .
Tom usually helps me do my homework .
That &apos;s what she said .
When will we arrive ?
He can &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t let you use that .
What did Tom get me ?
Where are you ?
I &apos;m a little early .
I wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
I wasn &apos;t a bit tired .
I &apos;m not your father .
Tom has been looking for you .
I can cook .
Tom may use my bicycle whenever he wants .
Listen to what I am saying .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was asleep .
Tom came here last week .
Tom can &apos;t walk any more .
Please give me something to eat .
Tom has been in Boston since last Monday .
I suspect he is ill .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s dog &apos;s name .
How long have you guys been standing there ?
Tom went home by taxi .
This is our car .
Do you have enough time ?
I could have died tonight .
What can you tell me about Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
How did you come by such a large sum of money ?
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom in private .
We can &apos;t do this without you .
Tom can &apos;t see you .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston .
Go to work .
Thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
Tom arrived home safely .
How did you accomplish this ?
Why are you mad at Tom ?
Tom will spend tomorrow here .
We have finished the work for today .
I &apos;d like you to see it .
We can &apos;t trust what she says .
I &apos;m not even sure if that would help or not .
I have to go with Tom .
It wasn &apos;t me . It was the cat .
I can speak a little English .
We could sing together .
Tom used to date Mary .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom was surprised .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to talk to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary either .
It &apos;s true .
Are we sure about this ?
This is his car .
The weather had been hot .
Help yourself to a piece of cake .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
They won &apos;t find Tom there .
I didn &apos;t know that dogs swim well .
Tom is in his car waiting for Mary .
The clock is wrong .
Will you let me try once more ?
I slept like a baby .
I was just about to say that .
What is it you like about Tom ?
I met them .
Tom always tells the truth .
You &apos;re totally right .
I thought Tom lived in Boston .
They have to repair their car .
What do I need ?
We &apos;re a little busy right now .
She knows what you did .
Tom is a very good student .
I &apos;m not good at tennis .
Tom was there for three hours .
Tom said he &apos;d never been to Boston .
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
Would you like to sit ?
Can you open this for me ?
That &apos;s what I hope .
Have you called the boss already ?
I wish that had never happened .
He was stupid enough to believe what she said .
We have our lives to live .
It was not so simple to write a letter in English .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
We enjoy watching TV .
What have I done wrong ?
Tom was correct about one thing .
I &apos;d love to be your age .
Did you go to see a doctor ?
You &apos;re quite drunk .
Let &apos;s just try to have a good time .
I really like you a lot .
I believe you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary and John don &apos;t like each other .
I &apos;ve already done that once today .
We don &apos;t need your money .
May I help you ?
What &apos;re you after ?
Tom is going to love doing that .
Do you know where we are ?
How are you ?
I still can &apos;t dance .
You should not speak so loud .
Tom told me he was glad to see me .
Tom thinks it &apos;ll be OK .
I &apos;m glad you came today .
We should really try harder .
I haven &apos;t gotten around to doing that yet .
That car is very new .
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
May I help you ?
Do you have any children ?
I left home at seven .
I can &apos;t do that .
Tom &apos;s French isn &apos;t very good .
Could you tell me the way to the station , please ?
Tom was disappointed at not being invited .
Your brother will not buy it .
Is it really possible ?
Tom is the kind of person who always has to have the last word .
He will be ready .
Let &apos;s not forget that Tom doesn &apos;t understand French .
I bought a watch and I lost it the next day .
There &apos;s no point talking to you , because you won &apos;t do as I say anyway .
Tom is still waiting for an answer .
I don &apos;t really like dogs all that much .
Tom hardly ever makes a mistake .
I knew you &apos;d be hungry .
He will be free tomorrow .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
I don &apos;t need a girlfriend .
I have to speak to Tom immediately .
When did you go to work ?
I like your car .
I came here for a vacation .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
Tom has been doing that for a number of years .
I think Tom is too young to be dating .
I don &apos;t know what has happened to him .
I haven &apos;t found it yet .
Tom considered the question .
You didn &apos;t invite me .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
If I knew him better , I would tell him the truth .
Tom managed to find a new job .
Being with him always makes me happy .
I &apos;m sorry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .
I &apos;m not taking Tom &apos;s word for it .
The taxi has arrived .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
Tom is much taller than you .
Tom won &apos;t admit that he &apos;s done anything wrong .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do it without you .
Do you want to come over to my house ?
He has a good position in the bank .
Tom always blames me for everything .
I don &apos;t often come to Boston .
I come from Boston .
How was I dressed then ? Do you remember ?
Mary is a good mother .
Please give me something to eat .
You know where I &apos;ll be .
Tom asked me to help him .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
I don &apos;t know how to stop it .
What are we having for supper ?
I don &apos;t like what you &apos;re saying .
You look pretty drunk .
He bought me a new dictionary .
I must buy one .
I &apos;ll be here until next week .
Both Tom and Mary are very frightened .
I know what &apos;s in the box .
I &apos;m quite hungry .
These apples are very big .
I want to learn .
I &apos;ve been busy since yesterday .
Tom isn &apos;t a doctor .
We have no time to waste .
He loves us .
I need more time .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know why Mary is scared of him .
That should please everyone .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
Tom said he has to go .
Tom asked Mary why she was so late .
I &apos;m not going to lose .
I was just about to leave .
I didn &apos;t think you were going to make it .
Where do you know him from ?
My father has a lot of books .
It &apos;s not too late to do that .
We have finished lunch .
I have a right to know .
Fire !
Why are you guys so angry ?
If I can do it , so can you .
I like English best .
I know Tom is old .
Tom just watches .
You &apos;re too young to die .
Can I have your telephone number ?
I have no idea who Tom is .
I started working for this company last year .
I won &apos;t forget that .
&quot; Where &apos;s his book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
All the other kids do it .
I want to wait for Tom .
I &apos;m able to speak .
My bag is very heavy .
We have to tell Tom .
Why should I be scared ?
Tom did everything for Mary .
I &apos;m just watching TV .
Tom got on the bus .
I want more of that .
We can &apos;t afford to make mistakes .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see me like that .
I &apos;m going to read some other books .
Have you written a book ?
We must find it .
Tom is staying .
Where are you going ?
Are any meals included ?
I think it &apos;ll rain today .
We paid for it .
Without you , my life would be meaningless .
Do you know what &apos;s become of Tom ?
Is there anyone in the room ?
Tom got what he wanted .
I gave Tom a chance .
We really don &apos;t have time .
Why are people scared of you ?
Tom isn &apos;t married .
I &apos;ll call you every night .
How do you like your new car ?
This book will do .
That &apos;s the building where my dad works .
Playing with fire is dangerous .
Do you have a best friend ?
Tom and Mary are here .
Tom and Mary now live in Boston .
I go to school at seven o &apos;clock .
She doesn &apos;t do anything else .
We &apos;re waiting for Tom .
I may be too old .
We &apos;ve known each other for three years .
Here &apos;s my telephone number .
Did Tom tell the truth ?
I invited Tom to the party .
How much food do you need ?
I thought that you might &apos;ve left town .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
I &apos;m studying English at home .
Tom knows Mary knows .
He missed the last train .
Tom isn &apos;t crazy .
She needs someone to talk to .
I like dogs , but my sister likes cats .
I can &apos;t stay for long .
What do I need to do ?
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
Tom says he can change that .
You can change it if you like .
There &apos;s something about Tom that I don &apos;t like .
We have to do it together .
Tom has three kids .
I like Tom &apos;s voice .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
There are scarcely any flowers in our garden .
Tom is a good friend of yours , isn &apos;t he ?
Are you saying you don &apos;t know ?
Tom didn &apos;t remember where he &apos;d put his passport .
When are you going to get here ?
You don &apos;t have to say that .
&quot; Who helped you ? &quot; &quot; Tom did . &quot;
Mary likes to wear flowers in her hair .
They won &apos;t know .
Are you always busy ?
He looks exactly like his brother .
Tom and Mary probably don &apos;t know each other .
What &apos;s the point ?
You disappointed me .
I feel like I know you .
You have what they want .
She goes to school on foot .
How would you like your coffee ?
You don &apos;t have a clue .
Where can I have my watch repaired ?
Everyone should like that .
I don &apos;t know what that thing is .
Tom had nothing to drink .
I &apos;m not giving up on you .
What if I &apos;m right ?
I thought that he was angry .
He no longer works here .
He won &apos;t be away for long .
How long have you had this problem ?
I &apos;ll tell you how to do it .
Is it anything like mine ?
That &apos;s pretty serious .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here with us ?
That &apos;s Tom .
Tom said you &apos;d come .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
I &apos;m afraid this key does not fit .
He drives a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
We &apos;re all proud of you .
I wonder what I need to do .
I want to get married , just not to you .
Tom is coming home .
How did you get to know her ?
I liked it a lot .
Tom died , not Mary .
Tom told Mary she was beautiful .
Tom wanted to know why Mary wasn &apos;t here .
It doesn &apos;t hurt so much .
Could you do that , Tom ?
Yesterday I went to the movies .
I have a plan . Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
When did you marry your wife ?
I think Tom looks really good .
I wonder why Tom is doing that .
I &apos;ve never been late before .
What do you want to ask me ?
My house is big .
Don &apos;t you want me to do anything ?
I was able to answer the question correctly .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m used to .
He is the only child they have .
They know we &apos;re out here .
Why are you angry with Tom ?
I &apos;ll show you around town .
Have you eaten lunch ?
Tom was with me all day .
No one knew a thing .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
How did you find us ?
Tom wants to be finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
Where &apos;s my suitcase ?
Tom helps anybody who asks him .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
Tom knew where to go .
I got mad .
You look very beautiful today .
Nobody talked about the movie .
What &apos;s the name of the man who was talking to you ?
She telephoned just now .
I know that already .
Tom isn &apos;t much taller than his father .
I wonder who she is .
I &apos;m sore all over .
Tom spent many years in prison .
Tom has three uncles .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know .
She is quiet .
How often do you go swimming ?
Tom couldn &apos;t forget Mary even if he wanted to .
The idea is not bad .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about Mary &apos;s family .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
Please tell them where they need to go .
I think Tom wants more .
Tom looked at Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
They &apos;ll never know we &apos;re here .
Tom came to help .
I will show you around the city .
What do you want to do in Boston ?
Tom , where are we ?
I knew that already .
Tom took Mary home .
I never leave home without it .
I have to call my father .
I &apos;ll ask him if he will come .
Are you through with this book ?
I don &apos;t know how , but you did it .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
This doesn &apos;t involve you .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Tom needs it .
Do you really want to learn another language ?
What do you usually do on weekends ?
He &apos;s not a good person .
I had dinner with Tom .
Yours was better .
Tom came across the street .
It doesn &apos;t hurt at all .
You make me happy .
I hope Tom agrees .
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
I &apos;m not as stupid as you think I am .
Tom insists he &apos;s telling the truth .
I &apos;ll never see her again .
Is there a train station near here ?
We &apos;ll do it the same way we did it last time .
Tom is only happy when he &apos;s with Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you everything .
Tom knows the family .
I know French .
Tom just bought a car , too .
You look different today .
You cannot be too careful in choosing friends .
What Tom wants to do isn &apos;t going to help .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s mother ?
There is an apple on the table .
That &apos;s no way to talk to your teacher .
Where do you want to eat ?
Don &apos;t you believe me ?
He took his book .
I &apos;m not angry !
I &apos;m happy to be able to help you .
His life is full of trouble .
What a beautiful town !
I was starting to think you &apos;d forgotten .
I &apos;ll let you know later .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for days .
Are these all your books , Tom ?
What did Tom steal ?
I hope that Tom does that .
Tom belongs in jail .
Is he your teacher ?
I need this more than you do .
It &apos;s no use waiting for him to come .
It &apos;ll be over in a moment .
It &apos;s hardly raining at all .
I got tired of waiting for Tom .
My pet cat died yesterday .
My mother lives by herself .
Tom came to my office today .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
Tom is still there , waiting for you .
I like her very much .
I won &apos;t do that again .
I was in Australia last week .
It &apos;s all I want .
It &apos;s not your money that I want .
I hate this place .
How was the weather yesterday ?
Tom seldom gets sick .
You are my friend .
Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
Who is she ?
We have to have this .
Where is it ?
She always speaks ill of others .
How long were you gone ?
You are as tall as my sister .
Tom ran out of food .
Tom is there .
Those two really hit it off .
Where did this happen ?
Tom said something to Mary .
It &apos;s too soon .
I &apos;ll go to Tom .
There are almost no books .
Tom didn &apos;t want to ask for help .
I already told Tom everything .
I &apos;m busy , so I can &apos;t go .
Why don &apos;t you go see Tom ?
I &apos;ll find someone .
Tom wrote to Mary this week .
We want a woman who &apos;s good at cooking .
He &apos;s asleep .
I &apos;m a good person .
You look just like your big brother .
I intended to go , but forgot to .
I don &apos;t have a phone .
Tom stayed in Boston a few days .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Tom says he likes studying French .
You &apos;re not looking .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I only know what I &apos;ve been told .
Will you have another cup of tea ?
How was the weather yesterday ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak good French .
Tom used to work in Boston .
How bad do you want it ?
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
I was in the house .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
He went abroad .
Tom never told me that you were so beautiful .
I don &apos;t recall saying that .
Tom left Australia three years ago .
Please listen carefully to what I have to say .
Do you know what they said ?
The parents are playing a game with their children .
Tom looks bummed .
You can dance , can &apos;t you ?
Do Tom and Mary know ?
What are you doing , Tom ?
That remains to be seen .
I &apos;ll be back within two hours .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the movie .
I just have one question for you .
I cannot afford the time for a vacation .
Tom wants to study in Australia .
What are you watching ?
Thank you for today .
What Tom has told you is true .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mom .
Why do you like Boston ?
Tom never listens to me .
He stayed in the hotel .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand this .
Could you help me find my dog ?
How did it all come about ?
If Tom really liked me , he wouldn &apos;t have done that .
This dog is Tom &apos;s .
Tom seems to have been rich .
You can &apos;t buy anything if you have no money .
I &apos;m almost done with the report .
It &apos;s too late now .
They looked very happy .
Tom ate it .
Tom is going to be back here soon .
Why did you start learning French ?
There &apos;s a lot at stake .
Tom walked in the room .
It looks like snow .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of water .
What time are you planning to leave ?
&quot; Where were you ? &quot; &quot; I was at a friend &apos;s house . &quot;
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon .
It is very cold today , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s difficult .
You aren &apos;t allowed to do that .
I didn &apos;t study at all .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I &apos;ve just lost the best friend I ever had .
Tom is still in Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
You &apos;re as beautiful as ever .
I &apos;ve got a lot of things to do this week .
I told you Tom was busy .
Tom got very mad .
He is always with me .
I know that you don &apos;t like me .
Tom and I had a lot of fun together .
Is Tom your brother ?
You don &apos;t really know , do you ?
I &apos;m only thinking of you .
I feel bad .
I &apos;m just happy to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a sense of humor .
I really want to be a good teacher .
It just doesn &apos;t seem possible .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
Perhaps you &apos;d better drive .
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home .
How did you do it without our help ?
Why am I not surprised ?
You look hot .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party yesterday .
I saw somebody .
Don &apos;t be late for work .
He seems to be ill .
Tom saw Mary in her car .
Tom asked for our help .
Your food &apos;s getting cold .
Don &apos;t you have anything else ?
Anybody knows it .
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We &apos;re taking off .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to the movies as often as he &apos;d like to .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that .
Perhaps Tom left .
Are you through with the newspaper ?
It is raining all the time .
Do you know it ?
It &apos;s my fault this has happened .
Tom showed Mary his garden .
I love what I do .
Tom has something else on his mind .
This book belongs to you .
Why did you leave ?
Tom , I need to tell you something .
I thought Tom was in Australia .
I have a couple questions .
I like what I like .
What are you reading now ?
Tom is good at this .
They don &apos;t listen to me .
I &apos;m having lots of fun .
I would really like to learn more about your country .
That didn &apos;t help them any .
I gave him a few books .
Tom seemed scared .
The bicycle under the tree is mine .
I went to the park yesterday .
I thought it was a secret .
There is nothing to do .
I &apos;m not happy with this .
This is a hazard to your health .
I can do this all night .
Where are you from ?
My phone &apos;s stopped working .
Tom showed up at about 2 : 30 .
Tom &apos;ll die .
Tom would &apos;ve been able to do it .
War concerns us all .
I really enjoyed that .
Can you do this ?
The vacation is close to an end .
I &apos;ve just finished lunch .
I don &apos;t know where I am .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
Can I do anything for you ?
I know that he went to London .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t do that .
That is our father .
What are you going to do here ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
This book is yours .
Tom knows when to stop .
Tell Tom not to tell Mary .
They don &apos;t know my name .
No one had any questions about the plan .
Tom thinks I love Mary .
Take care of yourself .
This is my house .
How long are they ?
They &apos;re best friends .
I still believe in love .
I &apos;ll get her to come here .
Tom used to date my daughter .
The food was better in prison .
I remember how he used to be .
Tom can explain .
I &apos;ll deal with this problem as soon as I can .
Tom might be able to do that .
Tom is working on the new plan .
It &apos;s a family trait .
There are a lot of people who can &apos;t do that .
These shoes are too big for me .
I didn &apos;t see what was in the box .
Tom did his homework by himself .
Please don &apos;t go away .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand what we meant .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that kind of thing anymore .
We may not be able to afford it .
I definitely won &apos;t try to help Tom again .
Do you want to know who I am ?
Tom seemed to have lost his key .
I think Tom likes doing that .
We &apos;ll talk about that soon .
This is my home .
You &apos;re late again .
We want to take it .
He looks as if he had been ill .
I never meant to put you in any danger .
Tom had a problem with Mary .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
It &apos;s a matter of time .
I voted for Tom .
Did you guys see that ?
It &apos;ll rain in the afternoon .
Do you want me to make coffee ?
I didn &apos;t make it very far .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
Tom has two children .
Did you ever try ?
He often appears on TV .
Is Tom satisfied ?
Who knows that ?
It &apos;s been a long time since we last saw each other .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t angry .
My brother is older than me .
I &apos;m not used to losing .
We &apos;re here because we want to talk to Tom .
I had already heard that song once .
Have you ever tried to learn another language ?
What do you want to ask me ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
This first question is for you .
Tom &apos;s so old .
This is the last time .
Why are you planning on going home early today ?
It has been raining heavily for three hours .
Tom is always short of money .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
I would like a cup of coffee .
Tom may do whatever he wants .
It &apos;s not that interesting .
She is everything to him .
Tom looks pleased .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Give it back to me .
I don &apos;t want to live here .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
I &apos;m already busy .
I &apos;ve just eaten lunch .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
Not all girls are like that .
Where does your grandpa live ?
I saw Tom die .
All is well .
Never have I seen such a thing .
Tom said that he never said that .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
This apartment is bigger than any other one in the building .
Tom has already won .
Where do I come in ?
I will come to see you next Sunday .
You know who I am , don &apos;t you ?
If they find us , we &apos;re dead .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
I hear Tom does that .
This is all I have to say .
Tom took Mary back to her car .
Tom is not too pleased .
I don &apos;t want to die tomorrow .
The old man spoke to me in French .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
I want you to leave now .
Tom may do whatever he wants to .
I can &apos;t give Tom these .
I said stop it !
I &apos;d like to go home .
Where did you find these ?
I don &apos;t want you to do this .
Isn &apos;t that your dictionary ?
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom might be right .
I &apos;ll be right there .
Get word to Tom .
He is tall , but his brother is much taller .
How often does it rain in Boston ?
Is Tom still at school ?
He took a day off .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I &apos;m sorry for what I &apos;ve done .
What has Tom done wrong ?
How did you come to know her ?
Do you know what Tom said ?
Do you feel like eating ?
We don &apos;t have the money .
I &apos;ll get ready .
Tom probably likes Mary .
Today is my little sister &apos;s birthday .
Do you know anything ?
He &apos;s not my boyfriend . He &apos;s my brother .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
Tom &apos;s children are sick .
Tom talked .
Tom is afraid to tell the truth .
I already know your secret .
I &apos;d love to do it .
I never talked to Tom .
Do you want me to believe that ?
Do you have any beer ?
I was planning on going to the beach today , but then it started to rain .
It &apos;s not my decision .
He went ballistic .
He spoke very loudly .
What he says is true .
He &apos;s a good person .
Why did you pick Tom ?
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
I go where I want to go .
I can &apos;t imagine that .
Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
Tom reads almost no books at all .
Tom likes it .
It &apos;s difficult to please Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
That &apos;s not true at all .
I have one with me .
Tom accepted Mary &apos;s gift .
Tom is sleeping on the couch .
You are free to do as you please with your money .
I like Tom &apos;s voice .
I knew you &apos;d get here in time .
You won &apos;t get rid of me that easily .
Tom had to run .
I will tell him about it when he comes next time .
You learn quickly .
This is how Tom does it .
I &apos;ll sing .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
Did you see the accident ?
Tom was in the kitchen .
Do you know who you ’ re talking to ?
We &apos;ll watch you .
Why are you angry ?
My father got home late last night .
Why are you mad ?
Tom needs to do that every morning .
You will notify Tom , won &apos;t you ?
I have nothing to do with the affair .
Tom is drunk .
Let &apos;s begin .
I &apos;ll give you thirty dollars for that .
No one can help you .
What &apos;s taking Tom so long ?
My mother and father aren &apos;t home right now .
I cannot carry this suitcase by myself .
I can &apos;t do any more .
Tom wondered what Mary was going to do .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
I want to try .
There &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a TV at home .
Tom tried solving the problem .
I just heard from Tom .
The boy made his parents happy .
Tom isn &apos;t talking to me .
What do they want us to do ?
It &apos;s foolish for you to swim when it &apos;s this cold .
What &apos;re you up to today ?
Tom bought a new car .
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
Do you want another one of these ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary about John .
I &apos;ll give you a good price .
I &apos;ll cook you whatever you want .
Let Tom eat whatever he wants .
Tom would like to know what he did wrong .
I don &apos;t remember getting paid for the work .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home yesterday .
I do it because I enjoy it .
Tom asked Mary to read it for him .
Is your mother at home ?
Have you called her yet ?
He has a lot of difficulty seeing without his glasses .
Do you want to come along with us ?
I &apos;ll go to the park .
Are you busy ?
Tom pretended he didn &apos;t care .
I want to learn guitar .
Tom and Mary are planning to get married .
Tom is still waiting for you .
I saw a dog .
That &apos;s even better .
We did nothing wrong .
Tom does love Mary .
I can &apos;t discuss it .
You never know .
I think you &apos;ve been here too long .
I wanted to help you .
Tom acts like nothing else matters .
Tom and I have both been to Boston .
Tom lost all of his money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
I don &apos;t know if I can do that or not .
We finally did it .
When would you like me to come over ?
Can you come back later ?
I don &apos;t know how , but you did it .
Tom was never happy .
You made a good decision .
What &apos;s Tom wearing ?
What were they thinking ?
Tom looks ready .
I can &apos;t help feeling sorry for the girl .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got to go .
You don &apos;t have to go unless you want to .
Someone asked for you .
I have not finished breakfast yet .
The bus you want doesn &apos;t stop here .
Tom is seriously ill .
What is this fish called in English ?
That &apos;s my job .
Tom wanted to call Mary .
I had better ask them .
I didn &apos;t know you couldn &apos;t sing .
Watch closely .
It &apos;s up to you .
Here &apos;s your beer .
I want to know about you .
What are you up to this weekend ?
I didn &apos;t want Tom to think I was stupid .
Who else is there with you ?
I must find work .
I want a word with you .
May I introduce myself ?
It is supposed to rain today , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s not that simple .
Tom said he knew you .
I think I &apos;ll walk back .
I &apos;ll cook .
If you know the answer to this question , please tell me .
Tom received a letter from Mary .
I didn &apos;t buy the book .
When did you ask Tom ?
Tom hasn &apos;t even started studying for the exam yet .
If you want , you can easily make it .
Tom got mad .
I am going to my room , where I can study .
I don &apos;t like summer .
Help yourself to a piece of cake .
I have an idea .
I &apos;ve been told to help you .
We have a plan .
Tom will have to wait .
How can I get in touch with you ?
We can wait .
Do you know where Tom is taking us ?
Do you have bread for lunch ?
I hope to see you .
The baby appears hungry all the time .
I bought a dictionary .
He didn &apos;t show up at the party last night .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard that word in a long time .
Please look up this word in a dictionary .
You &apos;ve got to do it now .
Both his parents are dead .
I &apos;ve never seen you like this before .
I will buy a new car next month .
Since I was cold , I put on my coat .
She didn &apos;t visit anybody .
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
I forgot what I was about to say .
We can &apos;t go outside on a day like this without wearing coats .
Tom just wants to have fun .
I really liked the movie .
I cannot tell you everything that happened to me yesterday .
It &apos;s not funny .
I &apos;ll be right with you .
That &apos;s not your cup .
I know you &apos;re right .
She went with him .
He may be able to come tomorrow .
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was .
Is there anything you need to do today ?
I speak French much better than English .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
You have to see it to believe it .
I had little choice .
Give me two minutes .
Tom can &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
I let Tom leave .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary is here .
Your question is very hard to answer .
Tom and I don &apos;t talk much anymore .
He &apos;s really good looking .
Why aren &apos;t you here , Tom ?
Where are they living ?
Thank you for trying .
I like listening to good music .
I &apos;m very proud of my son .
No one should ever have to do that .
I can &apos;t recall who said that .
How late are you open ?
Our hotel is on the next street .
Add a little milk .
He wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
Take me home with you .
I &apos;m really not all that hungry .
The train doesn &apos;t stop at that station .
I heard that he bought a new computer .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been there .
Where &apos;s the newspaper ?
All of this is because of you .
How are you today ?
Tom was worried that he might be late .
I like summer the best .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary &apos;s father was .
He called me a cab .
Our baby isn &apos;t speaking yet .
We have to do something , Tom .
We don &apos;t have a problem .
I don &apos;t like being alone on the beach .
Are you still in love with Tom ?
Tom told me so himself .
I &apos;ll let someone else deal with it .
You have to make Tom believe you .
&quot; Thanks . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re welcome . &quot;
Do you want to study French ?
I can &apos;t remember the last time I took a vacation .
Tom says he &apos;s rich .
I tried hard .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I think I &apos;ll take Tom to Boston with me .
When did you meet her ?
I always thought Tom could swim .
Tom may do that however he likes .
I didn &apos;t even get an invitation .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
I can &apos;t see without my glasses .
She looked very beautiful in her new dress .
Let &apos;s leave when you are ready .
How much are you making ?
Tom has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
Life is what you make it .
You know I can &apos;t wait for you if you &apos;re late .
If I were in your place , I would lend him a hand .
Tom spoke French .
Tom never talks about his work .
You &apos;re very different from us .
I don &apos;t know how this works .
You need to get ready .
She showed him to his seat .
It seems that the news was false .
I have to be back home by seven .
Tom arrived just as I was going home .
Tom stayed in Boston for three days .
I often hear her play the piano .
Tom &apos;s a threat .
You must look after the child .
You don &apos;t have to come .
Tom likes cats .
He must love you .
I think there &apos;s something wrong here .
I can &apos;t think of everything .
I can &apos;t believe my ears .
She &apos;s in the hospital now .
Who has it now ?
Take us with you , Tom .
These are my shoes and those are yours .
Tom waited for more than an hour .
You can count on me .
How long have Tom and Mary known each other ?
Why do you say things like that ?
How are you going to do it ?
How do you know Tom has a dog ?
He wanted to meet you .
You &apos;re worried .
Do you want to try ?
Tom has many cats .
I &apos;ve got to try to find Tom .
I asked Tom to keep quiet .
He seems to have been sick last week .
You have the right to the truth .
I didn &apos;t understand what you said .
She knows my wife .
I don &apos;t feel safe here anymore .
The dog is in the house .
I &apos;m not a student .
Let Tom speak .
When was the last time you made your bed ?
I watch TV almost every evening .
You &apos;ve grown up .
I did not read a book yesterday .
When exactly did you get here ?
Tom seemed to know exactly what he was doing .
It &apos;s time we went home .
I do understand .
Tom said that Mary wouldn &apos;t be mad .
When does it arrive ?
What else did you see ?
Tom and Mary were also there .
I want to play , too .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
What &apos;s that look like to you ?
May I go to the river ?
Tom made Mary do that .
Have you finished it ?
I must have made a mistake somewhere .
Tom gets up at six every morning .
You don &apos;t have to go to school today .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
He can do it better than me .
Tom sat next to Mary at the piano .
Come along with us .
Where are your things ?
I heard you talking .
I have plenty of friends .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
