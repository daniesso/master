Don &apos;t play dead .
Tom often goes to Boston to visit his family .
They must have made a mistake .
We know something about it .
We &apos;re tired .
That &apos;ll be my next problem to solve .
Tom is very good at it .
If you have questions , ask away .
It serves you right .
I thought Tom was still in jail .
I assume you know who Tom is .
I think you &apos;ll want this .
He wants to talk to you .
Coming here was a mistake .
I need a new bicycle .
You don &apos;t think you can win , do you ?
Are you still here ?
Tom said he thought that he &apos;d be able to do that today .
I want to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
Are you ready to hear the bad news ?
I think I know that girl over there .
Tom looks just like me .
He did exactly as I had told him .
I want to write a book .
I thought you &apos;d want to know .
Tom is going to be thirty next year .
I didn &apos;t see anybody .
She came .
Tom is OK .
Tom is going to like those .
Tom left Australia a few days ago .
He &apos;s worried that he might be late .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gone swimming together in a long time .
Give me a glass of water , please .
I &apos;m careful .
I know nothing about him .
Tom told Mary he wasn &apos;t busy .
Teachers must understand children .
I know Tom helped you .
Tom still hasn &apos;t arrived .
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary is .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s true .
Anyone can see that .
I have more books than I can read .
I &apos;ll do what you say .
It was very cold , but I went out .
Why did you buy flowers ?
He knows hardly anything about it .
Tom is going to go to Australia .
Tom sat at his desk .
Let Tom carry it .
Your parents know where you are .
That is all .
She can play the piano well .
I &apos;ve all but finished doing that .
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
My brother is interested in English and music .
What did you do during the summer when you were a kid ?
Why me ?
You &apos;re lucky Tom helped you .
Do you know where she is ?
What will become of her ?
I thought you were a better guitar player than that .
Tom and I talked about this three weeks ago .
Nobody wants you to do this .
There is no clock in my room .
Don &apos;t ask me what that is .
Tom said he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom looks different today .
He was absent from school yesterday .
The question is who will do it .
How can I become rich ?
I &apos;ve told you all of this once already .
I don &apos;t really understand what you want to say .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word out of you .
Tell him to wait .
I could have been injured .
Did you see the accident with your own eyes ?
Don &apos;t ever come back here again .
Tom has given his word .
I thought you said you worked here .
Tom should have done it the way Mary told him to do it .
I &apos;m already ready .
Tom got on his bicycle and rode away .
She tried .
I think Tom wouldn &apos;t mind .
Tom &apos;s asleep .
Don &apos;t say it again .
When are you free ?
That &apos;s what we do here .
Tom is not happy with this .
I need to work .
You &apos;re the best brother in the whole world .
What time &apos;s your train ?
He shall have it .
You have to start .
Is that your son ?
I got scared just like everybody else .
I &apos;d do anything for Tom .
I have problems with my wife , too .
My book is here .
That &apos;s no reason to get angry .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is happy or not .
I don &apos;t have a dog .
You always were one of my best students .
Do you think that &apos;s true ?
I felt very happy .
You were never in any real danger .
We have nothing against it .
Tom made a mistake .
I don &apos;t care what Tom wears .
Everyone went to sleep .
I don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to swim .
I need to know before 2 : 30 .
I saw her somewhere two years ago .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
Give it to anyone you like .
Tom might have missed the train . He hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
Tom can &apos;t work tomorrow .
The problem is in that we don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t speaking to each other .
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
I would rather stay at home .
I asked you not to play with that .
Tom has three cats .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
We played together every day when we were kids .
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me .
Tom will probably be here all afternoon .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
Do you want kids ?
Do you have a picture ?
I wonder how long Tom has been here .
Are you up for that ?
Is your mother a good cook ?
I know why Tom is here .
My father died when I was three .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
She plays tennis after school .
I &apos;m not feeling very hungry right now .
I can &apos;t eat meat .
I found the building .
I really like them .
I believe you .
He did nothing but read newspapers .
Tom didn &apos;t believe it at first .
I knew you would understand .
This is my friend .
Tom got Mary drunk .
Don &apos;t you know what this is ?
How can I reach you ?
Tom quickly got dressed .
You know what I think .
Milk makes us strong .
I think we need to talk .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that .
Tom told everyone .
Tom and Mary look happy .
She is in the kitchen because she &apos;s making dinner .
If you don &apos;t do that , I won &apos;t either .
Tom isn &apos;t with us .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
How far are you prepared to go ?
You &apos;re spending less and less time with the children .
Tom was late for work .
Tom is important .
Why don &apos;t you come , too ?
Why do they come here ?
What was I supposed to say ?
I &apos;ve changed . I &apos;m not the same man I used to be .
You look just like my sister .
She looks very young .
He does not know .
What &apos;re Tom and Mary doing here ?
Tom is standing in front of Mary .
I only want to help Tom .
It &apos;s a good school .
He doesn &apos;t run .
Tom thinks Mary should apologize to John .
What do you have for me today ?
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
They love me .
Tom sat with Mary .
She looks exactly the same as she was at school .
Tom likes most of his teachers .
Tom wanted to turn himself in to the police .
She got a present from her boyfriend .
I &apos;m older than you think .
I want to buy a new car .
Where were you today ?
Thank you for coming , Tom .
Why is snow white ?
I learned that from you .
Tom ate an apple .
Tom wants to do that .
I must have my car fixed in a few days .
Why do you have to do it ?
I learned to live without her .
I can &apos;t get anyone to assist me .
I don &apos;t like those shoes .
I can &apos;t swim .
I have to get back to Boston .
Tom put the box on the table .
The girl caught a small fish .
She is not tall .
Tom was supposed to be here .
I met him three years ago .
I was born in Boston .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
What do you think of Japan ?
I &apos;d like to help you .
This is the last game .
Is it too far to walk ?
I think I remember you .
What have I missed ?
Tom isn &apos;t here yet .
Tom never really enjoyed doing that .
The bus stopped , but nobody got off .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter .
Don &apos;t tell Tom where you live .
He changed his mind .
Who was invited to the party ?
Tom isn &apos;t doing that the way he should be .
Anybody can do this .
I like to study languages .
Tom was wounded .
We don &apos;t have a lot of time .
I have lots of work to clear up by the weekend .
Could you explain it to me ?
I went to bed at one o &apos;clock .
Tom got into the car and slammed the door .
The question was too difficult to answer .
He speaks quickly .
I want your opinion .
Why would I tell you ?
I no longer want to live in Boston .
I heard you singing .
Is Tom sure ?
This is my job .
Tom bought his son a car .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be able to solve this problem by ourselves .
Tom seemed to be ill .
I &apos;m late .
What is the weather like today ?
Come outside .
It &apos;s cold today !
You were absent from school yesterday .
How would you like your coffee ?
I don &apos;t think I have much longer to live .
Everyone &apos;s happy again .
You leave me no choice .
I &apos;d like you to meet my son .
