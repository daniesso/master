I think I know what you need .
I met Tom for the first time three days ago .
When they &apos;re happy , we &apos;re happy .
I don &apos;t understand what she wants me to do .
I can &apos;t be something I &apos;m not .
&quot; What &apos;s your name ? &quot; I asked .
What are you doing here so early ?
Where can I find Tom ?
Tom stopped reading for a moment .
I hope you know that .
Tom gave Mary everything .
I can talk about anything with my best friend .
I can scarcely believe it .
Which cat is yours ?
Tom says he needs my help tomorrow .
I can &apos;t find a thing .
Tom married Mary last month .
Why doesn &apos;t he tell the truth ?
I never said I wasn &apos;t happy .
He is accustomed to the work .
Tom was sleepy .
I believed that he was a physician .
Tom doesn &apos;t particularly like Mary .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
Give Tom the money .
I remember seeing him once .
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
That &apos;s not a good idea .
Give it to me , please .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
It &apos;s far from here .
I would like to say something .
Should I wait for you here ?
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
Are you sure you want to do this ?
I just ate .
I almost forgot my passport .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
I don &apos;t know what you want and I don &apos;t care .
They live downstairs .
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand a thing .
It was really good .
What do you like about me ?
Thanks for dropping by .
Tom just arrived .
Do you know how long it &apos;ll take ?
We &apos;re not doing that .
We went to the movies .
What should Tom do ?
I love dogs .
I &apos;ve forgotten the name of Tom &apos;s wife .
It &apos;s early .
We need this report by tomorrow .
How do you think Tom does it ?
Tom stayed strong .
I don &apos;t know how , but you did it .
Tom had to leave his dog at home .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Where is your sister ?
I haven &apos;t been outside in weeks .
That would be dangerous .
She likes music very much .
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
Tom had a good reason .
When are you going to come ?
He has half as many books as I do .
What can I do for you this evening ?
He can play the piano better than I can .
I know that Tom is happy .
Have you ever been married ?
I &apos;ll give that to you .
She always lets her children do what they want to .
Tom is working on it now .
Tom speaks loudly .
It was a mistake on their part .
You guys love each other , right ?
Tom will be a good teacher .
I called Tom up from Boston .
They won &apos;t believe me .
Tom made me go .
This does not make me happy .
Tom called me almost every day .
Tom is there , isn &apos;t he ?
I got out of jail yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t remember .
I &apos;m not married .
Tom prefers speaking French .
Is this your beer ?
Tom had nothing to eat .
My brother likes music .
Why don &apos;t you go there ?
Tom said he was busy .
Tom is out of the office .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he heard .
No one will find out .
The students are back .
It &apos;s impossible to learn English in a month .
Tom said that somebody here needed help .
I know the truth .
I believe his name is Tom .
She &apos;s not here .
Don &apos;t tell anyone I was here .
It appears you &apos;re correct , Tom .
Who &apos;s that girl ?
I just don &apos;t feel safe here anymore .
Can I try it ?
She lives just across from us .
What &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
My mother can &apos;t attend .
I am eating .
It &apos;s fine today .
We &apos;re paid by the hour .
You can &apos;t scare me .
This is your big chance .
When I grow up , I want to be just like my father .
You &apos;ve gotten better .
I can &apos;t wait till summer .
Tom is going to like it here .
Why don &apos;t we take it with us ?
What books did you buy ?
We will purchase a new car next week .
This is Tom &apos;s .
Let &apos;s take a taxi .
I &apos;m afraid we have a problem .
Both Tom and I were scared .
We can &apos;t do this anymore .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
This problem is too difficult for me to explain .
Mary thinks I &apos;m in love with her .
Nobody was interested .
Tom looked very sleepy .
He looks very good .
Tom waited a good hour for Mary .
You have no idea , do you ?
What is in this box ?
I want to go swimming with a friend .
Sorry about yesterday .
Why is that good ?
He said that he would come back here tomorrow .
Tom told me everything .
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
Tom won &apos;t do that again .
Tom is my friend .
You should wait until Monday to do that .
Tom is incorrect .
Did you phone me ?
The baby doesn &apos;t walk yet .
Tom can play the piano much better than I can .
Can I talk to you for just a second ?
What are you doing ?
What &apos;ll you do ?
I &apos;m right .
I like Tom &apos;s plan better than Mary &apos;s plan .
I can &apos;t remember .
Tom came home very late .
I do want to see you .
I went to the doctor .
I don &apos;t like both of them .
Tom &apos;s in love with Mary &apos;s best friend .
Go on .
How &apos;s your brother ?
I can &apos;t speak to Tom .
Hurry up . You &apos;ll be late for school .
Close the door , please .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
I &apos;m really rich .
When was she born ?
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
You have many books .
Tom just doesn &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m not a fool .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew how to speak French ?
It &apos;s not as hot today as it was yesterday .
If you change your mind , let me know .
You can &apos;t seat Tom next to Mary .
The house was silent .
You must eat .
Tom says it &apos;s important for us to be there tomorrow .
I know none of them .
I want to stay longer .
Tom and Mary went to Boston with their children last weekend .
These glasses do not fit me well . They are too large .
I don &apos;t want to be here .
She cooks well .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Tom hasn &apos;t bought bread yet .
Can you walk ?
He wondered why she did not come .
Tom tried .
Nobody in the world wants war .
Don &apos;t go away .
I &apos;m too busy to help him .
What are you sorry for ?
I &apos;m feeling fine , thanks .
Tom saw Mary sitting alone at her desk .
It was a question none of us could answer .
Tom and Mary have finished their work .
He is likely to come .
Can I talk to you a moment ?
I have nothing to do today .
You &apos;ll be in danger .
You don &apos;t have to apologize .
Tom eats more food than Mary does .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to his advice ?
I prefer that dress to this one .
Why did you leave Tom alone ?
I need lots of time .
You must believe me .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
It &apos;s time to eat lunch .
It rained for three days .
Tom did what he was told .
Tom didn &apos;t have a chance .
Both of my parents are dead .
Who is able to explain this to me ?
They invited her to go to the party .
I think about you all day long .
Tom opened his book .
I asked what was wrong .
You &apos;ve got time right now , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t often do that .
Tom and Mary are older than John .
What time do you go to work ?
I &apos;m very tall .
You guys are dangerous .
Let me know how it goes .
We have had more snow than usual this winter .
That &apos;s mine .
She is just as beautiful as her mother .
Please drive carefully .
Tom said he &apos;d be there .
I think that car is Tom &apos;s .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
I didn &apos;t see anyone in the room but Tom .
I &apos;m married now .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming .
We may as well wait .
She loves him .
You forgot my birthday .
Can you explain your answer ?
I learned to play guitar when I was ten years old .
Take your time . There &apos;s no rush .
Tomorrow may be too late .
You don &apos;t need to answer that question .
Dinner is usually not ready until six o &apos;clock .
He &apos;s about the same age as you are .
Tom watches TV every night .
This one is full .
I also like cake .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Would you like to eat something ?
So what are you implying ?
What are you going to get ?
Tom and Mary already know each other .
Have you ever written a book ?
She is proud of never having been late for school .
Today is not your day .
I &apos;m talking to one of my students .
She bought him a camera .
He will be talking with his family at this time tomorrow .
I &apos;ve got friends in Boston .
Tom is a father .
Money is not everything .
I know the reason , but I can &apos;t tell you .
This dress is too big for me .
Tom isn &apos;t feeling well .
Tom is very sick .
I didn &apos;t know you were going to be here today .
Tom told Mary that he was in love with Alice .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
That belongs to me .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
Where &apos;s my lunch ?
She tried to swim .
He &apos;s already left .
I don &apos;t know why I keep doing that .
People need love .
My father suggested that we go to the movies this afternoon .
The bus is coming .
Tom is almost always correct .
Tom can &apos;t do that .
She couldn &apos;t afford it .
I &apos;d rather not eat now .
This is none of your business .
Tom intends to go regardless of the weather .
Tom doesn &apos;t always do what others expect .
She wanted me to come .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to leave .
I haven &apos;t yet finished my homework .
Tom was enraged .
I know what it is .
He retired to his own room after supper .
Tom isn &apos;t coming home with us .
Everything is gone .
They were never alone .
I want to hold your hand .
If I were rich , I &apos;d give you money .
Tom never talks to Mary anymore .
We only have one year to get this done .
It wasn &apos;t an accident .
Tom left a few minutes ago .
No one ever came to see me in the hospital .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
I didn &apos;t want to come , but I had no choice .
I want you to be happy .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
Let me go just once .
We can talk about it later .
Why are you doing this ?
It turned out that I was right .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t have done that .
You don &apos;t know that .
I have Tom &apos;s key .
I &apos;ll be there Monday .
He told me that his father was a doctor .
My name &apos;s Tom , too .
I like to walk in the country .
It is no use crying over spilt milk .
I think you might be right .
How does he do this ?
I have as much time as you do .
Do you have children ?
I will do anything but that .
What would you like me to make you for dinner ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like speaking French .
I think I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
It &apos;s not Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t that dumb .
Tom knew everything .
You &apos;re way too late .
Did you find your keys ?
Tom wants to do it .
Won &apos;t you sit down ?
Tom did it himself .
Can you spare me a few minutes ?
Do you know why I gave it to you ?
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom slept in the car .
There &apos;s enough food for all of you .
Have you guys seen Tom ?
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
When did you get back home ?
I hope you approve .
Why are you so nervous ?
Everyone had a good year .
Tom put the book aside .
I know what &apos;s going on here .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
We need some money .
I &apos;ve known that a long time .
Did you make it ?
We &apos;ve been asked to leave .
Talk to me .
When was it you first met Tom ?
She asked him questions .
Would you like to come with us ?
I spoke to Tom myself .
Are you in Boston ?
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
I study French every day .
Let &apos;s cut to the chase .
I &apos;ve already told Tom all I know .
You look a bit better today .
He &apos;s wanted by the police .
I don &apos;t like this .
When did you first meet him ?
Tom says he &apos;ll come at once .
I didn &apos;t arrive until it was too late .
I want to believe you .
Is the door open ?
We didn &apos;t go to Boston .
They approve .
I think he &apos;s interested in you .
Nobody did anything .
I don &apos;t particularly like Tom .
I think Tom could learn a lot from you .
Tom asked the teacher some questions .
He sat on the bench .
Tom looked well .
He is in great trouble .
Tom went out of the room .
Why do people kill themselves ?
Is Tom awake ?
I &apos;ll come back later .
Tom is nearby .
How is it made ?
He has many friends .
There was a girl in Tom &apos;s car .
He can &apos;t make a decision .
Tom was late again this morning .
I don &apos;t want to do this with you .
When will he be back ?
Tom needs to get ready for school .
Isn &apos;t Tom your brother ?
Let me do it .
Are you busy now ?
Be careful not to hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
Why are people afraid of you ?
I wish I &apos;d eaten more .
You don &apos;t know where he is .
What will we do when she finds us ?
I don &apos;t know anything .
I get the picture .
Can you leave it with me till this afternoon ?
You &apos;re worried .
Tom reads the paper every morning .
Everything that Tom said is true .
That &apos;s better , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom asked Mary to brew some coffee .
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
No one can help you .
They are both good teachers .
Tom &apos;s only pretending to be drunk .
How many boys are in this class ?
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
Are you sure you want to do this by yourself ?
Where are you taking me ?
Tom never seems to have much to say .
Do your homework .
It is possible that you have already read this book .
Tom has done that .
What do you have planned for the afternoon ?
When are you coming to see me ?
Can you open it ?
I remember how angry you made me .
My sister is too young to go to school .
Tom &apos;s car was stolen last week .
I have to answer this letter right away .
Why do you want to live in Australia ?
I &apos;m not going to go there .
I was born here .
Tom is scared .
Nobody likes them .
I prefer not to talk about it .
He goes there every day .
Would you explain it again ?
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will go .
My brother has been living in London for many years .
You scare me .
What has Tom seen ?
I haven &apos;t forgotten Tom .
You don &apos;t look sick .
You &apos;d better not tell anyone .
He is afraid of death .
I remember the word .
Why do you want to learn French ?
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
My house is small .
Just go back to bed .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Do you think so ?
Nobody knows where he has gone .
It doesn &apos;t make much difference .
She gave him a present .
Tom didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
Stop what you &apos;re doing .
I &apos;m in my apartment .
Tom told him .
I had to do it before 2 : 30 .
Tom isn &apos;t lost .
I would ask him if I were you .
There &apos;s no need to go to school today .
I don &apos;t worry about Tom .
What &apos;ll you eat for dinner tonight ?
That doesn &apos;t concern me .
I &apos;m not sure about that . It depends .
Tom never agrees with Mary .
The boys were quiet .
I &apos;m here to have fun .
Tom said he was ready to leave .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
Tom has no intention of going there by himself .
Do you know who I am ?
That &apos;s how it should be .
What a beautiful city !
How many does he want ?
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston .
It &apos;s about time to go to school .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston with me ?
It doesn &apos;t look too hard .
I know about you and Tom .
Tom is permitted to do that .
I &apos;m looking forward to tomorrow night .
I think you &apos;re right .
Tom has a son named John .
Did you really do that ?
I can &apos;t study at home .
Is Tom sick ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like talking about his feelings .
I ride a bike to work .
I have to go . It &apos;s getting late .
I &apos;m going to need help .
A fire broke out inside the movie theater .
He &apos;s studying .
Speaking in French is fun .
Is there something we can do for you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do that .
Take Tom .
I &apos;ve learned a good deal from you .
She walks .
Tom just doesn &apos;t listen .
Water is important for people .
I know your language .
I &apos;d like to know why you &apos;re here .
Children should be allowed to be children .
Thanks for coming .
Thank you for the tea .
Why are you going out ?
He says he likes flowers .
Who gave that to you ?
Can he see us ?
I &apos;m not as heavy as Tom .
Tom knew what Mary wanted to buy .
Tom will do that again today .
I know them .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t looking at Mary .
If it rains tomorrow , I &apos;m not going to the meeting .
You know what Tom wants .
You told me that before .
Where did you find the key ?
I &apos;m going to give you one last chance .
I have a dictionary .
Nobody can understand me .
Have you eaten yet ?
Why is she here ?
We &apos;re not done yet .
If you aren &apos;t there by 10 : 00 , we &apos;ll leave without you .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
I &apos;m not that hungry right now .
How did the party go ?
Tom was thirty when he died .
He asked me to .
Tom came to live here .
What is the price ?
Could you please do that for me ?
I &apos;ll take this coat .
I think Tom wants to stay .
She has to stop smoking .
He was playing tennis all day .
Why is it a good thing ?
I &apos;m going to study English this afternoon .
Today , we have to sleep outdoors .
I don &apos;t see Tom doing that .
That girl looks like her mother .
I know that money isn &apos;t everything .
She &apos;s been in the hospital for a month .
Tom and Mary both like to cook .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you today .
Take Tom &apos;s place .
How long has it been since you heard from him ?
He began singing .
Tom wondered what he was supposed to do .
There are no women here .
You like me , don &apos;t you ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that again .
Tom was busy .
Do you really want to help ?
I would &apos;ve said yes .
Do you want to go somewhere else ?
Aren &apos;t you hot ?
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Tom and I have a daughter .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
I &apos;m not bluffing .
Tom has a lot of money in the bank .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m too tired to help him .
Do you think I &apos;m happy ?
They were fine .
I thought Tom was married .
How is Tom now ?
Can I stay ?
You are not to blame for the accident .
He turned out to be her father .
My uncle lives next to the school .
She is putting on weight .
Last night I was at home .
I only hope that that &apos;s enough .
I go to school by bicycle even when it &apos;s raining .
I grabbed my little sister &apos;s hand and started running .
You are tired , and so am I .
That &apos;s a very good question .
If you don &apos;t want to give a speech , you don &apos;t have to .
How can you not like this ?
I heard you were planning to move to Australia .
I &apos;ve never heard Tom speak French .
I feel safe here .
He told her that he loved her .
He called me up almost every day .
I think it &apos;s true .
This bicycle belongs to me .
I wish I could figure out how to get Tom to like me .
He acts like he knows everything .
I &apos;ll buy you a drink .
Tom helped me .
Is Tom alive ?
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
Have another .
Could you open the window ?
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom if I may .
Your plan is a good one .
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t go either .
I &apos;ve fallen in love with somebody else .
I love snow .
You can &apos;t possibly be serious .
Tom doesn &apos;t live far from here .
You have time .
I believe that Tom can do that .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
There &apos;s enough food to go round .
Tom lives all by himself .
He took off his coat and put it on again .
What &apos;re you going to do about it ?
I met her on my way to school .
Tom must be very happy .
Thank you for your gift .
This rarely happens .
Do you want to drink anything ?
He will be here soon .
Tom says that he hasn &apos;t made up his mind yet .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
Who saw you ?
Tom can &apos;t possibly be serious .
No one saw Tom take it .
They will help .
Tom has a girl back home .
You &apos;re right , I think .
Tom never stays more than a week .
Tom made a dress for Mary .
This is my plan .
How long do you think we &apos;ll have to wait ?
Tom and Mary are going to get married .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
Can you play tennis ?
Tom remained behind .
The two friends got on well together .
I &apos;ll stay home and study .
I like to take my children to the beach .
Where did you get this ?
His advice didn &apos;t help at all .
I didn &apos;t want to do it again .
He can &apos;t handle it .
The bus is full . You &apos;ll have to wait for the next one .
Tom fell out of the tree .
What a woman !
We &apos;ll take care of that later .
I used to go to school with him .
It &apos;s necessary for you to go .
Tom loves it .
It &apos;s not a good time .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
Tom and Mary are happy .
Can your mother drive a car ?
I &apos;m listening .
It is very hot today .
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
Let &apos;s do only one thing at a time .
We can do it right now .
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden .
Tom told me about it .
Speaking English isn &apos;t easy .
You &apos;re beginning to scare me .
You &apos;re free to go .
Tom is interested .
Tom stayed close .
How well do you sing ?
Do you remember what you said ?
The weather here is getting cold and I really do not like that .
We don &apos;t have much time .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
Are you for or against the war ?
Could you repeat that , please ?
I know Tom had nothing to do with that .
Someone should talk to him and tell him what &apos;s what .
I could imagine that .
Has anybody spoken to Tom ?
What will my parents think ?
I want a person who can speak French .
You have to show me what to do .
The TV doesn &apos;t work .
This bus will take you to the airport .
Tom called me a taxi .
I can only speak for myself .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m not Tom .
We must make a new start .
This is bad for business .
Did you say yes ?
You &apos;re too small .
Do you really want me to leave ?
Tom can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
It may rain tomorrow .
You must be careful .
It was just as I thought .
Do you want to take it ?
Will you have some more tea ?
I waited for ten minutes .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
Can you take me home now ?
Don &apos;t be angry with me .
It &apos;s no secret that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She &apos;ll be having dinner with him at this time tomorrow .
I &apos;m one of your students .
Many of my friends can speak French .
What do you want to tell us ?
He really likes playing the guitar .
Do you think children born today will have better lives than their parents ?
He &apos;s good at what he does .
I &apos;d like to do what you do .
It &apos;s probably true .
Don &apos;t you have two computers ?
I wasn &apos;t busy yesterday .
I &apos;ve got to leave soon .
Is Tom hungry ?
We &apos;ll go see Tom .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he returns home .
It is very cold today .
We generally drink tea after a meal .
Tom teaches us French .
I am seeing Mary this afternoon .
Friends are always willing to help each other .
Let &apos;s eat out .
Tom has been here for three days .
Tom has young children .
Tom wants to learn how to swim .
I don &apos;t have a very good dictionary .
I don &apos;t like his way of talking .
This is just what I wanted .
We know how they are .
I found this movie very interesting .
I should have come earlier .
What does Tom want to eat ?
Tom wasn &apos;t nice .
How did you find me ?
Tom knew better .
I haven &apos;t seen him lately .
Tom heard something and went to find out what it was .
It &apos;s not my day .
The dog began to run .
Tom is willing to do almost anything for money .
My life would be meaningless without you .
He carried a bag full of apples .
Tom says you want to go to Boston with us .
This isn &apos;t mine .
We sure had fun , didn &apos;t we ?
I was so worried about you .
I &apos;m studying French .
Tom might be able to help us .
I &apos;m coming to you .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
Tom said he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
Tom was sitting on the table .
He came back soon .
He is still here .
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Can you help us ?
I want to give this to Tom .
This is simply not true .
Tom has a thing for Mary .
Did you see Tom leave ?
I &apos;ll never forget .
I have no clue what I &apos;m doing .
Did you call Tom ?
What can I do for you this evening ?
She is friendly to everybody .
Is this love ?
Do you know how to drive a car ?
I was nervous the whole time .
Give them a couple of minutes .
I can &apos;t see anything .
The boy cannot keep quiet for ten minutes .
Tom said that he loved me , too .
This is going to take a while .
I never wanted to do this .
Where are you on Monday ?
Tom has written to me .
The bus stopped .
Do you know why that happens ?
Tom was in the hospital .
I &apos;ll stop .
Tom seems to be happy .
I &apos;m not nervous .
These shoes are a little loose .
Tom is very proud of his students .
He &apos;s not my father .
You must apologize to Tom .
I tried to be like you .
I don &apos;t get it .
Tom came here by bicycle .
I don &apos;t know how else to explain it .
Is this what I think it is ?
I believe I can help you find Tom .
I wish you had let Tom go with us .
It looks like Tom decided to stay .
Tom is about half Mary &apos;s age .
I wonder why Tom said that .
I read the report you wrote .
It made me think of Tom .
Tom has remarried .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all swim .
He must have been rich .
Tom quickly got to work .
I didn &apos;t know about the party .
There was a cat on the table .
What is he saying ?
Where are you taking us ?
Is that car yours ?
Tom doesn &apos;t take vacations .
What &apos;ll you give me ?
There is someone here .
I hope he isn &apos;t ill .
Is this bag yours or his ?
I will make her happy .
I know you have a girlfriend .
Why didn &apos;t you call me earlier ?
I wish I was with you .
It &apos;s winter in Australia .
I &apos;m hungry !
He said that he was very happy .
Tom is thinking about what happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston .
I can &apos;t eat any more .
An apple fell to the ground .
Tom might be sick .
Tom didn &apos;t even shake my hand .
The old man is taking a walk in the park .
Has Tom returned ?
I can &apos;t imagine my life without you .
We must try again .
That &apos;s not how we think .
I wish I had more .
Tom wasn &apos;t listening .
We &apos;re moving to Australia .
Do you have time ?
Tom is disappointed .
Let &apos;s go and see Tom .
Tom , it doesn &apos;t work that way .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary .
My kids are coming to see me .
I want to know what you think .
I &apos;ve never heard such a thing .
I &apos;m not a kid anymore .
We made a decision .
He is strong as a horse .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it .
Her plan is dangerous .
You &apos;re a good person .
Tom might object .
When did it begin to rain ?
Not everything can be bought with money .
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week .
Do you expect me to believe that ?
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
Have you spoken to your parents about this ?
I want to know how you did it .
We can do a lot better .
Let &apos;s play something .
We must get back to the ship .
The question was too difficult to answer .
The cat is not dead .
We &apos;ll get it .
I really am busy .
Beer &apos;s good .
We need to speak with you .
This hat is a little too small for me .
Tom never found out the truth .
Tom is thinking .
She has many dogs .
Tom drove me to the airport .
I did what I could .
There is no reason for me to apologize .
Did you invite Tom ?
When did you start learning French ?
You seemed to enjoy doing that .
He couldn &apos;t find the house .
Tom is not as good-looking as Mary .
Are you still interested in learning how to speak French ?
How many years have you two been married ?
You know where it is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom likes to play with my dog .
The story is very interesting to me .
Tom wanted to help his friends .
These are new .
Tom began to talk .
I &apos;ve always played with my brother .
How many flowers did you buy ?
Don &apos;t say things like that .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV .
I feel so lost .
If you don &apos;t keep your promises , people won &apos;t take you seriously .
This book belongs to me .
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is .
I know Tom is in Boston .
She has three kids .
It was hard for Tom to get his homework done on time .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason .
I don &apos;t know what to sing .
Do you know who wrote this book ?
Tom is doing quite well in school .
Tom looks more like a teacher than a student .
You are no longer a child .
I just want to be alone .
Aren &apos;t you going to study French ?
I &apos;m busy right now , Tom .
Tom thought nobody was at home .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
He lives across the street .
You &apos;re not answering the question .
That girl looks like Mary .
He need not have run so fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom isn &apos;t old enough to understand this .
How come you never told me you were from Boston ?
Tom wants to leave .
I &apos;m positive .
They don &apos;t understand French .
She is not less beautiful than her sister .
We were caught off guard .
Tom just called .
You work hard .
I absolutely agree with you .
This is the watch I bought yesterday .
The boys were as nervous as the girls .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
I met my friend on the street .
Is everybody happy ?
I &apos;m on your side , Tom .
He is as tall as his father .
We almost never eat out .
Do you want to make me happy ?
I asked Tom where he and Mary had first met each other .
Tom put his coat back on .
That &apos;s what I like .
The room is full of people .
A cat has been on the table .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
Tom lives abroad .
I haven &apos;t asked Tom yet .
What are you doing here ?
Tom and I are with Mary .
I think Tom needs your help .
You &apos;re not very hungry , are you ?
It &apos;s important to read books .
That &apos;s not even funny .
Did you talk to Tom ?
She arrived too early .
If I were you , I would buy it .
Did Tom hurt you ?
I just want to let you know that I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
It is their only choice .
This is Tom &apos;s knife .
What are you doing here so late at night ?
He must be tired .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
They &apos;re coming again .
Do you think we should abandon ship ?
What time is your train ?
Everyone is against me .
Are you free this afternoon ?
I &apos;m still a little hungry .
That &apos;s what Tom does .
They eat meat once a week .
He is liked by everybody .
I can do it by myself !
I &apos;m not interested in talking to her .
What do you think about that ?
Did Tom take last week off ?
Most of them were college students .
Tom didn &apos;t drive Mary home .
I do realize that .
I &apos;m nothing without you .
She &apos;s a dog .
Tom will succeed .
I want you to read it .
This is Tom &apos;s cat .
Have you eaten ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
All of us can speak French .
I &apos;ve been doing that since about 2 : 30 .
You will have to apologize when you see him .
I want to come , too .
That &apos;s what they do .
See you at home .
What is truth ?
Tom said he needed more money .
I didn &apos;t need to pay for the food .
Where did they learn this ?
What you need is a friend .
I love you more than ever .
Maybe Tom is in the hospital .
Tom had fun with it .
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t do that ?
I brought you some coffee .
I &apos;d love to stay .
He is a head taller than me .
All these books are mine .
Tom isn &apos;t planning to stay .
Did Tom call while I was out ?
When will we reach the airport ?
I don &apos;t know who that boy is .
Tom is very tall .
Time &apos;s up .
Can you give my brother a job ?
The work is well worth the trouble .
Tom was completely clueless .
I &apos;ll be back at six .
Did you read it at all ?
Have you tried it before ?
I arrived in London .
There &apos;s a lot of work to do .
I would like to buy a sofa .
Your French is really good . Where did you study ?
What do women want ?
Everyone loves him .
I know that all of this is just a game .
I can do this myself .
He has gone to America .
I &apos;ll see to it .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
I &apos;m in love .
I &apos;m looking forward to visiting your country this winter .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
I &apos;m the same height as he is .
I am okay .
Didn &apos;t you like the movie ?
Tom said he heard Mary &apos;s voice .
It &apos;s none of my business !
There is a key on the desk .
You like it , don &apos;t you ?
I want to go there by myself .
How long is too long ?
Tom lives alone .
Many college students don &apos;t have a lot of money .
I thought I told you to handle this yourself .
Tom writes well .
Are you still mad at me ?
It sickens me .
I &apos;d like to see you if possible .
Tom worked there .
I &apos;ll get that .
Tom didn &apos;t think Mary would enjoy his party .
What do you want here ?
Give me that book .
We know who did it .
It &apos;s too far to walk .
When do you have to do that ?
It &apos;s been three years since the accident .
He was lucky .
I believed what Tom said .
You can &apos;t make everyone happy all the time .
I bought the book for myself , not for my wife .
Tom was the last person to finish eating .
The place was totally deserted .
Tom has been hurt .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom who my father was .
How do you do this ?
Tom never listens to the teacher .
Did Tom help his mother yesterday ?
Tom said that he could swim well .
You were happy .
You can &apos;t imagine how hungry I was .
She hit him again and again .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
Where did you learn to drive ?
Do you know how to dance ?
Is it really all over ?
It works well .
I am going to write a letter .
Let me pay for your coffee .
I tried to help him .
I think we have enough .
Are you busy ?
We have a problem .
Could we meet privately ?
Tom ate lunch at home .
I forget his name .
Tom is very nice to me .
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston .
Everything &apos;s going to be fine .
He is young .
We &apos;d like that .
Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
I &apos;m not like you .
Tom is wrong as usual .
Is Tom hungry ?
I can &apos;t give you that .
We found Tom .
Tom and I got married in Australia three years ago .
Tom is going to do that .
It &apos;s no secret that Tom doesn &apos;t agree with you .
Why are you so tired ?
Tom has just left .
Tom went back home .
Tom already understands that .
Tom wasn &apos;t very hungry .
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
Tom pointed at something on the ground .
We &apos;re having fun .
He looks older than my brother .
Has he arrived yet ?
How do you like Australia ?
It isn &apos;t here anymore .
He works very hard .
I &apos;ll come when I have done my homework .
Leave this to me .
We &apos;ll deal with it tomorrow .
How do you know about that ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s idea .
I &apos;m here with my family .
Tom said yes .
We need to leave .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Look who &apos;s there .
They want me .
She studies English .
I don &apos;t have to ask anyone .
Children often want to do things that are dangerous without knowing that they are dangerous .
I would like to have this camera .
Tom teaches French to children .
I think I hurt his feelings .
Tom can &apos;t afford a new car .
I thought Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
We don &apos;t have school tomorrow .
Tom has been sick for a long time .
Do you know what she said ?
How do we get rid of Tom ?
I only saw Tom once .
Today , I &apos;m not going to school .
When do you want to go ?
Tom knows nothing about Boston .
He will not stay for more than four days .
My birthday was last week .
The old man sometimes talks to himself .
You didn &apos;t have to come into the office today .
I speak English a lot .
I went to bed very late .
I can come at three .
Did you call Tom ?
My bag was stolen .
I &apos;ll write a letter to Tom .
You &apos;re very beautiful .
Everything matters .
Are you aware of how much she loves you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary didn &apos;t come to the party .
Tom is just like you .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2 : 30 .
How can you be so calm ?
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Tom didn &apos;t have any money .
I can &apos;t run very fast .
Many university students don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Tom is the only student at this school that Mary knows .
I &apos;m feeling good this morning .
I &apos;d like to talk about your situation .
Tom doesn &apos;t work for us anymore .
This is not for you .
Give some meat to the dog .
What does Tom want from us ?
I never had a car .
I &apos;d like to stand .
I need the keys .
I &apos;d like to take this with me .
Who is that man ?
I play the piano a little .
My business is prospering .
What &apos;s your cat &apos;s name ?
Is this dog Tom &apos;s ?
Tom needs a friend .
Don &apos;t leave me alone .
I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Why should Tom sing ?
I see why you don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom is a high school student .
Let &apos;s have dinner .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
I can &apos;t talk now . I &apos;m too busy .
You don &apos;t know how to speak French very well , do you ?
It &apos;s time for us to go .
You can &apos;t blame him for the accident .
He wanted to come with us .
She baked me a cake .
You &apos;re not young anymore .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night .
You know Tom is telling the truth .
I found my car missing .
Is anyone else hungry ?
I can &apos;t go alone .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
I heard her singing .
My sister didn &apos;t help me .
He &apos;ll be along in ten minutes .
Money does not always bring happiness .
I don &apos;t go to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
We know that Tom is here .
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
Will you let Tom leave ?
I should &apos;ve stayed at home today .
I was just having a little fun .
I have a dog .
Tom just doesn &apos;t get it .
It was your mistake , not mine .
I lost sight of her in the crowd .
Everybody knows that .
Tom has been out of work for over a month .
Where did you get that ?
I &apos;d like to go cycling .
You &apos;re very good at this .
Will you have another glass of wine ?
You &apos;re still in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
You should have done so .
I didn &apos;t have a job .
I barely know you .
I like how you think .
When does Tom walk his dog ?
Are you surprised that I came ?
Tom never arrived .
Tom slept .
What do you think happened here ?
He &apos;s too young to understand .
Tom has to be hot .
This is all my fault .
I sort of understand .
That &apos;ll be difficult .
I want to do something with my life .
I don &apos;t feel like watching TV .
I didn &apos;t do it for you .
Who will do it ?
Tom is going to be very good .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
Did you write this book ?
Tomorrow is my birthday .
Tom will wait .
I now know why Tom did what he did .
I can &apos;t see a thing .
That &apos;s easy to say , but it &apos;s not easy to do .
I should never have listened to you .
Do you have two computers ?
How are they doing it ?
I don &apos;t like to study languages .
May I ask about your family ?
I don &apos;t know where Tom will do that .
You may use my car .
I don &apos;t want to think about death .
Tom could hear Mary , but he couldn &apos;t see her .
Do you know what his name is ?
That &apos;s not good enough .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
I &apos;m not my father .
I &apos;d like a little more time .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
I &apos;m very happy for you .
What has he done ?
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
This is theirs .
You &apos;ve earned it .
No one listened to me .
Tom said Mary was very drunk .
Tom is still in the hospital .
I saw a boy swimming across the river .
I need some help with my work .
This tree is older than I am .
I think that you are correct .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t done that .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
What are you guys going to play ?
Did you ever talk to him ?
There &apos;s nobody at the door .
I &apos;m a little tired .
You look very tired .
It &apos;s your home .
I &apos;m not going to tell you where Tom is .
I &apos;m going home now .
Don &apos;t you want to see your room ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
That hurts ! Stop it !
Tom has no one to help him .
I don &apos;t have a family yet .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was so happy .
I think I &apos;ve got it .
They were afraid of the big dog .
I can &apos;t hear a word .
Tom &apos;s been looking for you .
Come home at six .
You have a lot of books .
Are you ready , Tom ?
There were a lot of people at the party .
You can &apos;t expect more than that .
Tom told me Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom isn &apos;t in a joking mood .
Tom wanted to know where Mary was .
The price is up to you .
Your mother would be proud of you .
I &apos;m going to be a father .
He believes that the story is true .
Tom was surprised that Mary already knew about what happened .
How does Tom do it ?
I felt cold .
Tom has a son named John .
Can I pay later ?
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
You have to do as I say .
When I hear that song , I think about when I was young .
Maybe we should talk .
I &apos;m not sure I want to do this .
I think we have to go .
Let &apos;s play tennis after school .
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
Why don &apos;t you come to Boston ?
You alone can help me .
I really don &apos;t understand what &apos;s so funny .
Tom deserves more .
I have a few friends in the United States .
You have to help me .
I &apos;ll leave you two alone .
When do we have to do that ?
Tom did his homework in the kitchen .
I asked him what his name was .
Tom can &apos;t be right about everything .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want that .
I don &apos;t like your dog .
I &apos;m not hungry anymore .
I want Tom to leave .
I don &apos;t want to go outside .
You haven &apos;t said anything to Tom , have you ?
There isn &apos;t any film in this camera .
Tom tried to leave , but Mary wouldn &apos;t let him .
I didn &apos;t meet anyone there .
Tom is in the building .
I keep asking myself that .
I thought you said you were bad at French .
Tom may stay .
You need it .
He &apos;s almost always in the hospital .
We should go to sleep .
I &apos;ve told you everything .
This question is too difficult for me to answer .
I may be able to help you .
I love coffee .
I don &apos;t quite know yet .
What will become of his children after his death ?
We know all that .
I visited Tom in Boston three years ago .
I suppose you like him .
I didn &apos;t have to tell Tom . He already knew .
Where does Tom live now ?
We can &apos;t help Tom now .
Tom has a daughter about your age .
I &apos;m planning to go to bed early tonight .
I didn &apos;t mean it .
Are you here to see me ?
Will you marry me ?
Have you decided what to do yet ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
Tom thought that Mary loved him .
Let me see .
Tom is dying to see Mary .
Tom is back again .
Do you want to leave ?
He accepted our offer .
Tom is like a brother to me .
I went to Tom &apos;s house after school .
Tom may be out .
I don &apos;t see why everyone thinks this book is so good .
There &apos;s no water .
The police are there .
Do you have everything ?
I like Boston , too .
I have more than one friend who can &apos;t swim .
Tom stole my money .
He &apos;s about the same age as you .
I think you &apos;re ready .
Your time is up .
I finished writing the report .
Today is my birthday .
Tom was probably right .
You &apos;re worrying too much .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
I don &apos;t know if she will come .
I wanted to learn French .
If it rains tomorrow , we &apos;ll not go there .
Aren &apos;t you interested ?
I could &apos;ve met you at the airport .
How &apos;s your wife ?
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear Mary .
Tom saw us do that .
Tom came from a good home .
You may take either of the books .
Do you know who said that ?
Tom would do anything to win .
Where is the railroad station ?
Why are you so nervous ?
I don &apos;t even know your name .
I haven &apos;t been in Australia very long .
Didn &apos;t you like the movie ?
Do you have any idea what &apos;s wrong ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
Is that what Tom said ?
Maybe we can help Tom .
You may still do it if you want to .
You lost .
Tom is pretty much finished .
Where did you get to know her ?
Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I have a lot of things to tell you .
How long have you been studying English ?
Can you stay for a few days ?
I think that boy &apos;s name is Tom .
I &apos;ve known Tom for more than thirty years .
She plays tennis after school every day .
I only think of you .
The milk turned sour .
The boy is tall for his age .
They were better than I expected .
Someone might get hurt .
What else can you do ?
She can &apos;t have written it herself .
Here &apos;s a letter for you .
I told you so .
You don &apos;t work here .
Pay attention to what Tom is saying .
I made tea .
Tom is three years old now .
Stop telling me what to do . You &apos;re not my mom .
I can &apos;t drive Tom to school today .
We learned how to read French in school , but didn &apos;t really learn how to speak it .
She gave it to me .
What &apos;s Tom given us ?
She earns half as much money as her husband .
I want to learn that song .
I was just joking .
Do you want to come ?
It &apos;s close to my house .
Tom can swim .
He has already finished his work .
If Tom said it , it &apos;s probably true .
What is it that you want from me ?
You are making history .
Tom is too busy to go today .
Would you like it now ?
I am certain that he will pass the exam .
To me , it is important .
Can &apos;t you just ask Tom to help us ?
This is the boy .
You know who they are .
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
We &apos;re listening .
We &apos;re leaving tonight .
We &apos;re not going , are we ?
What do you want to do now ?
Tom has been living in Boston for almost ten years .
We had no idea what we should do .
Tom is here , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m happy that Tom is here .
I think you should visit him .
I was there .
Tom got home a couple of hours ago .
You don &apos;t look so good .
That &apos;s what I said .
I hope to see you .
This is different from what I thought .
How long do you plan on staying in this country ?
Tom has to go with Mary .
I &apos;m sure Tom is just fine .
We haven &apos;t seen anyone .
Why didn &apos;t you phone before coming ?
Tom has to stop doing this .
I &apos;ll take that .
This isn &apos;t new .
Tom gave me another chance .
Give me three more apples .
I don &apos;t have a problem .
It was too easy .
I don &apos;t like the house which he lives in .
Tom sat next to me .
Are you a good dancer ?
The rain lasted four days .
I think I &apos;ll take that one .
Tom actually did what he said he &apos;d do .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
Everything is OK .
He paid no attention to my advice .
Can you direct me to the train station ?
He is no longer living here .
How much is it worth to you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what got into Mary .
The future will come soon enough .
He doesn &apos;t know English .
I made these .
Tom has a lot of work to do this week .
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
Do you think Tom is coming to the party ?
I always make this mistake .
Is this car new ?
What does this mean ?
That &apos;s one of mine .
I didn &apos;t see anyone writing .
It must be here .
He speaks poor French .
We couldn &apos;t see a thing .
It &apos;s really very easy to do that .
You gave it to us .
I don &apos;t want to eat here .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to Tom ?
Tom wants a watch like yours .
I like winter .
Tom speaks slowly .
I have a present for you .
I go to school every morning .
Open your eyes .
Tom only knows how to speak French .
Can I come ?
He can read .
She doesn &apos;t understand you .
Could you please wait until I &apos;m finished ?
He speaks five languages .
Tom seems calm .
No one is saying that .
Tom was sitting next to me .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t know French .
He can swim well .
Are you a student here ?
I think that you &apos;re right .
She was alone there .
How long ago was that ?
I can &apos;t believe it . Tom can &apos;t believe it either .
This school has many students .
I agreed with her .
We &apos;re sorry about it .
Everything seemed to be OK .
You &apos;ve got to stop , Tom .
It has never been done before .
I wonder why he was absent .
Tom was carrying two suitcases , one in each hand .
I &apos;ll get these .
He looked at her angrily .
Have you called her yet ?
Those children are waiting for their mother .
She said that I should come home soon .
I &apos;m not very happy .
There is a car in front of the building .
We have a lot to do .
You can &apos;t be serious ?
He always tells the truth .
I can &apos;t believe that I &apos;m really here .
You know me .
I won &apos;t let you out of my sight .
I think I can help Tom with his homework .
I &apos;m a busy guy .
I want someone to tell me why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
He will pay for everything .
Tom said that he &apos;ll do that in a couple of days .
I like meat better than fish .
What &apos;re your plans for the weekend ?
Tom brought that .
How about this one ?
He has a car .
He has money .
How much did you pay for that ?
He fell asleep while reading a book .
Here is a letter for you .
I think I know what this is .
It &apos;s rather cold .
I think your English has improved a lot .
I &apos;ll explain everything .
You &apos;re a good mom .
That &apos;s true .
Tom put a cup of coffee on the table in front of Mary .
I was trying to talk to you .
Tom has been in prison for a long time .
When does the next train leave ?
Tom wondered where Mary learned to do that .
I hope you &apos;re hungry .
I was just scared .
I must know the truth .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
Tom can &apos;t talk .
I &apos;d like some more bread , please .
Don &apos;t you want to come along ?
There &apos;s a restaurant pretty close to here , but it &apos;s not very good .
We &apos;re going ahead with this .
It is in the kitchen .
They won &apos;t come until tomorrow .
You &apos;re driving too fast .
I don &apos;t know whether to go or to stay .
Tom appeared intoxicated .
You &apos;re always welcome here .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
How often do you eat out ?
Tom wants to know why .
They aren &apos;t happy to see you .
Is your wife tall ?
It doesn &apos;t matter what she said .
This dress looks good on you .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
Tom wanted people to like him .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom has no children .
I always wanted to have a dog .
Tom asked Mary where the dog was .
There appears to have been an accident .
Tom is trying to help you .
What exactly has Tom done ?
She brought up the three children alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that &apos;s true .
I &apos;m older than you think I am .
I feel lost without you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where his keys are .
He loves you very much .
Have you asked the others ?
I do hope so .
I &apos;ve seen it with my own eyes .
I often study while listening to music .
It doesn &apos;t look so bad .
The meeting is about to start .
You eat more food than I do .
He laid his bag on the table .
I &apos;d like to ask you about a student of yours .
We watch TV every day .
It &apos;s me .
How long are you going to stay in Japan ?
It looks like Tom is having fun .
My sister is older than my brother .
Tom said you lived in Boston .
Sit down , please .
I don &apos;t have to be here .
I want something to drink now .
I know that you &apos;re disappointed .
We came to play .
How well do you sing ?
I &apos;m still in love with Tom .
The car doesn &apos;t run fast .
He often watches TV .
The movie wasn &apos;t as interesting as I expected it to be .
I &apos;d like you to have this .
Could you tell me something about yourself ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you asked .
We &apos;re not from around here .
I should be done in an hour .
Tom spoke to me in French .
There &apos;s something on the table .
What are you called ?
What are you writing ?
Let &apos;s see if Tom knows more than we do .
You don &apos;t have to worry about a thing like that .
It could happen to anyone .
I just don &apos;t know what to say .
I stayed in Boston for three days .
I thought he wouldn &apos;t come .
I &apos;m busy .
How old do you have to be to drive a car ?
Mary , I love you .
Tom bought this camera for himself , not for his wife .
What does it look like to you ?
She likes to walk alone .
You have to study harder .
Why is Tom not doing that ?
I &apos;ll let you know when it has been decided .
My passport will expire in October .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
What am I going to do with this ?
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
I made a big mistake .
What &apos;s there to do ?
I didn &apos;t know that would happen .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about Tom .
I never eat meat .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to eat much .
Tom told Mary to do that .
No one in the class runs as fast as he does .
Tom should wait .
Why do you want to know what I &apos;m thinking ?
That doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
Tom wants a large family .
Is there any beer left ?
I want you to be with me .
My sister is married .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
Tom knows me .
I think this book is easy .
I wish we had won the game .
That hurts .
You should &apos;ve told me yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll do that .
You &apos;d better go by bus .
I don &apos;t remember her name anymore .
What &apos;s the matter ? Just tell me .
I can &apos;t believe I listened to you .
I won &apos;t be ready .
I know what you &apos;re going to ask .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
I watch TV now and then .
Tom has enough money to buy it .
I asked Tom why he wanted to go to Boston .
I want you to leave now .
I &apos;m getting better at speaking French .
Say what you want to say .
He &apos;s in the kitchen .
I speak French better than I speak English .
What &apos;ll you have for dinner tonight ?
We are at war .
I left the house .
Tom and I did that .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is .
Tom isn &apos;t done .
I do not know whether it is good or not .
Do you want to take that ?
We only have three days left .
Why don &apos;t you come to the party with us ?
Tom hasn &apos;t called yet .
Where have you been all day ?
Did Tom drive to Boston by himself ?
These are my books , and those are his books .
Are those Tom &apos;s shoes ?
I have no time to help you with the work .
I don &apos;t need anyone .
Please tell me what I &apos;m doing wrong .
That isn &apos;t what I want to see .
Your English is improving .
I &apos;m going to need more help .
Tom &apos;s got a tremendous amount of work to do .
I don &apos;t know where Tom lives .
I think it &apos;s a good thing .
I wanted to say thank you for all your help .
Aren &apos;t you Tom ?
There is a glass on the table .
I give my word .
I &apos;ve found something .
He gives an apple to the teacher every day .
I have to know .
I &apos;m your age .
She made him happy .
I was afraid of what people would think .
Tom wants to see you and me .
I &apos;d just like to know if you are coming or not .
I want you to wait for me .
Tom was alone there .
I think you &apos;re both right .
They &apos;re coming home .
I have to go home .
The problem was too difficult for me to solve .
Tom and Mary are completely against it .
She may not come .
Are you in trouble ?
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s suitcase .
Tom found a nice apartment for me .
Tom &apos;s family is rich .
It &apos;s warm today .
My parents were proud of me .
When I was your age , I thought the same way as you about this issue .
I started learning English six years ago .
I made that dress by myself .
Tom left for Australia yesterday .
He is tall .
Tom introduced his sister to me .
I &apos;m going to bed now .
I think that Tom is thirty years old .
What language is spoken in America ?
Tom knew that would happen .
I will not help you .
Tom told me to meet him at his apartment .
Why are you doing this to yourself ?
Come on , wake up .
Where are you from ?
It &apos;ll soon be six o &apos;clock .
I don &apos;t have time to do all the things that need to be done .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
You &apos;re invited .
My advice is to go home .
You can &apos;t leave now .
Tom is going to be right back .
Let &apos;s talk about this later .
I &apos;d never do anything like that .
Tom is very tired .
Here &apos;s a book for your mother to read .
These apples are for Tom .
I played tennis yesterday for the first time .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
I know how many of them there are .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
I think we should just be friends .
I do not understand .
You don &apos;t have to work today .
Isn &apos;t Tom afraid ?
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
I want to ask you about Tom .
I want to stay here with you .
He told me that he would see it once more .
Let &apos;s go home , Tom .
It seems to me that you &apos;re making fun of me .
Thanks for coming , Tom .
Your house is big .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to meet you .
Tom knows we aren &apos;t happy .
How many cats does Tom have ?
Tom has more money than Mary .
Is that too difficult ?
You can &apos;t help Tom .
Are you sure you &apos;re well enough to go to school ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Can you answer this question ?
It doesn &apos;t have a name .
I gave you a book .
I &apos;m out of money .
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary .
How can I get to the station ?
Where do you come from ?
He looks much better now .
Tom wasn &apos;t eating .
They are eating their apples .
They &apos;re late , as usual .
You &apos;ll get your money .
We &apos;re frightened .
Are Tom and Mary with you ?
I don &apos;t know where you work .
What is she doing in his office ?
He &apos;d love to live in the city .
Do you have them ?
I think that &apos;s a huge mistake .
I am busy now and can &apos;t play with you .
How do we find it ?
Everybody loves Tom .
Why did you go to his house ?
I have to quit smoking .
May I ask you something ?
I want my life back .
Stop flirting with me .
Tom waited , but Mary never came back .
Her answer was incorrect .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that again .
I need friends .
I &apos;ve got an idea .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes me .
When Tom &apos;s happy , I &apos;m happy .
Who benefits from this ?
We will do anything for you .
I know what time you said to be there , but I wasn &apos;t able to be there at that time .
I like your hair .
Tom was in Boston last week , wasn &apos;t he ?
Tom does this all the time .
Tom and his wife are from Australia .
Tom almost never gets sick .
It is dangerous to play in the street .
I just spoke with Tom .
I hope Tom is in Boston all next week .
We could do that for you .
Life without love has no meaning at all .
All the boys in class worked hard .
You should do that soon .
Tom , I need your help .
How much did you pay for that ?
That boy won &apos;t tell me his name .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary was the one who did that .
Do you think he will like my gift ?
What are you doing after work ?
Tom can play tennis better than anyone else here .
I &apos;m here for a meeting .
Where &apos;s my family ?
What do they want you to do ?
Tomorrow morning will be OK .
He still wants to come .
Tom told me his job was a lot of fun .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I haven &apos;t heard a word from them in over four years .
We &apos;re all happy .
The boy is kind .
Tom was busy all day .
Tom got the last piece of cake .
He has a big family .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
I &apos;m not that crazy .
He relented .
About how much money do you have ?
It &apos;s up to you , Tom .
Tom knows how to play the piano .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t help each other .
Buy it for me , please .
I have not seen much of him recently .
Mary is mine .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all of Mary &apos;s questions .
This is your dog .
There &apos;s no one here .
When will you come home ?
I think about it sometimes .
Tom and I were both at the meeting .
I don &apos;t know why we let you do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come to my office .
I don &apos;t care what it is .
I &apos;m out of here .
He has already said yes .
He takes a walk every morning .
Tom got married .
I &apos;m sure he will come tomorrow .
We &apos;re not good enough .
He might have missed the last train .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
She is very angry with me .
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a moment .
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
Do you know how many people are here ?
When may I go home ?
I &apos;ll go when I &apos;m ready .
Do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
Don &apos;t go out with Tom .
Where &apos;s the doctor ?
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia ?
I &apos;ll go swimming tomorrow .
Tom did as I told him .
Tom likes good food .
She used to live near him .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
Tom is quite good at cooking .
Tom may not be able to come .
I &apos;m in the park .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
We almost never eat out .
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston .
I have lots of friends .
I talked to friends .
I expect I &apos;ll have to do that for Tom .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
We don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
Tom and Mary are at home today .
Tom waited for Mary to come home .
Tom bought some bread .
The baby needs his mother .
Tom wants to make everyone happy .
Tom is no longer alive .
Tom sat nearby .
I had to walk home .
What do you think it &apos;s for ?
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be able to find it .
Take your time .
I &apos;ll be free this evening .
I love to go to the movies .
I want everyone to hear what I have to say .
I know where it is .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
The room is too small to play in .
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
I have to go to the doctor today .
I wish Tom was here with me today .
He may have missed the last train .
Tom and Mary speak to each other in French .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t always right .
Winter seems to be sticking around a lot longer than usual this year .
Are you still hungry ?
I &apos;m new at this .
Tom met Mary outside .
I think Tom is expecting us both .
I need some good advice .
Tom is very likely to be able to do that .
It &apos;s true that he is in love with her .
Tom had a dog .
Do you want me to tell you how to do that ?
There &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
I bought the book yesterday .
He kept quite calm .
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
Can you hear it ?
Your car is fast .
Can you give me this one , please ?
Do you want to do it with me ?
He is a man of his word .
Tom might not be in Australia anymore .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to like this .
We &apos;ve got something for you .
Tom has more money than I do .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
Are you interested ?
How was your day today ?
There was absolutely nothing you could do about it .
I want to go to the movies today .
Where &apos;s Tom going ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look like John .
Did you like this book ?
Why does Tom want to go with us ?
Anybody knows it .
What has Tom ever done for me ?
Tom often fails to keep his word .
Are you done with your homework yet ?
It seemed too good to be true .
She looked him in the face .
I like her very much .
Where does he work now ?
Has Tom left yet ?
They found us .
You can have as many as you want .
I just have a couple of questions .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
