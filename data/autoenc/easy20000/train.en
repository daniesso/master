We know all that .
What would you do in my place ?
They &apos;re not like us .
Did Tom tell you ?
All we can do is to wait for him .
Tom got home .
You &apos;re like a father to me .
Are you sure that &apos;s what it was ?
Tom will go alone .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
I think Tom isn &apos;t home .
Tell me why you think that .
We have to get back before Tom does .
You &apos;re making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re a man now .
Have you read that book ?
It is not so difficult as you think .
Tom is ready .
Is Tom busy ?
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find work in Boston .
There was a girl in Tom &apos;s car .
Tom knows better .
I think we have enough time .
You can &apos;t tell me what to do .
I knew you &apos;d come .
Did Tom like it in Boston ?
Tom is very fast .
I think I know why Tom didn &apos;t do that .
I love the people here .
There &apos;s another reason .
Tom was really tired .
Tom was so busy .
You &apos;ve got to see her home .
How come you didn &apos;t come ?
What does he expect ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come to my office .
I had fun at school today .
Tom has arrived .
He doesn &apos;t have any children .
I know what it was .
You &apos;re a good father .
I didn &apos;t really know what I was doing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you want .
They &apos;re after you .
Tom is afraid to tell the truth .
I do that , too .
We don &apos;t need to go to school tomorrow .
&quot; What did you tell Tom ? &quot; &quot; I told him the truth . &quot;
He took off his hat .
Tom might be right .
I knew you &apos;d say that .
How did you get into my room ?
Give me a day .
Where would I find books ?
Do you have a phone ?
Tom must be sick .
I have something to ask of you .
I want to go to Boston .
Tom &apos;s father &apos;s name is John .
You are tired , and so am I .
Is this your room ?
I &apos;m thirty .
Do you know why ?
Tom hardly ever speaks to me anymore .
Tom and Mary are getting married next month .
You have a car , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m with Tom .
You should have come to us .
I don &apos;t care what you do .
We lost our cat and Tom found it for us .
You were my friend .
I want to see you as soon as possible .
He is wearing a hat .
I &apos;ve never had to work very hard .
Can I speak in English ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can swim or not .
He didn &apos;t listen to music .
Are these all Tom &apos;s books ?
What would you have said ?
He can do it better than me .
I want to learn how to speak French .
Why don &apos;t you get Tom to do that ?
You eat too much .
Your book is here .
What do we do about Tom ?
I came here to see Tom .
You must be Tom &apos;s mother .
Tom isn &apos;t going to understand .
I &apos;m very sorry I did that .
Come here . I need to tell you something .
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
He is playing in his room .
May I have this book ?
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
This is how I made it .
Tom will never understand why people don &apos;t like him .
She is working on the problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this .
I should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I don &apos;t know what to think of this .
Can your mother drive a car ?
How long did Tom say he &apos;d be in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
No one knows the answer .
I don &apos;t know yet .
You can read French , can &apos;t you ?
Give that to Tom .
I have a few books .
I won &apos;t help you .
Are we sure about this ?
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have a lot of money on him .
I know that you &apos;re a teacher .
I &apos;m with my family right now .
Have you ever seen Tom &apos;s mother ?
They &apos;re very old friends .
I don &apos;t know why I just did that .
We can &apos;t go .
Can you stop it ?
He found it .
What does Tom want you to do ?
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I must know the truth .
Tom and Mary are my children .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do it again .
I know what I &apos;ll do .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t alone .
Tom looked at Mary and so did John .
Tom is happy here .
I won &apos;t be able to eat all that by myself .
Tom doesn &apos;t like living in Boston .
I was at home .
Tom is happy , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m tired already .
Why don &apos;t they like me ?
Do you want to go , too ?
These are very old books .
I believe you like your job .
Are you a student here ?
I knew that Tom was from Boston .
Don &apos;t say his name .
Tom knows we &apos;re coming .
The doctor gave it to her .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
Everyone seems to be busy but me .
Tom made some coffee .
Everyone &apos;s asleep .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
I like them .
How did you like it ?
I don &apos;t want to do that for Tom .
Tom tried to leave .
We know what to do .
You may not like this book .
This book is too difficult to read in a week .
May I show you something ?
That &apos;s a lot !
She came back an hour later .
I forget her name .
Come and see me .
You can do it .
He will not listen to me .
I am going to my room , where I can study .
I really don &apos;t have much time .
We don &apos;t talk much .
Tom isn &apos;t coming .
I need a lot of books .
I got sick last week .
You came too late .
She wasn &apos;t able to talk to him .
I did everything for you .
We know why you did it .
He &apos;s good .
Did you really say that ?
I &apos;m on my way to work now .
Where are Tom and Mary ?
We &apos;ll be home soon .
May I see my girlfriend now ?
Don &apos;t play here .
How long &apos;ll that take ?
Tom kept me waiting for three hours .
What do we tell Tom ?
Tom asked a question .
He asked her to read it for him .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
We saw everything .
We &apos;ll come with you .
I was alone .
I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t understand .
How far away is your school ?
I &apos;m game .
Tom told me that he was very tired .
What would you say if you were in my place ?
Tom is a very good man .
Did you enjoy reading that book ?
What I have to tell you is very important .
The story cannot be true .
Who am I ?
I need to speak with you right away .
I wish it was that easy .
I &apos;ll go myself if I need to .
Tom knows what Mary said .
I can &apos;t believe I just said that .
They have what they want .
I want to go home .
What does he say ?
Tom &apos;s shoes are too big for him .
Tom often goes to Boston to visit his family .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
I know Tom likes Mary .
Give Tom the money .
Tom is not going to do it .
Tom can write well .
That &apos;s not a good idea .
Is Tom a good person ?
Could you come to my office when you have a moment ?
We &apos;ll get it .
I &apos;m going to wait here for you .
I have friends .
Tom is playing with his cat .
Tom has nothing .
Tom wanted that .
I still think about her from time to time .
He is as old as my father .
I wasn &apos;t home .
All you have to do is tell Tom to leave .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom yourself ?
I already told Tom .
Why are you so tired ?
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
I don &apos;t want to live alone .
I don &apos;t have time to help you right now .
He had no money .
I &apos;ll be there on Monday .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was that old .
I didn &apos;t ask you to help me .
Tom just might get better .
I like to go to school .
We &apos;re just here to help .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed .
I think about Tom every day .
Tom didn &apos;t come home last night .
Tom probably won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
I think you know what I want .
That makes me happy .
What I &apos;m about to say will answer your question .
I am through with my work .
He &apos;s not sick .
I &apos;m not going to drink this .
I &apos;ll do what I need to do .
Why &apos;s Tom going to Boston ?
I want you with me .
Tom asked Mary how much money she had .
I &apos;ll never ever do that again .
We were in Boston .
I &apos;m a good boy .
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
We don &apos;t have a problem .
I saw this coming .
I need to talk to you about what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow .
We know that Tom is here .
There are just two of us .
We &apos;ll stay here .
Who do you think I am ?
I &apos;ve never been better .
I &apos;m more than happy .
There &apos;s someone else I want to see .
I can &apos;t tell what it is .
We don &apos;t want to do that .
That &apos;ll be good .
I don &apos;t know where that is .
They soon became friends .
He is a good student .
Have we met before ?
What would you like to do tomorrow ?
This is a mistake .
I think that &apos;s where Tom is now .
I &apos;ll go back to Boston .
Come home at six .
You can tell me the truth .
We meet once a month .
Tom got that from Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait that long .
I &apos;m important .
We won &apos;t be here much longer .
We need something to eat .
What else can I do for you ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I forgot what I was going to say .
I expect Tom will know what to do .
That &apos;s mine , too .
Tom was asked not to do that again .
I went to bed early because I was tired .
Can I speak to the doctor ?
Tom had nothing to eat .
Tom looks tired .
If you don &apos;t believe me , ask Tom .
I &apos;m not sure if I can do that .
He sat on the bed .
Maybe your name really is Tom .
I want you to leave now .
My father bought this hat for me .
Tom told me that he needed some money .
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle .
What can you tell me about that ?
There is a book on the table .
Tom is looking at Mary .
I didn &apos;t want anything .
Why do I always have to do that ?
Who &apos;s working tonight ?
You got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
There is much more to be done .
The story about Tom eating my cat isn &apos;t true .
They &apos;ll never find you here .
I want the money .
Tom has to stay in Australia for one more week .
I know it &apos;s Tom .
Tom can &apos;t read .
Where do you get your hair done ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is in Boston .
Tom wanted to live .
He &apos;s my brother .
Let me do it .
I said I &apos;d go .
Would you like to have some tea ?
I have to take it .
Tom is very good at French .
We have to get at the truth of the matter .
I gave one to Tom , too .
I don &apos;t understand what the problem is .
We had so much fun together .
Tom stopped talking .
Tom , what are you doing here ?
Tom came to see Mary .
I don &apos;t know who did it .
You &apos;re so beautiful !
Why aren &apos;t they here ?
They saw Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t doing so well .
It would be fun .
I feel sorry for the children .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
I remember it very well .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will think .
Do you want me to go now ?
I saw her yesterday .
I know what Tom would say .
I will be back soon .
I don &apos;t know what they want .
I can sing .
Tom , is that you ?
He &apos;ll be back soon .
I think I &apos;ve heard enough .
We can &apos;t go back .
You &apos;ve found it .
Does he have money ?
We &apos;re going to be here all day .
All those things are true .
Why don &apos;t we talk about this now ?
Tom still does that as often as possible .
I really should be getting to bed .
I always have something to do .
Tom seemed better .
We were all tired .
I don &apos;t understand this .
I must buy one .
My brother &apos;s name is Tom .
This makes me happy .
We &apos;ll stand .
A man must work .
Tom will drive .
What do I have ?
All you had to do was ask .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom now lives in Boston .
Is that not enough ?
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t know if I can do this without you .
Tom wants to make Mary happy .
She may have known the answer .
I &apos;m not finished .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
We &apos;ll be in Boston all week .
Don &apos;t give Tom what he wants .
Tom has no money .
Do you have children already ?
It isn &apos;t going to be easy .
Can he speak French ?
I wrote it for Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t worried .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
How &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
Tom is old enough to drink .
Who else is there with you ?
I have met her before .
Do you have a picture ?
That &apos;s not where I want to go .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave his dog with me .
Why can &apos;t he play tennis today ?
What do we know about Tom ?
Tom started to sing .
Why did I do that ?
The book is on the table .
Tom &apos;s parents are John and Mary .
Why don &apos;t you go to Boston ?
They say it &apos;s very good .
I &apos;ll stop by later .
How is your mother ?
I can hardly understand what he says .
How long have you been a doctor here ?
All of them swim very fast .
I asked him his name .
I &apos;m surprised you came at all .
It could have been me .
Your French is good enough .
Tom and I are getting married .
No one wants to talk about books anymore .
I &apos;ll ask him if he will come .
You know how important you are to me .
She is still a girl .
We see each other every day .
I &apos;m very happy here .
I think they saw you .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s even possible .
Tom died at the hospital .
I &apos;m very rich .
Why isn &apos;t Tom coming ?
Tom looked away .
I can &apos;t take my eyes off her .
I &apos;ve got no money left .
I don &apos;t know if he would have done it for me .
They may be playing in the park .
I know what I know .
He hardly ever works .
That &apos;s the way .
I know how old Tom is .
What kind of food do you like to eat ?
Tom didn &apos;t have enough time to finish his homework .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
Do you want my help or not ?
Tom had money , a lot of it .
Did Tom speak French ?
I can &apos;t live without her .
You must help her .
How do I do this ?
I want a room for tonight .
Tom was there .
I &apos;m at school .
Tom looked into the room .
We have our lives to live .
I don &apos;t like you , Tom .
Tom said he would come to the party .
Have you finished your homework ?
I think you &apos;re going to like it .
Do you have anything to read ?
I wish I had seen her .
Tom has just finished eating dinner .
Could you please tell me why ?
Tom went out .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary right now .
That didn &apos;t use to happen .
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the office .
We do want that , don &apos;t we ?
I met Tom in the park .
I just want to go home .
Tom is with him .
Tom was very happy .
I know what they are .
Tom said Mary may do that .
What &apos;s this got to do with Tom ?
If you &apos;re happy , I &apos;m happy .
I think these are yours .
I will have to study tomorrow .
Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
Come with me now .
Tom seems to be very happy to be here .
Tom probably has a girlfriend already .
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young .
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle ?
You &apos;re not my brother .
Who lives in that house ?
I &apos;ll take Tom home .
I will never have a daughter .
Can I go to work ?
How do you like your new car ?
You &apos;re pretty good at that .
That &apos;s easy for you to say .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
Are you happy or not ?
What if Tom doesn &apos;t do that ?
I don &apos;t know where you work .
What did you say ?
Don &apos;t let him listen to this music .
He &apos;ll understand .
I met Tom .
How well do you sing ?
Tom is often late for work .
Her family is very large .
Tom has a friend in Boston .
I don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
Tell me it &apos;s not true .
I want you to leave my house .
Tom didn &apos;t go home yesterday .
How do you think Tom does it ?
I &apos;m nothing like you .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
It &apos;s you that she loves , not me .
Do you really want to help ?
I don &apos;t like this weather .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Is that really Tom &apos;s sister ?
Do you really want to talk about that now ?
I love her so much that I can &apos;t leave her .
Tom was in bed all morning .
I am a boy .
I know that you don &apos;t like me .
You &apos;ve often said so yourself .
Are we ready ?
Tom looked very tired when he got home .
Tom comes to school by car .
It &apos;s too difficult .
Tom knows where you are .
What &apos;s for dinner ?
I know that you know .
It &apos;s great to see you &apos;re having so much fun .
This isn &apos;t for Tom .
Tom had no idea who Mary &apos;s father was .
This is what you have to do .
Do you have any more questions ?
What you did was wrong .
What does Tom have on ?
Let me go alone .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to us .
Tom did his homework and then went to bed .
Tom started talking to himself .
Do you have a brother ?
I &apos;ve been alone for a long time .
Tom is the one with the problem .
Do you want that ?
Tom wanted to meet Mary .
I can &apos;t remember any of it .
You must work .
What &apos;s the time now ?
I &apos;m coming for you , Tom .
You gave Tom the money he asked for , didn &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t do it now .
Do you want to read ?
I knew I forgot something .
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
I have to go back to the office .
This was too much for Tom .
When do you think Tom is going to do that ?
Tom isn &apos;t at home now .
I just couldn &apos;t do it .
What kind of person is Tom ?
I &apos;m from Australia .
What are they doing out here ?
What kind of game is this ?
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t do that .
I &apos;ll get ready .
What does Tom &apos;s new car look like ?
Do you know this ?
Tom isn &apos;t my friend .
It &apos;s possible .
Tom told me he was going to talk to Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t get very far .
I feel happy .
I was very busy .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand .
What time is it by your watch ?
Where did Tom see you ?
Why do people do things like that ?
Tom didn &apos;t try to do anything .
Do you want to know who did this ?
Tom will be surprised .
How often do you eat out ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any children .
I asked Tom to sing .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
How can it be ?
She is free from care .
I want Tom to live .
She loves Tom , not me .
Is this what I think it is ?
Tom lives in Boston , too .
She has a picture .
Tom won &apos;t be back tomorrow .
You had better not read this book .
When does Tom want to do this ?
Tom is doing that the right way , isn &apos;t he ?
Where do they live ?
There &apos;s only one window in my room .
That &apos;s not yours .
Tom told me you were with my son when he died .
What can you tell me about Tom ?
We meet here once a month .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;ll do .
I know you have a girlfriend .
I didn &apos;t finish reading that book .
I think Tom wants something to eat .
It looks like Tom got what he wanted .
Do you want to do this ?
Tom told you something , didn &apos;t he ?
I forgot to give you what Tom gave me to give you .
Tom has one for you .
Tom knows some French .
Tom will be able to swim soon .
Have you told Tom &apos;s mother ?
Tom wrote a letter .
You didn &apos;t tell me that Tom speaks French .
He is the last man to do such a thing .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t together anymore .
He must be very happy .
The door is open .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
What do you do here , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know any better .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary ever again .
Maybe Tom is sick .
You speak French very well .
What more could you want ?
I think Tom did well .
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;ll have to go home now .
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
It wasn &apos;t an accident .
Do you want Tom to do that for you ?
I only need two of these .
Tom is doing everything he can .
They are in the way .
Tom said he &apos;d be here .
I have finished .
I just want to be alone .
I wonder if Tom has a girlfriend .
I am going to see him today .
Would you like to eat something else ?
Tom is the only person who knows about this .
Tom and Mary are very old friends .
The man who came to visit you didn &apos;t say who he was .
Tom is afraid of making mistakes .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
What &apos;s your wife &apos;s name ?
I want nothing to do with it .
What does Tom really want ?
&quot; Where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I can &apos;t find him . &quot;
He loves me for who I am .
What did Tom say about me ?
You shouldn &apos;t go .
This isn &apos;t about me .
Do you want me to do that for you ?
This is sick .
He likes me and I like him too .
They understand us .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom never does that by himself .
I did what you told me to do .
This is my dog .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s dog &apos;s name .
What else did you two do ?
Tom said something in French .
Tom arrived at the hotel .
Why don &apos;t I do that ?
Tom can swim very fast .
You made too many mistakes .
I want to tell you one thing more .
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
Can I talk to Tom , please ?
You know I don &apos;t have a car .
You must read this book .
Do you know who said that ?
Tom wants to go with us .
Tom got into bed .
Tom is going to make mistakes .
Do you even know where the school is ?
If you don &apos;t want to stay , you don &apos;t have to .
Let me help .
He doesn &apos;t care a bit about me .
I &apos;m happy for all of you .
He must be tired .
Please wait here .
What would you like to have ?
Tom wants to take you home .
This isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
No one was watching .
Tom is still in the hospital .
Come if you can .
Tom will be happy to show you the way .
You look fine , Tom .
Tom wanted to meet you .
I don &apos;t get what you mean .
He wanted to come with us .
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
That can &apos;t be true .
Tom is cold .
I do my homework after school .
I want you , Tom .
Tom had no reason not to do it .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that for Mary .
Tom wanted to get married to Mary .
Who told you that ?
Do you know where you are , Tom ?
Tom already knew what to do .
What are you doing home ?
He loves her . She loves him , too .
I have no money today .
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
Tom may come .
We only do what we &apos;ve been told .
If I have time , I &apos;ll do it .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here with us ?
Tom did that just a month ago .
It was almost too easy .
I had a good opinion of her .
When was the last time you went to Boston ?
This is very good .
He doesn &apos;t need to work .
This is a picture of Tom and me when we were three years old .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be able to find it .
I &apos;m not as rich as I &apos;d like to be .
I &apos;ve been thinking of you all day .
Tom wants to see you .
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up .
What are you doing out there ?
I want to show Tom around town .
Tom knows what we need .
Are you Tom &apos;s brother ?
I went to her house , but she was not at home .
She thought for a few minutes .
I &apos;m getting old .
What do you see ?
I &apos;m going home now .
It &apos;s ready .
Can Tom help us ?
I don &apos;t want to be in your way .
I am thinking about my children .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom is now .
We know all about you .
This room is not very large .
She loves Tom .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell Mary the truth ?
I think about you all the time .
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
They were ready .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing .
Tom &apos;s happy .
Tom asked Mary a question .
It was not always this way .
I didn &apos;t ask Tom to wait for me .
I asked him what his name was .
We have no money .
No one is coming .
What &apos;s Tom doing in Boston ?
Why not look into the matter yourself ?
I know a little French .
You never seem to get sick .
Tom made this for me .
I gave him the book .
That &apos;s what you think .
I &apos;m not going .
They have lived here for ten years .
Let &apos;s live here .
What am I going to do with you ?
What &apos;s your take on this ?
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
Let &apos;s eat our food before it gets cold .
I want some of those .
I want you to know that .
What are the two of you doing ?
Please don &apos;t get up .
I met Tom tonight .
We &apos;re out of time .
Tom would like to see you .
My mother is making a cake .
What are people saying ?
Who &apos;s at the door ?
I know that Tom has been sick .
There will always be things we &apos;ll never understand .
Tom isn &apos;t talking to me .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
I &apos;m almost done here .
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
I &apos;ll never see him again .
Where did you learn to speak French ?
This is a picture of my family .
Everyone does what he wants .
You &apos;ll meet Tom .
You have to come .
Tom got up .
What am I going to do , Tom ?
There &apos;s got to be an answer .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Who &apos;ll come ?
They aren &apos;t all bad .
There were too many people there .
You should go see a doctor .
These are my shoes and those are yours .
I go to the park .
I will never forget the day when I first met him .
He &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
I know where that is .
It is too late .
I thought Tom might be sick .
Nobody wants him to come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom has told me a lot about you .
Tom looks lost .
I &apos;m going to show you something .
I don &apos;t want to hear a thing about it .
Tom didn &apos;t know where Mary was .
I don &apos;t need anything .
I &apos;m angry with Tom .
You need a new hat .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
We &apos;ll take you home .
Tom has seen it , too .
Did you read it at all ?
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
You should eat .
She must be sick .
Did you do your homework ?
I &apos;ve never done this before .
They &apos;re already here .
What is it like in Boston ?
They really did it .
It was very cold , but I went out .
I gave Tom that .
Tom walked home .
Tom knows us very well .
We &apos;re going to go .
Is he a doctor ?
Why don &apos;t you go home early today ?
Tom is going to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that .
I &apos;m not too tired .
Tom lives in Boston .
What &apos;s your son &apos;s name ?
I &apos;m going to see Mary this afternoon .
I just have one question for you .
The children are already tired .
This is not good .
Why do they want me ?
Tom can drive a car .
He seemed to have been rich .
How was the French class ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom yet .
You went to the park yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
Why do I have to be here ?
I want him to go there .
I believe in Tom .
I don &apos;t want to listen to you .
I don &apos;t like that woman .
We never forget .
You &apos;re my friend .
She has a lot of friends here .
Are you free now ?
I like going to Boston .
Tom is no longer here .
Who knows that ?
No one can tell .
He wants to see if he &apos;s still got what it takes .
I didn &apos;t know that she had a child .
I &apos;m not happy with it .
I have something to give you .
I have to find Tom .
Is there something that you want to tell me ?
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
She &apos;s a woman now .
I can &apos;t go to work today .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
You shouldn &apos;t drink that water .
I know what I said .
He came out of the room .
Tom wants me to be his girlfriend .
Tom may do that here .
What &apos;re you saying ?
How exactly can I help you ?
Tom was home alone at the time .
Does he have a dog ?
This isn &apos;t over .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew how to speak French ?
The days are getting longer .
I didn &apos;t know Tom knew how to do that .
He &apos;s coming .
Tom is a friend .
Tom can &apos;t find Mary .
I don &apos;t know what Tom did with it .
It happened again , didn &apos;t it ?
It is me that is wrong .
I don &apos;t want to go with Tom .
I &apos;ve already tried doing it that way .
What are we doing today ?
Are you good at French ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;ll be finished .
Tom needs to stay where he is .
I think Tom is thirty .
We aren &apos;t like that .
Tom seems sick .
Where will we eat ?
I know Tom .
Tom and Mary are fun to be around .
I can &apos;t do without your advice .
They all say that .
He lives in Boston .
He has already gone home .
It &apos;s been a long time since we last saw each other .
What &apos;s Tom going to say about this ?
I don &apos;t like your hat .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to Tom &apos;s ?
I don &apos;t have a car .
Tom will go with us tomorrow .
They &apos;re not there .
He took his time .
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
Tom likes Mary , you know ?
You &apos;re too late .
They &apos;re with me .
I &apos;m not your brother .
Did Tom do that ?
My father died when I was three .
Don &apos;t you want Tom there ?
Can I ask why this is so important to you ?
He is said to be rich .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
It must be Tom .
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
That &apos;s Tom .
If the car is gone , he can &apos;t be at the office .
Is this your car ?
I did want that to happen .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
Who found Tom ?
Tom must not like Mary very much .
I can &apos;t say .
I &apos;d do it .
Tom wanted to say more , but he couldn &apos;t .
I want to read it .
Can you believe what he said ?
Tom told me he felt cold .
She got angry .
Tom is not yet able to swim .
I knew you &apos;d want to be told .
When you can &apos;t do what you want , you do what you can .
You &apos;re sure taking your time .
Tom gave that to me .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary &apos;s father was .
You should &apos;ve come to the party .
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
When did you get home ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to stay at home .
What are you doing in Boston ?
How many did you get ?
Tom is going to be back here soon .
It was three years ago .
I had better ask her .
I &apos;ll be reading a book .
Who speaks French ?
I want to try to enjoy this .
We &apos;ve got to be ready in thirty minutes .
You &apos;re not going to sleep , are you ?
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
You &apos;d better get going .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
I have to go .
I already did that .
I can take the train .
Do you know how to do this ?
We &apos;d better go home now .
I &apos;ll do what I can .
Did Tom tell you why he wasn &apos;t at school yesterday ?
Do you want to do it right now ?
Tom said he &apos;s not going to do that .
He wants to talk to you .
Can you hear me , Tom ?
I &apos;ll be back in five minutes .
Is that what it takes ?
Tom is worried .
Why is everyone afraid of Tom ?
We &apos;re not home .
Do you want to come along with us ?
She wants him .
That we are not able to do .
Maybe I should just stay home .
You could &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
You don &apos;t need to be afraid .
I &apos;m not going to say that .
Can you show it to me ?
What did you do today ?
Why are you here , Tom ?
You must eat .
I &apos;m in Boston now .
We met last night .
Tom lives in Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t have to go .
She left the room .
I said go home .
I believe I was wrong .
Tom is a little over thirty .
He has been like a father to me .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I &apos;m coming .
Tom is my mother &apos;s brother .
How long will this take ?
You don &apos;t know how much I love you .
I saw you there .
What is the matter with your car ?
The police are here .
I think Tom is doing that , too .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to sleep on the bus .
I didn &apos;t study at all .
I already said I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Who &apos;d buy this ?
I don &apos;t know what you want .
They should ask Tom first .
We like Tom .
I made that .
Come back in a week .
Let &apos;s see what Tom has to say about Mary &apos;s plan .
He made me happy yesterday .
I think Tom was born in Australia .
I don &apos;t have a wife .
Tom knows nothing about Mary .
It &apos;s a matter of time .
I have never done this before .
What were they thinking ?
Tom wants to get married .
Don &apos;t come again .
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
What are you doing after work ?
Tom knows not to do that .
How did it happen ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have time right now to do that .
Don &apos;t say anything .
What &apos;re you doing with that ?
There &apos;s something I need to give you .
I know people .
I know you .
How are you two doing ?
I &apos;ve been here for hours .
I like this answer .
Tom is going to be here .
I like Australia .
This is Tom .
Maybe I should &apos;ve told Tom .
I knew Tom was going to do that .
That &apos;s a school .
I don &apos;t ever want to leave this room .
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t home .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at French .
Tom was alone there .
He looks like my father .
We didn &apos;t try .
I haven &apos;t seen her since last month .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
I put on my shoes .
We hardly ever agree on anything .
Who talked ?
Tom likes French and he &apos;s good at it .
What did you eat when you were in Australia ?
I think I understand .
I have to go to bed .
Why aren &apos;t you with your parents ?
I &apos;m sick .
Tom and Mary are both students .
Your French is hard to understand .
We have a new problem .
This can &apos;t be true .
Tom looked Mary in the eyes .
No one knew a thing .
We need to do a better job .
What does Tom know about me ?
I think I know what Tom is doing .
I still don &apos;t know .
Tom needs to do that every morning .
We &apos;re going to wait in the car .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom won &apos;t listen to me .
Tom and I want to go home .
I &apos;m glad of that .
Tom and Mary had a lot of fun .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t love you .
They &apos;re about to leave .
I &apos;d like for you to go .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
Are you sure you &apos;re not busy ?
He never saw his mother again .
I was told Tom would be here .
You could &apos;ve asked me .
He has a little money .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
I know everything I need to know .
Have Tom do it .
I saw Tom doing that yesterday .
Let &apos;s not study French today .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Your daughter isn &apos;t a girl anymore .
I haven &apos;t told Tom anything .
I don &apos;t have anything to give you .
I was so happy .
Tom wasn &apos;t even there .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
We had a lot of fun together today , didn &apos;t we ?
I think this book is very good .
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
What &apos;s with you ?
It &apos;s ten minutes to two .
Can you help me ?
I need to help Tom .
Your thirty minutes are almost up .
When will he be back ?
Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
I made this for you .
I just got here yesterday .
I don &apos;t think Tom is coming .
How does Tom get to school ?
Why do you think I &apos;m not happy ?
Tom is a very good student .
Tom can &apos;t sing .
No one &apos;s coming to our party tonight .
Tom doesn &apos;t love you as much as I love you .
I have no idea why it is so .
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
We &apos;ll get this one .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet whether he &apos;ll go or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to help you .
She loves Tom more than she loves me .
I can &apos;t hear anything at all .
You &apos;re going to like this .
I don &apos;t have many friends .
I like music very much .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Please say that once again in French .
You don &apos;t have to stay to the end .
That car is Tom &apos;s .
We often hear you sing .
Tom had three of them .
I made that for you .
I know his family .
He isn &apos;t alone anymore .
We must finish our homework first .
Tom came to see us yesterday afternoon .
What &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
I need someone to talk with .
I &apos;ll be back at ten .
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
Tom is not happy with this .
Can you see them ?
Everyone &apos;s watching .
Who made this cake ?
It &apos;s just a game .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to walk .
Tom is on his way to work .
Are you from Boston ?
I don &apos;t like being alone .
We should read as many books as possible .
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
How can that be ?
We &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
No one likes to do that .
I &apos;m ready .
I want what Tom has .
It is time to go .
I want a drink .
Your question does not have an answer .
Tom still has a lot to learn .
This could be a mistake .
We were right .
Tom said that I should leave .
How &apos;d you do it ?
I don &apos;t want to do this .
How many times an hour does Tom do that ?
Would you like to say anything ?
Tom wanted money .
How rich are they ?
I &apos;m going to the hospital .
What does Tom want to say to Mary ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about my family .
Tom and Mary have been here for three hours .
Can I see that one ?
I thought you &apos;d understand .
Can anyone tell me the time ?
Have they gone ?
She probably knows .
I wonder who that girl is .
Can we help ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Boston .
I don &apos;t want to study today .
It &apos;s been nice talking to you , but I really must go now .
Why do you have this ?
Don &apos;t show your face around here again .
We don &apos;t know what to do .
He has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
Do you know how Tom is doing ?
I &apos;ll go there on Monday , too .
I said that I would help him .
Tom seems afraid .
I &apos;ll be fine here .
This has nothing to do with you .
You know something , don &apos;t you ?
He is still young .
Why are you going ?
Tom is working on it now .
I was in Boston last week .
Have any of you seen Tom ?
Do you want to leave it like that ?
Maybe Tom is in the hospital .
If Tom goes , I &apos;ll go , too .
You &apos;ll do fine .
Tom asked me to give you this .
Give me your money !
I hope it &apos;s not too late .
She seems happy .
I want to be as happy as Tom .
Give those to Tom .
Tom never wanted to study French .
I found the book easy .
Tom is already here , but Mary isn &apos;t here yet .
Did you like that ?
I &apos;d like to see what Tom has .
I &apos;m not a child anymore .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for Tom .
Tom might never speak to me again .
I think I could help .
I bought a book yesterday .
She didn &apos;t have much money .
They &apos;re doing it now .
It had to be done .
Tom is our son .
Do you know what it is ?
I wish there was more I could &apos;ve done .
Tom isn &apos;t up yet .
We all like him .
Come here . I want to show you something .
I don &apos;t often come to Boston .
I don &apos;t understand English .
Tom &apos;s thirty .
You can help .
Tom is like me .
Tom did really well .
They &apos;re doing fine .
I was asked to wait here .
She &apos;s been in the hospital for a month .
He is a man of his word .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like your new job .
Tom , do you want to go with me ?
You know who I am .
This house is mine .
He gave it to me .
You don &apos;t seem to be very happy .
Tom has already done it .
Tom won &apos;t have to wait very long .
Mary came up to me when she saw me .
I think I &apos;m a good teacher .
What were you doing then ?
Tom works too much .
Tom wants to take it .
Tom didn &apos;t study French yesterday .
I want to have nothing to do with you .
It &apos;s not about money .
It &apos;s getting cold .
They won &apos;t help you .
We &apos;ll do that .
What did you do with Tom ?
Tom , I want to stay with you .
Tom should eat .
Could you bring me something to eat ?
I lost the watch that my father gave me .
We want to take it .
Tom seems like a good person .
I don &apos;t see what good that &apos;ll do .
There is no answer to your question .
Could you tell me the way to the station , please ?
I believe that it can be done .
What are you two doing out here ?
Tom knew what Mary knew .
Tom is your father .
He comes here every three days .
What don &apos;t we know ?
I know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
We &apos;re getting tired .
Tom doesn &apos;t want it , does he ?
He thought that I was very tired .
Tom is three years old .
Tom knows a lot of people .
I &apos;m quite busy .
Tom is after me .
We &apos;re getting better and better .
I don &apos;t like it here .
There &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
What do you want to give Tom ?
I know his name .
I had no idea Tom was a doctor .
I don &apos;t need this anymore .
Let &apos;s not talk about that now .
I think I can do it .
We &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
You know that .
He has been sick for a long time .
We &apos;ll drive .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
I don &apos;t like those people .
Tell Tom that I need to talk to him .
I can &apos;t see well .
He can &apos;t read .
This is not important .
We have a lot of work to do today .
I hope Tom likes me .
I was kind of surprised Tom said that .
They &apos;re going to do it for us .
I &apos;m very tired .
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home .
You have nothing to worry about .
I think you &apos;ll want to see this .
I don &apos;t know what you think .
How good are you ?
I am right .
I &apos;m not tired yet .
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
I think we &apos;d better wait a little longer .
Where are your people ?
Nobody wants Tom .
You &apos;re angry , aren &apos;t you ?
Can I see , too ?
He was the last to leave .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I think Tom and Mary are right .
Tom knows what it is .
You can &apos;t leave now .
Is Tom sick ?
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
Does Tom know how to drive ?
Are you here to see me ?
Tom lives in a very large house .
The only girl that will even talk to Tom is Mary .
We were too late .
Don &apos;t say such things .
I &apos;ll write a letter to Tom .
Why is Tom good at French ?
She is happy .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of your mother .
I want to stay for a few days .
Tom will soon be a father .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do it .
I don &apos;t know how long I &apos;ll be gone .
He isn &apos;t able to buy a car .
I bought Tom a new car .
Many of my friends can speak French .
Do you have the money ?
Tom arrived at the party after Mary did .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom who my father was .
Tom didn &apos;t want it .
I &apos;ll do what Tom says .
I had to study English .
Maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
It never happened .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
Can we please leave now ?
Let me see how I feel tomorrow .
Tom won &apos;t go away if you don &apos;t want him to .
I can &apos;t believe anything Tom says anymore .
I want you to do that with Tom .
I want to talk to you .
Why don &apos;t you want to go ?
Tom left the house .
What a nice idea !
Tom already knows what Mary has done .
We gave our word .
He gave me food and money as well .
I know who you are .
He doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
He wrote one letter .
I know Tom has gone to Boston .
That &apos;s quite possible .
Don &apos;t eat too much .
I can &apos;t swim at all .
I want to know what &apos;s going on .
Everyone likes Tom .
Do you know what this says ?
Can I have some of these ?
Tom speaks French better than me .
I love talking to you .
I want to be like Tom .
I think you look fine .
I don &apos;t have much money .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem ?
How was school today ?
Tom said his job was a lot of fun .
Do you know what it was ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of anything .
I just don &apos;t love Tom .
He &apos;s got enough money to buy a house .
I went to Tom &apos;s house after school .
Come again .
I &apos;d be happy to sing for you .
Nobody saw Tom do it .
Tom says that he was born in Boston .
Why aren &apos;t you in there ?
How did you come by the money ?
Tom is really busy .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have much money .
What should I have done ?
I can try it .
Are they still in bed ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know about it .
What do Tom and Mary do ?
I &apos;m very happy for Tom .
Everyone I know has been there .
Tom saw Mary with another man .
I made you coffee .
This is a picture of my car .
I think Tom might be in Boston right now .
English is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t want to believe you .
I wish I had more to give you .
Tom and Mary are talking to John .
Tom is in .
Tom usually goes to school by bus .
I must do it now .
That one &apos;s for me , too .
There are a lot of people here .
What &apos;re you watching ?
That &apos;s what people don &apos;t understand .
I have to go ask Tom .
Tom said that he would come .
That &apos;s not what I saw .
I can &apos;t stay here anymore .
I don &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
I &apos;d like a book .
I hope Tom comes .
We talk about it every day .
I &apos;ve known that for a long time .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been doing what he was doing .
I can &apos;t make out what she said .
Why was Tom in Boston ?
I don &apos;t have much time .
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
I can &apos;t believe I forgot .
I think it &apos;s time for me to do my homework .
Maybe that &apos;s the reason .
They are both good .
Tom can &apos;t see us .
I want to do that .
My father may be at home now .
It &apos;s difficult to help people that don &apos;t want your help .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything to eat ?
I love him , but he loves someone else .
Tom knows that .
I can &apos;t leave my family .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom in a long time .
I have to go talk to Tom .
He loves you very much .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Let &apos;s try something .
Tom lives with his family .
Come on , Tom . Let &apos;s go home .
It &apos;s a good school .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go .
It has been two years since he came to Japan .
I should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
I have to speak with you .
Get ready for school .
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine .
You can take your time .
We think you &apos;re doing very well here .
Maybe Tom gave it to Mary .
This is my bicycle .
I think Tom is afraid of you .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see that .
You should go home now .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him before .
I can &apos;t see a thing .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
I didn &apos;t know you could do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I want .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it here .
Let &apos;s not forget about what Tom said .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got much time .
Tom said very little .
Tom will be ready .
You &apos;re not the first person to say so .
What did you learn at school today ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
She should listen more to other people .
Tom will let you do that .
That &apos;s exactly what he wanted .
You must tell me .
I want to live in Boston .
I never would &apos;ve thought that I &apos;d meet you here .
We &apos;re not all like that .
Tom began to sing .
Tom may not be in Boston .
You don &apos;t have to do it .
He wants to be like me .
I am better .
I don &apos;t believe that anymore .
I want them all .
Why did you listen to them ?
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
I &apos;ll be at home .
Tom isn &apos;t going .
Tom said he had been busy .
We understand why .
I went to bed early .
Tom does nothing but play all day .
Can I go with you ?
I thought I had enough money .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
I don &apos;t quite know what to say .
Let &apos;s eat now .
I think he &apos;s too young .
Tom seems to have been rich .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
Tom likes to do everything himself .
Let &apos;s go get some food .
We &apos;re not doing that .
I think Tom is rich .
Tom is a good student .
It &apos;s difficult to help people who don &apos;t want your help .
This came for you .
Tom can play tennis quite well .
Tom knows his way around Boston .
Tell Tom what this is .
This really happened .
I love your son .
You never say anything .
I was just talking about you .
Stop doing that .
Why is Tom going to Boston ?
I &apos;ll get that .
You really don &apos;t know who that is , do you ?
Tom speaks too fast .
She is very busy .
I didn &apos;t tell him everything .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard that word in a long time .
Let &apos;s get this over with as fast as we can .
Did they ever find Tom ?
The weather is very bad .
How will I find it ?
Why do you want to go ?
Tom thinks he has found the answer .
Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
We &apos;re busy .
You can wait outside .
I &apos;d like a cup of coffee , please .
He doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
Tom is going to be sorry .
He has bought a new car .
Tom has been in Australia for three years .
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised that Mary was there .
Boston is a big city .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom .
Everyone &apos;s tired .
Tom works there .
Tom said he was too busy to help Mary do that .
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
Why did you go to his house ?
May I do that with Tom ?
Take care .
Nobody asked for your help .
We just got back from Boston .
The answer is right .
I &apos;ll take you home .
I &apos;ll ask Tom tomorrow .
What do you think of it ?
Who else is going to be at the party ?
Why do you think Tom said that ?
We don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary about John .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to know .
Why don &apos;t you go see Tom ?
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
I think it &apos;s time for me to say what I really think .
May I ask why ?
I &apos;ve heard this story before .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat out as often as they used to .
I don &apos;t know that girl &apos;s name .
How many people do you see ?
I want to buy a new car .
Tom talked .
How big is your school ?
I &apos;ll tell you when I get back .
I want to visit Boston again .
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was .
That looks good .
I was a little surprised .
Why &apos;s Tom looking at me ?
He could not swim .
I &apos;m really fast .
I &apos;ll find something .
How did you come up with such a good idea ?
Tom has never heard Mary sing .
What do you think has become of him ?
I want a lot .
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
I know what I &apos;m going to do .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
Tom wants to learn how to swim .
I wish I could talk about it .
It was too late .
Tom speaks good French .
You &apos;ll have to come with us .
Tom , are you there ?
I have already finished this book .
No one was there .
She &apos;s my wife .
They know everything .
There &apos;s nothing to do .
I don &apos;t know why we let you do that .
Do you have my money ?
Are you from Boston , too ?
It is a lot of fun to listen to music .
I like Tom &apos;s plan better than Mary &apos;s plan .
I wanted to buy the book .
They were fine .
What do you want me to do with Tom ?
When will he go home ?
Who &apos;s ready for more ?
I &apos;ll wait .
I tried to be like you .
That is what I want to know .
I don &apos;t want to talk about school .
We &apos;re coming .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s wife like ?
I don &apos;t feel well today .
Tom knows me .
Tom gave me that book .
Tom took one last look around the room before he left .
Why aren &apos;t you at school ?
They probably don &apos;t know .
I gave him a book .
Why did you go there ?
We &apos;re sorry about it .
I don &apos;t know what to say to Tom .
I think I &apos;ll take that one .
We &apos;re still working .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I &apos;d like to see you if possible .
She &apos;s in the hospital now .
Tom is not very good at French .
Nobody likes them .
That &apos;s a good thing .
We are coming .
She took her book .
That &apos;s what makes this so difficult .
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
Did you get something to eat ?
Where &apos;s my food ?
You know some French , don &apos;t you ?
Tom left ten minutes ago .
They lost their dog .
I still have friends in Boston .
It &apos;s up to us to do it .
We &apos;re not going .
I don &apos;t want you to be late .
Could you give me some advice ?
She &apos;s a dog .
Don &apos;t play in the street .
Tom knows French .
Tom might not be in Australia anymore .
I thought he wouldn &apos;t come .
She has a book .
It &apos;s not always like this .
I hit on a good idea .
I didn &apos;t get the job .
Do you know how many people are here ?
There &apos;s no food left .
It &apos;s not about the money , is it ?
That &apos;s not a good thing .
I don &apos;t know if I can do that or not .
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon .
We &apos;re not home right now .
The question is whether he can do it or not .
She didn &apos;t go yesterday .
Who &apos;s better at French , Tom or Mary ?
I found this book very difficult .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
Do we have one ?
My father was busy .
Have you told him yet ?
There &apos;s something under the bed .
This is probably Tom &apos;s bicycle .
Where are your friends going ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy , does he ?
Tom likes this .
Would you like some more tea ?
Tom says he loves it in Boston .
You won &apos;t need that .
Tom said he knew Mary .
What I did was wrong .
He didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
Do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
What are we doing here ?
I need to read a lot .
I met a friend .
We feel bad for them .
I am your friend , right ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever seen Tom do that .
Tom had a beer .
I was very tired .
Give us three minutes .
Maybe I can help .
Tom won &apos;t leave .
I can &apos;t remember your name .
I have seen it a lot .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
Don &apos;t worry about it .
Do you want to stop ?
Tom likes them .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston with me ?
Do you know why I &apos;m here ?
He took back everything he said .
Tom took the money .
I told you I didn &apos;t want any coffee .
Tom saw Mary do that .
I thought you said the police would never find us here .
I do feel pretty good .
What &apos;ll happen ?
I want to go to a hotel .
Is there anything that I can do to help you ?
Tom was the last to leave .
Tom won &apos;t stay .
The teacher has three times as many books as I do .
My sister is pretty .
I think we found it .
It seemed too good to be true .
I want to talk to you about something else .
May I go now ?
She got through her work before five .
I haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
I &apos;ll do that .
Tom has known Mary for close to ten years .
Do you want this or don &apos;t you ?
I want to read the book .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
Why should you want to do that ?
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
You know , don &apos;t you ?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow .
I made them myself .
All the money was gone .
I can &apos;t ever be what you were .
There &apos;s still one thing I don &apos;t understand .
I couldn &apos;t wait .
Tom &apos;s French is very good .
They don &apos;t like me .
I just want this to never happen again .
I told Tom what Mary did .
I have enough money to buy this book .
Who came ?
I saw that one coming .
Tom has children .
Tom knows where we are .
What do you want to do now ?
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Don &apos;t you know who I am ?
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
What is there to understand ?
Tom and Mary are right behind John .
I &apos;m an old woman .
Tom is looking at me .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t really like Mary very much .
I didn &apos;t even know that .
I need to ask you some questions .
I think he &apos;s happy .
Tom kept me waiting for more than 30 minutes .
Where did you go yesterday ?
You are a teacher .
We know it &apos;s not about that .
Let me show you the way .
She likes him .
This &apos;ll be fun .
I must go alone .
What are you going to see ?
We found it here .
You &apos;ll never forget it , I &apos;m pretty sure .
Mary looks like her mother .
I wish I had more money .
Tom can &apos;t have done it .
I &apos;m on the way home .
You know what Tom said , don &apos;t you ?
I will never make such a mistake again .
We want to talk to Tom .
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
There are some things that I don &apos;t understand .
I didn &apos;t tell them .
Tom still goes to school .
She will leave the hospital soon .
I can &apos;t leave until I find out who Tom is .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
They are very big .
It is good to see you .
This isn &apos;t about Tom .
We &apos;re ready , I think .
What does Tom want to do ?
Let me know what I can do to help .
Come see me again .
Tom saw Mary at school .
Is Boston very far away ?
I want to know what &apos;s out there .
I don &apos;t want dinner .
We always want what we can &apos;t have .
He kept us waiting for more than an hour .
I &apos;m going to do it for you .
She first met him in Boston .
You &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
I &apos;ve heard that .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom himself tried it .
Please just tell me what &apos;s going on .
I thought that I saw something .
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn &apos;t ready yet .
I need to talk with you about Tom .
I just found them .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
Tom was already doing that when I got here .
Maybe Tom knows something .
When are you going to talk to Tom about that ?
I had to work .
You aren &apos;t happy , are you ?
I don &apos;t want to hear this .
Tom made Mary very happy .
I couldn &apos;t hear Tom .
He found my bicycle .
The window is closed .
Tom loves us .
I wonder if Tom can come .
Where are you going to be ?
Tom is a friend from school .
Tom shouldn &apos;t wait for Mary for more than ten minutes .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
What was Tom &apos;s plan ?
How &apos;s the family ?
When do you eat dinner ?
I don &apos;t think this is for you .
Tom has already gone home .
Do you want to talk about it ?
He can read well .
I want to see Boston .
Tell me your plan .
I know you want to come home .
A lot has happened .
Come along with us .
I went to the station .
They &apos;re my books .
You don &apos;t look happy to see me .
I still haven &apos;t done it .
It was the only way .
I still haven &apos;t heard from him .
What does all this have to do with Tom ?
Tom and Mary are getting married next week .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
My parents don &apos;t know where I am .
I &apos;m not family .
You speak French very well . I wish I could speak it as well as you .
I was in Australia all last month .
Are you sure that you want to go there ?
I have a family .
That &apos;s another story .
Tom isn &apos;t busy .
I &apos;m almost sure .
Don &apos;t you want to come along ?
They &apos;re very happy .
This was all Tom &apos;s idea .
I &apos;m probably wrong .
He did not read the book .
Tom lost his job .
That &apos;s what Tom says .
I am ready to do anything for you .
I &apos;m going with Tom to Boston .
This first question is for you .
I asked my friend for advice .
What do they do there ?
Who said that ?
We need to speak with you .
We &apos;re here .
Please write it down .
No one can know everything .
We don &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t walk .
He can &apos;t help you .
I want the other one .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had seen us ?
It &apos;s not like that .
I want to be what you want me to be .
I would like to help you .
What are you going to do here ?
He had no money and so could not buy any food .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
There has to be another way to do this .
You should &apos;ve known better .
Just tell me what you know about the problem .
I feel good .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
My friend has arrived .
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
This is how I met your mother .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
She &apos;s a lot better today .
I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
I told them everything .
Tell Tom he should do that .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom .
We are with you .
I &apos;m late .
I want this phone .
Give me the book .
Give this book to Tom .
The boy bought a dog .
Tom only did that once .
Tom looks great .
That girl looks like Mary .
What did you tell Tom about it ?
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
Tom might know why Mary has to do that .
Tom has a lot of work to do .
He was kept waiting for a long time .
Tom knows where I am .
Tom really likes music a lot .
How are things with you and Tom ?
What &apos;s eating her ?
Tom is about to do that .
Tom and Mary are doing OK .
I know how we can help .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even speak to me .
I know Tom is old .
Tom knows the answer .
Tom may be out .
I was surprised Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
You made Tom very happy .
Can you drive me home ?
Why did you buy a car ?
I can swim fast .
I don &apos;t know if I can stay .
He was sick , but he went to school .
I hope that he will help me .
Tom has it .
They have been busy .
I don &apos;t have anything to say to Tom .
Tom already did that .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
I want you to be ready when Tom gets here .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
Tom seems to like talking about himself .
Tom is good at doing that , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom bought a table .
You &apos;re afraid of him .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for you .
I hope the bus will come before long .
I didn &apos;t want you to read that .
I didn &apos;t see Tom at all yesterday .
I didn &apos;t know you could do this .
Tom is coming to my house tonight .
Tom knows who we are .
I would like to go to sleep now .
Tom goes to school five days a week .
Tom is much better at French than me .
I see a house .
What am I going to do ?
You made it happen .
Your question has no answer .
She knows . She always knows .
I need Tom &apos;s money .
She gave him the money .
Tom has more than enough money to buy a car .
What &apos;s the weather like in Boston ?
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
I don &apos;t need a reason .
He really needs your help .
How did you make it ?
He seems to be rich .
I know Tom loves me .
I am surprised to learn this .
He left his wife .
That &apos;s not up to you .
Nobody loves me .
He told me everything .
I have a wife .
He &apos;s ready to go .
&quot; What did you say ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say anything . &quot;
We &apos;ve been through this before .
Tom saw someone .
I don &apos;t want to get into the water .
Where is the bus ?
Do you know where Tom is now ?
I have already finished reading this book .
Tom would like to know the reason .
What &apos;s wrong with you two ?
We &apos;re going to see Tom .
How was Boston ?
They &apos;re children .
I &apos;m out here .
Maybe he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
They can &apos;t see me .
It was Tom &apos;s idea to try it this way .
How do you plan to help ?
When did you buy it ?
This is all on me .
I &apos;m for that .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
I have to do something .
Tom said he &apos;s going to do that .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mother .
What &apos;s the time ?
That was really bad .
Why is he doing this ?
The children are gone .
He wants more .
Tom is going .
This is our house .
Tom saw it .
He doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
He gave him a book .
I won &apos;t forget it .
He knows how to make his wife happy .
Tom wasn &apos;t like that .
I just don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s happened .
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
He will be a good teacher .
We need to know whether it &apos;s true or not .
You had better not drive a car .
She can &apos;t live without him .
What do I need to do ?
I didn &apos;t have to tell Tom . He already knew .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that .
If you ever need a job , go see Tom .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
There &apos;s one more thing you need to do .
I came at about six .
Tom and Mary have finished their work .
This is the only thing I care about .
If you were in my place , what would you do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is happy .
What has he done to you ?
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
I went to school yesterday .
We have two children .
What did Tom do wrong ?
They &apos;ve never met .
We can &apos;t go back to Boston .
Tom knew a lot .
Tom needs our help .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s on Monday .
My mother loves music .
You may go at once .
I want that to happen .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m too tired to help him .
Tom now knows what he has to do .
You know what needs to be done .
When you &apos;re a father , you &apos;ll understand .
That &apos;s up to Tom , not me .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was that old .
Tom has enough money to buy it .
Tom tried to swim .
He can &apos;t stay long .
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom does .
I have never been to Boston .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
I didn &apos;t hear it .
I can &apos;t live on my own .
It would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had been here .
We want to talk to you about that .
You should have nothing to do with him .
Where &apos;s it from ?
What &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Tom should &apos;ve done it that way .
We &apos;re here to have fun .
I want to read this book .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed home .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
I know that Tom knows .
Where were you ?
When was the last time you saw Tom at school ?
I tried to tell you .
Tom needs your help .
I know what Tom is like .
Did you buy anything to eat ?
Tom isn &apos;t going with you , is he ?
I have no idea of what to do .
I don &apos;t have to say anything to Tom .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
I &apos;m worried about the baby .
Do you want to talk ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing this ?
What makes people happy ?
Tom is still in Australia .
Is this dog Tom &apos;s ?
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
How far is it from here to Boston ?
That &apos;s no good , Tom .
I don &apos;t remember what happened .
How could I help you ?
Have you read it ?
I hope we don &apos;t have to wait for too long .
Why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
Tom is nothing but a child .
What do they want from us ?
She never told me .
I &apos;m late , aren &apos;t I ?
It &apos;s a good thing .
We almost never eat out .
Tom has a plan .
Why do you want to be alone all the time ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s really going on .
He used to say so , but now he doesn &apos;t .
Tom &apos;s so old .
Tom has left .
I wrote this book .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Tom works alone .
I don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
Come along with me .
Why does Tom do things like that ?
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know why Mary wants to do that .
I really don &apos;t know Tom that well .
My children don &apos;t speak French .
That &apos;s good news .
It &apos;s a big world .
She is said to have been beautiful .
They want more .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s true or not .
I can speak to Tom .
I don &apos;t know what I have .
What do you know about what happened ?
You are very beautiful .
What does Tom have to say ?
Tom didn &apos;t answer the phone .
I don &apos;t want to know about this .
He bought himself a dog .
You &apos;d better stay in bed for a few days .
He can speak only a little English .
How &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
You don &apos;t need that .
It is pretty cold .
Who did this ?
He didn &apos;t say anything .
He will be back soon .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
I plan to go back to Boston as soon as I can .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off of Mary .
We have to do this right away .
Tom is pretty much finished .
I had nothing to do with her .
Tom seems as busy as ever .
Tom and Mary will keep their promise .
I &apos;m going to learn French .
I know what they said .
I know Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
Tom bought Mary a car .
He left the room .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom all week .
I forgot that Tom didn &apos;t speak French .
It is very cold today , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
Can you meet him ?
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come .
This is all I can do .
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog .
Tom can &apos;t help me anymore .
No one knew why .
You know this is what I want .
I like being a teacher .
I know what I want to do .
I really want to go .
I didn &apos;t let them know .
I &apos;ve got no time for that now .
Tom came to visit Mary .
That isn &apos;t Tom .
That &apos;s not very good , is it ?
Nobody can help me .
Please tell me this isn &apos;t true .
They &apos;re taking too long .
We have to leave in five minutes .
Tom was always there for me .
I can &apos;t find my watch .
It &apos;s very cold here .
I like your hair .
Did you get a beer ?
That &apos;s exactly what I want .
Where are you ?
I had no idea what I should write .
Tom isn &apos;t like people say he is .
We &apos;re busy , Tom .
Tom seems ready .
I still have so much to do .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten yet .
Tom is too young to drink beer .
Do you want to live in Boston ?
This isn &apos;t the first time .
You can go if you want to .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it here .
Can you stay for dinner ?
I wish she had come last night .
Tom is going home .
I don &apos;t want to stop .
That &apos;s where I want to be .
He has enough money .
He thought I was my brother .
Please say something .
My mother is at home .
Everyone likes them .
That &apos;s true too , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t have a family yet .
She &apos;s much better today .
I wonder if Tom is still outside .
I don &apos;t like you .
How did you get the job ?
Tom had nothing to do .
I need help .
What did you do this morning ?
What we need is help .
Come back tomorrow .
Can he do this job ?
What &apos;re you going to do with Tom ?
That &apos;s not true at all .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
Tom told Mary that he would do that .
How did she tell them ?
I want to drink some water .
Please wait for five minutes .
Tom and Mary want us to do that .
How did Tom get to be so rich ?
Tom went back to Boston yesterday .
This question is not easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened because he wasn &apos;t there .
Who is this woman ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Tom should &apos;ve done it the way you told him to do it .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
Tom said it was too cold .
That &apos;s the way we like it .
Tom hardly speaks any French .
This is not quite enough .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
He has already finished his work .
I came here yesterday .
You have made many mistakes .
I &apos;m not sure why they do that .
Why don &apos;t you come along with us to the party ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever been this busy .
I &apos;ll be late to work .
This book will do .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary anything about that .
Tom , you &apos;ll be here for me if I need you , won &apos;t you ?
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about it .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
I don &apos;t need a doctor .
Tom can speak French .
His mother and sister were sick .
You &apos;re going to have to do that .
Tom is in Australia .
Thank you for not saying anything .
I don &apos;t think that Tom can hear Mary .
I won &apos;t forget this .
Tom hasn &apos;t been living here long .
Tom thought that was a good idea .
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
I didn &apos;t know Mary was Tom &apos;s sister .
Why are Tom and Mary here ?
I was just looking out the window .
I &apos;m doing well .
Tom said he was very tired .
He had to stay in bed .
We have things to do .
Are these books yours or mine ?
Could you bring me some water ?
I asked where Tom was .
Why do you need to read such a book ?
Where did you see that woman ?
Tom is almost never late .
Tom will never believe me again .
They don &apos;t know yet .
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
Tom is as old as my father .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play outside .
We &apos;ll stop here for today .
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
I &apos;m here with my family .
I have everything I want .
He looks much better now .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew French ?
I didn &apos;t want to spend any more time in bed .
Tom asked me to help him with his homework .
You &apos;ve done a very good job .
What is he saying ?
I must find work .
Can your wife speak French ?
I know Tom is your friend .
Tom wants to be like me .
She needs you .
This is my father .
You know how it is .
I would like you to go home with me .
She tried to swim .
I have no idea where we are .
He doesn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
I know what that is .
I know your brother very well .
When did they leave ?
I am not the person I used to be .
Can you drive a car ?
Tom has a lot of work to do this week .
I have a lot of work to do .
He asked her some questions .
I &apos;m going to bed .
I &apos;m not going to go .
Tom isn &apos;t like me .
I was away for a year .
I &apos;m sorry about that .
Give Tom what he needs .
It makes me sick .
What made Tom do that ?
It looks like I got here too early .
These are my parents .
I &apos;m not that old .
Why do we have to do this ?
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
Do you want to do that again ?
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
I don &apos;t know her .
I made a big mistake .
Tom is still angry .
Everyone &apos;s saying it .
We &apos;ve got to do that on Monday .
I want to do this for Tom .
What do you want with me ?
I have two children .
Tom and Mary are with John .
May I go to bed ?
I &apos;ve known that a long time .
It &apos;s night .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything to me about that .
We &apos;re both fine .
I have a few friends here .
He didn &apos;t know that .
That can &apos;t be it .
Do you know what happened ?
That boy is his brother .
Where &apos;s Tom going with Mary ?
What do you want me to do ?
Is that my hat ?
Tom , could I have a word with you ?
I don &apos;t like English .
That was easy .
How &apos;re we doing ?
I thought you had already eaten .
Where does Tom want to live ?
The only time Tom seems to be happy is when he &apos;s with Mary .
Tom needs the money .
When is Tom coming home ?
This is what I &apos;ve always wanted to do .
He wants to learn to swim .
I can &apos;t find a thing .
What do you think &apos;s out there ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a car .
That is a very good question .
You know why I left .
I think they &apos;ll understand .
I know nothing about him .
I don &apos;t want to eat anything .
I &apos;ll look it up .
Tom knows I like him .
I was hardly able to see it .
The movie was good .
Can you play tennis ?
Don &apos;t be too long .
I wasn &apos;t a bit tired .
My work is almost finished .
If I can do it , so can you .
We &apos;re going to Boston .
That &apos;s mine .
There isn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Tom is alone in the house .
It &apos;s not a good idea .
We help Tom .
You look busy .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can do that or not .
Tom may have said that .
They &apos;re tired .
I know Tom would love to see you .
We &apos;ll see you there .
I have something else for you .
What have you eaten ?
She lives alone in this room .
I won &apos;t be home for a week .
This car &apos;s mine .
Have you seen this ?
No one &apos;s in there .
What would Tom say about this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is busy or not .
Tom , this is Mary &apos;s brother John .
I &apos;d like to stay a little bit longer .
I &apos;ll get back to you on this .
Tom went away .
Tom isn &apos;t the problem .
I have an idea what it is .
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
Tom was surprised by Mary .
We can talk about this later .
Is there anything for me ?
He &apos;s not one of us .
I &apos;m not going to go there again .
I &apos;ve got to speak to Tom .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
Tom has to go with Mary .
When did you first meet Tom ?
I saw her a week ago .
Tom didn &apos;t do it .
They have lived in this town for ten years .
She goes to school by bus .
Tom didn &apos;t get up before six .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tonight .
There is only one bus every two hours .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
Tom and I &apos;ll do that .
I want to go to the city .
I heard you say that this morning .
Did you get her letter ?
I only wish Tom had tried .
I &apos;ll be with Tom .
We &apos;re very busy just now .
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
What a country !
We had fun with them .
Do you want to study French ?
What have you done ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
I know that all of this is just a game .
I don &apos;t know exactly where .
Tell Tom why you didn &apos;t do that .
Why is it a good thing ?
I looked at my dog .
How long has it been since we last met ?
Do you have a moment ?
I want you to drive to Boston .
What do you think of these people ?
I think that &apos;s a good idea .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do so .
I enjoy your company .
I still can &apos;t believe it !
You &apos;re not rich , are you ?
He has money , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom wasn &apos;t done .
English is not difficult to learn .
What a good idea !
Tom doesn &apos;t want anything to drink .
I looked at Tom .
She had no brother .
Tom could read when he was three .
I &apos;m probably going to be busy soon .
Do you want me to leave ?
She got up late .
What do you learn English for ?
You should sleep .
He gave her a book .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to have anything to do with me .
The whole world speaks English .
Tom came here by bicycle .
It &apos;s much better now .
Tom will go to Boston next month .
How can you not like this ?
They had fun with us .
I don &apos;t really want to live in Boston .
What do you mean by it ?
How did you see that ?
I &apos;ve seen the picture before .
Can you come to the party ?
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
I told you I don &apos;t want your help .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will say .
He did as I told him .
Tom is probably at home .
You don &apos;t need to go there .
Have you finished what you were doing ?
We are here .
You did that really well .
You should probably tell Tom what to do .
It &apos;s happened .
Tom will leave soon .
Tom didn &apos;t need to wait very long .
I am to meet him there .
They &apos;re more than friends .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
I don &apos;t need your help .
They don &apos;t know about it .
He has no children .
There &apos;s no one here .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
Tom is the one with a car .
She was very busy .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom that myself .
Where are they living ?
I have one brother .
Tom almost never goes to Boston .
How far is it to the station ?
Tom is better today than yesterday .
I know you like Tom .
He may come today .
I know where we are .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re alone .
You can do this , can &apos;t you ?
We can &apos;t leave Boston until we finish this job .
Tom will be here today .
This tea is very good .
I don &apos;t know why I did that .
You are not able to swim , are you ?
Tom is like his father .
Tom lost .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
Tom &apos;s new girlfriend is very young .
You have to stop it .
Tom is with us .
They live in another country .
Tom wants to come with us .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
You &apos;re just doing your job .
Tell me what you know .
I was a teacher .
Tom and Mary never do anything together anymore .
How long have you been here ?
I am not coming today .
Who &apos;s the girl in this picture ?
I have to go to Boston with Tom .
Tom wants you to have it .
I think Tom will be able to help .
I don &apos;t know whether to go to the party or not .
What was the weather like yesterday ?
I am afraid I can &apos;t help you .
I &apos;ve said I &apos;m sorry .
I saw the doctor .
I don &apos;t know why everyone &apos;s so tired .
Did Tom just leave ?
I &apos;m already rich .
Tom wants a new hat .
We have nothing else to eat .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want my help .
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
Tom looks like he &apos;s happy .
You can have as many as you want .
Tom can &apos;t see Mary from where he is .
Why is Tom going ?
We didn &apos;t do it for Tom .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
It would be better for you to stay in bed today .
When is Tom going to do that ?
We want to talk to you about a problem .
That &apos;s very good news .
There &apos;s something I need to talk with you about .
He has nothing to do .
Are all of them your friends ?
I &apos;m able to swim .
What are you still doing here ?
I left my wife .
That &apos;s what Tom likes to do .
Everyone knows about Tom .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I know Tom well .
You &apos;re very rich , aren &apos;t you ?
They &apos;re not happy .
You should go to bed early .
Is he Tom ?
What do Tom and Mary look like ?
I don &apos;t need a lot of money .
Tom isn &apos;t himself today .
When are you going to come ?
I think that I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
Tom isn &apos;t happy .
What time is it now by your watch ?
Tom wants a new car .
He knows no English .
I wonder if I &apos;ll ever get married .
I should go now .
Can I talk to you ?
I &apos;ll get in touch with you next week .
Thank you for the tea .
What do you want to do today ?
I was just about to go home .
Tom says he &apos;s not going .
Tom and I &apos;ll go to Boston .
She stopped talking .
It &apos;s no big thing .
What do you think these are ?
We &apos;ve got something for you .
I saw her for the last time .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t need to do that .
Tom wrote that book .
Who has it ?
I don &apos;t want to do this with you .
Tom wanted to learn how to read .
He can &apos;t drive .
I can understand why you don &apos;t want to eat there .
I &apos;ll meet you there in one hour .
Where is your friend ?
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
I know Tom was right .
What does Tom have ?
How did you get into the house ?
Why is he here ?
Tom lives here .
He doesn &apos;t know English at all .
I should not have done that . It was wrong .
I thought Tom had already tried to do that .
That &apos;s a question no one knows the answer to .
We never get enough to eat .
That &apos;s exactly what we need .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary , but he &apos;d like to meet her .
Tom wanted to be a doctor .
She is getting on .
Is this your picture ?
I hope Tom is in Boston all next week .
I hope to see you tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was so old .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom until he gets back .
I did that right away .
All the students here must study French .
It is on me .
There is one thing I don &apos;t understand .
Tom told me that he was happy .
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
I don &apos;t have that .
I turned to him for advice .
How many days did you spend in Boston ?
My father made me what I am .
Tom can do what he likes .
I didn &apos;t know you were going to be here today .
Tom won &apos;t go away .
They got to be good friends .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
I didn &apos;t want this to happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t usually do things like that .
I &apos;m busy .
I like that , too .
Is he back already ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
Tom asked Mary where her mother was .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed at home .
Why don &apos;t you look for a job ?
What kind of food do you usually eat ?
I &apos;m glad to see you , Tom .
Tom is no longer living here .
I do not understand .
Tom isn &apos;t my friend anymore .
I &apos;ll play with you .
I have almost no money now .
I don &apos;t know about that .
My mother knows Tom &apos;s mother .
I have run out of money .
They were afraid of the big dog .
My father is busy just now .
I took the book .
I need many books .
He has been sick for a week .
You &apos;re one of us now .
What are these people doing ?
Where have you been this week ?
It &apos;s under the table .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as Mary .
We &apos;re not happy with this .
That &apos;s exactly what he said .
Tom was at school .
We have everything we want .
I saw Tom .
Is that Tom &apos;s ?
I bought that book for Tom .
It is time I left here .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
It &apos;s not a game .
No one has heard Tom say Mary &apos;s name .
Thank you for being my friend .
You are what you are .
What did Tom have to do with it ?
A car &apos;s coming .
I don &apos;t see how .
We were very happy .
They don &apos;t like my friends .
Tom looks good .
It &apos;s all I need .
She met him three years ago .
What do you call this in French ?
I think your letter is under that book .
Did you speak to Tom about this ?
This is not my home .
I had no idea who she was .
We need to go visit Tom in the hospital .
I thought I asked you to come alone .
Tom wants to be at home .
I understand this .
You must stay with me .
I only wish I &apos;d been able to do more for Tom .
I know nothing about you .
I &apos;m here for you .
I didn &apos;t mean to do it .
I think you know what I mean .
Tom has a dog .
Tom was finished .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
I had to help Tom do that .
I did exactly what you told me to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that , does he ?
I don &apos;t want to go with you .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow if I can .
What &apos;s Tom have to do with it ?
Tom ate it .
They &apos;re outside .
What does that have to do with Tom ?
Tom may have been there .
You know how important this job is to me , don &apos;t you ?
They &apos;ve lost so much .
I thought that , too .
What happened to your car ?
I can &apos;t believe that .
You must do as you are told .
Tom doesn &apos;t like going to school .
I should &apos;ve done that yesterday .
Tom is a very good friend .
What &apos;s Tom found ?
It wasn &apos;t important to me .
Tom really should go to Boston .
We have until tomorrow morning .
I can &apos;t understand you .
He made believe he was a doctor .
It made me think of Tom .
Tom knows a lot about music .
Tom is like that .
I will show it to you only once .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
He had an accident .
This bed is cold .
He said he would come .
My family didn &apos;t have much money .
How do you think that makes me feel ?
They all speak French .
Where were you born ?
Tom is going to be a father .
I have Tom here with me .
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ll be back .
I know Tom &apos;s family .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
I want to live with you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have long to live .
We &apos;ll do it together .
Tom didn &apos;t want that .
I would do it if I had more time on my hands .
I &apos;m going because I want to .
My father bought me the book .
Do you have time to help me ?
Tom does that , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
It was cold in Boston .
I think it &apos;s Tom .
They took off after Tom .
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
Are you happy where you are ?
Nobody wants to be around Tom .
I have to get Tom home .
Thank you .
Tom won &apos;t be able to do that that soon .
I can &apos;t really remember .
I came to see how you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;ve been here almost three hours .
He looks young .
We both know it &apos;s too late .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
Tom has nothing to do here .
Where does he live ?
May I go ?
I wasn &apos;t able to finish doing that as soon as I thought I &apos;d be able to .
I &apos;ve changed . I &apos;m not the same man I used to be .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
I want to know how this happened and why .
I don &apos;t like what Tom is doing .
Tom said that Mary was very tired .
Tom and Mary are afraid of John .
I think Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom lives on this street .
I &apos;m not always busy .
Is this a river ?
My father has made me what I am .
My brother is coming on Monday .
Mary is my daughter .
I can &apos;t really believe that .
Who &apos;s coming with me ?
You &apos;re too young to get married .
We already ate .
I saw Tom in there .
They were sick .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my friends .
Are they here ?
How was your day today ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is doing .
Why are they saying that ?
I &apos;ll get home on Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I &apos;m here .
What more do you want ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s father .
I &apos;d like to drink some tea or coffee .
Tom is about to leave .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me .
I thought you said you were going to be working today .
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow .
I found my book .
They want to know about Tom .
I &apos;m tired .
I &apos;m almost finished .
Tom knows this isn &apos;t good .
We &apos;ll wait here .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do it .
I feel sick every morning .
No one told me about that .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
Would you like to go ?
She looks very sick .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
I want to live here .
I had to go to work .
I &apos;ve got a lot to do .
She looks happy .
Tom could speak French .
I have some money .
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
No one knows we &apos;re here .
Tom can speak French better than Mary .
Tom has to be home .
In a few years , we &apos;ll all be doing that .
Mary isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s wife .
Do you really want someone else to do it ?
We only use French at home .
Did Tom tell the truth ?
There &apos;s no reason for you to do that .
Why is everyone looking at us ?
You look very happy .
Tom &apos;s talking to himself .
I won &apos;t tell Tom .
I know exactly what Tom was doing .
Tom says that he knows you .
Tom came over yesterday with one of his friends .
That wasn &apos;t bad .
How come you don &apos;t know this ?
They look good .
Where is Tom ?
Do you know what this is ?
You should have seen it !
Tom , can you hear me ?
What &apos;s going on in this town ?
I &apos;ll never forget what you told me .
They can &apos;t see you .
Tom gave it a try .
Are you a teacher ?
Are you as tired as I am ?
We &apos;re getting married .
When my mother was young , she was very beautiful .
Tom likes to play with my dog .
I &apos;m sure that wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s dog .
What do they look like ?
We &apos;ll go after we eat .
That is his house .
I asked Tom to come yesterday , but he didn &apos;t come .
I don &apos;t think Tom has very long to live .
Thank you for trying .
No one here knows anything .
This is just what I wanted .
Have you ever seen anything like this ?
This is my family .
I &apos;m always busy .
I think Tom is afraid of your dog .
Do what you want .
It doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
I saw that movie three years ago .
I think Tom likes doing that .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
I think everything is ready .
You know what I like .
What are those ?
Tom came over .
Is it hard to learn French ?
I know what Tom is doing here .
I don &apos;t want to wait until tomorrow .
I thought Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
When do you play tennis ?
Tom loves books .
Tom came home very late last night .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
I never thought I &apos;d see him there .
Do you know whether she can speak English ?
Tom , Mary and John were all there .
We learn English at school .
Tom knows how much Mary loves him .
Do you want to be here ?
Tom told me his father wasn &apos;t home .
I &apos;ll go on my own .
I don &apos;t know what else to do .
Tom says he &apos;s doing that .
Tom &apos;s sick .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
I can &apos;t leave now .
What &apos;ll you do ?
She is old enough to know better .
I could have done it without your help .
I &apos;d like to know what you think .
I wish I could remember his name .
Tom is a good doctor .
Tom goes to school with my daughter .
My sister has been sick .
Thank you for this , Tom .
I &apos;m busy with my homework .
I hope that Tom will never do that again .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave .
Tom took his time .
Tom and Mary will know what to do .
That &apos;s not Tom . That &apos;s John .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to leave .
I want to eat something that I can only eat here .
He asked a question about it .
It &apos;s probably Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t stand .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time .
I was just about to go to bed .
This is not for you .
Tom took my car .
He came about two .
He could not bring himself to believe her story .
Why is Tom doing this ?
I like Tom better .
I want to hear the truth .
Tom left school an hour ago .
Do you have the book ?
If he has time , he will come .
Why don &apos;t you go out ?
Come swim with me .
You aren &apos;t Tom .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
He wants to come .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
I &apos;m only going to say this once .
Tom is not looking happy .
I haven &apos;t seen that in a long time .
What time do you go to bed ?
I don &apos;t remember what I wanted .
What time is it over there ?
Do you want a drink ?
Why didn &apos;t anybody do anything ?
We &apos;re still friends .
I love you , too .
I know you &apos;re right .
How young do you think Tom is ?
He asked the man to help him .
This is my daughter .
Tom is at home .
There &apos;s something here that Tom should see .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
That is her car .
Tom and Mary both want to go .
I &apos;m very sorry I came home so late .
The police will find us if we stay here .
Tom speaks French as well as Mary .
Give me something to eat .
Tom says that he loves Mary .
We &apos;re going home by car .
I have to go home .
I told Tom to do that .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who did that .
I don &apos;t like both of them .
Tom told me that he would help us .
We don &apos;t know how or why .
Tom does want this , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom and Mary had three children .
They &apos;ll need help .
That is no business of yours .
I feel sorry for him .
Tom should &apos;ve been here .
I &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
I should &apos;ve known this .
You &apos;re not like me .
You don &apos;t want to do that , do you ?
I will give him the book tomorrow .
He has a lot of money , but has almost no friends .
I &apos;ve got to go now .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
Tom wants Mary .
You know who they are .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tom says he always told Mary the truth .
What kind of question is that , Tom ?
Tom wants his children to learn French .
That boy looks like Tom .
Tom will be here .
Do you have a dog ?
What else do they need ?
That is a very good thing .
I &apos;d like to visit Boston again .
Who says I &apos;m afraid of Tom ?
It was the wrong thing to do .
Tom knew what to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like me .
I came to give you this .
You have to do that .
My family is in Boston .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom yet .
I want to do something with my life .
There &apos;s nothing I can do .
Tom is quite young .
I &apos;m not done with you .
Why does Tom want to stay in Boston ?
Tom knows everything .
Tom is hard to please .
How was Tom &apos;s party ?
That &apos;s what made me happy .
We aren &apos;t always right .
I took my shoes off .
That was our plan .
French is difficult .
Let &apos;s have a try .
That &apos;s what we want , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m getting better every day .
There are many people that don &apos;t like me .
Where did you see the woman ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know any French .
I have everything .
We &apos;re alone .
He just left .
Tom will try .
We made many mistakes .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
Tom is my boy .
I &apos;m not sure when he &apos;ll come .
Keep the dog out .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see Mary .
I &apos;ll go .
I have to stop doing this .
Tom walked off .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
I don &apos;t have time for this .
Tom said he needed more money .
How long have Tom and Mary been going out together ?
It &apos;s far from over .
Can you show me how to do this ?
Tom and I became good friends .
That &apos;s not how I see it .
I &apos;m busy here .
I &apos;m the new teacher .
Tom and Mary want to see you .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
That &apos;s what you told me .
Does it really matter ?
What does this mean ?
Do you have a large family ?
You &apos;re better off without me .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s girl .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary .
You didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Maybe we can help Tom .
This has to wait until tomorrow .
Tom needs a job .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake myself .
Maybe she won &apos;t come .
Why don &apos;t we go out ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was there .
We &apos;d better go help Tom .
They tried everything .
Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary does .
How long is that story ?
I met him just now .
She asked him questions .
We &apos;re going to have a baby .
We &apos;ll wait .
It &apos;s not important .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tom and Mary are getting married soon .
He lives near my house .
The train was about to leave the station .
Where does Tom want to do that ?
I don &apos;t like your friends at all .
Do you have a son ?
I &apos;m not sure whether Tom heard it or not .
They &apos;re waiting for an answer .
Tom got very angry with Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to ever do that again .
Please take off your hat .
I don &apos;t see you .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s .
What do you know about that ?
We &apos;ve run out of beer .
I ate too much food yesterday .
What &apos;ll you drink , Tom ?
Tom wasn &apos;t busy .
I can &apos;t remember .
He wants a watch just like yours .
Why do you want it ?
What is truth ?
Come here , Tom .
The reason I &apos;m here is because I was asked to come .
My father isn &apos;t home .
I &apos;ll see you in there .
I want to buy something to eat .
What else do you have ?
It &apos;s not going to be hard to do this .
I don &apos;t know how to stop it .
Tom &apos;ll be ready .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
I can &apos;t find my shoes .
Let &apos;s play tennis after school .
I know what that &apos;s like .
It &apos;s good to be here .
I already know who you are .
I love you more than her .
Does Tom know how to do this ?
I thought about Tom .
Tom wants one .
We don &apos;t have a car .
Tom isn &apos;t around .
I know what I think .
I &apos;m going to go see Tom .
He is afraid of his father .
Have it your own way .
Mary is beautiful .
I couldn &apos;t keep my mind off of Tom .
Have you tried it before ?
Tom &apos;ll remember .
We &apos;ll take this .
Tom will spend tomorrow here .
Tom does like you .
We &apos;ll have to live with that .
I want to get married , just not to you .
I know exactly where it is .
I should go help Tom .
You &apos;re not as old as I thought you were .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming .
I made it .
Tom knows more .
Is Tom Mary &apos;s son ?
I want us to be friends again .
I think I &apos;d like to do that .
I think about Tom all the time .
Would you like more coffee ?
Who wrote this letter ?
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen you around here before .
I don &apos;t want any more coffee .
I can swim very fast .
I wonder what Tom is doing now .
I &apos;m so sorry .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to do that .
Can you come for dinner tonight ?
Tom did it very well .
Tom doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have enough time .
Who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
I &apos;m from the city .
I don &apos;t think he can help you .
Tell me what you want me to do .
He told me about it .
I don &apos;t need anything now .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Come home at once .
Are you ready ?
Can you speak French ?
The bus is coming .
When are we going to do it ?
Tom comes here every three days .
What am I going to do about Tom ?
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
Tom came to see you yesterday .
Did you write this book ?
Is there anything that I can do for you ?
Tom knew what he was doing .
I went to school with Tom .
Tom should study French .
I &apos;m one of your students .
There are too many of them .
Tom was doing that here yesterday .
How long do you plan to stay ?
I &apos;ll be right with you .
He seems as busy as ever .
I &apos;m going to bed early tonight .
I &apos;m here because of Tom .
This is his car , I think .
You can &apos;t believe a word of it .
Tom works fast .
I can &apos;t help .
I &apos;m worried about Tom .
That &apos;s a good thing to have .
I can wait .
Tom didn &apos;t learn anything in school .
I want to speak to Tom .
Tom has something he wants to say .
I didn &apos;t stay there very long .
Everyone &apos;s busy .
Are you two happy ?
We must go to school .
What has become of your sister ?
What time did they leave ?
Tom is Mary &apos;s friend .
I like to know what &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s what I told her .
What was Tom doing out there all by himself ?
They want to help .
No one is there .
What did Tom write ?
You don &apos;t even know how .
I can only stay a few minutes .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m going to go home .
You don &apos;t have to work today .
I remember the first time .
I &apos;m very tired from work .
What else did you expect ?
I don &apos;t know him at all .
Just tell the truth .
I can &apos;t let you do that .
When can we eat ?
Do you have any food ?
I don &apos;t know what to do for dinner .
I need this back by tomorrow .
I think that it &apos;s possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t want to be rich .
My parents are out of town .
Tom loves his job .
We should &apos;ve stayed in Australia until Monday .
Is Tom in Boston ?
I &apos;m not exactly surprised .
Tom looked good .
Tom didn &apos;t see me .
I &apos;m not ready yet .
Do you really want to know the truth ?
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
He has not seen much of the world .
What is the doctor doing ?
I want to see the movie .
Tom is coming for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to do .
I like that answer .
That &apos;s for sure .
I &apos;m the one who told Tom about your party .
You said you &apos;d go to Boston with me .
I &apos;m not happy about this .
Tom usually does what he says he &apos;ll do .
Tom is trying to understand .
This is too much for me .
I &apos;m probably not the only one here who can &apos;t do that .
Did you say something ?
I wouldn &apos;t be too sure if I were you .
You will need time to understand .
Can we believe that ?
I don &apos;t have a problem with this .
Tom is not as old as you .
She knows the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston .
What kind of English is that ?
I don &apos;t mind if it &apos;s a little cold .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you here .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have even been there .
I have a friend who loves me .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
We met them yesterday .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
I love books .
I &apos;ll tell Tom .
We should visit Boston again .
They &apos;re after us .
I need some coffee .
I would like to go , too .
I don &apos;t like this one .
He said that he didn &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve been on the phone all afternoon .
Does he have many books ?
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom is probably cold .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I want to go to Boston with you .
I don &apos;t need to do that if I don &apos;t want to .
I was so worried about you .
Can I do it again ?
They might be able to help us .
Tom knew that I was ready .
I &apos;m doing fine .
Tom &apos;s father is rich .
You &apos;re a woman .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is happy or not .
I really don &apos;t think I can do that .
I couldn &apos;t go to work because I was sick .
I &apos;ve been very busy since this morning .
Tom arrived late .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I &apos;ve read a lot of books .
Tom is sure .
Tom is looking at you .
Tom speaks French .
You &apos;re with me , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m free tonight .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let me leave .
I don &apos;t like being home alone .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
I &apos;ve been there before .
We &apos;ll help you out .
I can &apos;t see it .
I want to know what &apos;s going on out here .
What do you have for me ?
No one saw us .
My mother isn &apos;t at home .
It could be important .
Tom didn &apos;t do that for us .
Tom is doing everything he can to help .
It won &apos;t be a problem .
I have a big brother .
Is that why you did this ?
This is always the way it has been .
I believe I have now told you everything .
You &apos;re sick !
Tom really made you happy , didn &apos;t he ?
Are you always busy ?
Could you drive Tom home ?
Tom goes to school with Mary .
Tom is from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
What is Tom doing here ?
If we &apos;re going to do this , let &apos;s do it right .
He doesn &apos;t eat this , does he ?
You know Tom likes Boston .
Tom likes Boston .
I no longer believe it .
That &apos;s not what I wanted hear .
I &apos;m not going to be afraid anymore .
I &apos;m going to get married again .
Where is the train station ?
Did Tom go , too ?
I &apos;m not doing this for me .
Tom said that he was going to help .
When is Tom going to come over ?
I love it !
Tom is always busy .
What &apos;s going on here ?
Tom said he was busy .
You can &apos;t just not do your job .
The food &apos;s not ready yet .
Can we not talk about this just now ?
They aren &apos;t waiting for the bus .
You don &apos;t seem to understand anything .
Tom &apos;s French is hard to understand .
I should visit Tom .
Tom is here because of me .
I feel well .
Tom fell into the river .
I knew you &apos;d like Tom .
Tom wanted to talk with you .
Tom wants us to leave .
The girl talking with Tom is Mary .
I &apos;m sure about this .
I can &apos;t help Tom with that .
I don &apos;t know how you can eat that .
Tom hasn &apos;t come here yet .
I have a book .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have said that .
Tom would never do something like that .
I went to the doctor .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I knew you &apos;d come after me .
Why do they do it ?
She &apos;s young and beautiful .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here .
They can &apos;t do this .
I didn &apos;t write anything .
How long was Tom there ?
No one seems to listen to us anymore .
You &apos;d better take this .
Are you sure Tom is happy ?
How am I going to get home ?
We want to know why .
You must do it yourself .
No one &apos;s home .
I think we &apos;re going to be fine .
That was fast .
I have known her for two years .
I took the bus back .
Tom isn &apos;t like that .
I don &apos;t think you know what you want .
Tom knows what you said .
It &apos;s not over yet .
Would you like some ?
I can &apos;t put up with it any longer .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a long time .
I just saw Tom .
Can you give that to Tom ?
Did Tom tell you that ?
That &apos;s not what we do .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
I should &apos;ve stayed at home today .
You &apos;re here .
I didn &apos;t see any children .
We &apos;ve got another three days .
Tom has a big family .
Why did he do that ?
You &apos;re doing fine .
The weather is beautiful today .
How could it be ?
We want our money .
I can understand Tom .
Tom wants a dog .
She wrote a new book .
The problem is that my son doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I have a cat .
What does it look like to you ?
I have something for you .
I &apos;ll get these .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
We know that .
I have money for you .
I was late to school .
I &apos;ll think about it .
How important are children to you ?
Do you know where she is ?
He said good night to his parents .
I am a good boy .
How late is it ?
Tom gave us some food .
It was a good answer .
We saw this coming .
I like what I do .
Tom looks like he &apos;s sorry .
What kind of man are you ?
I knew you &apos;d go there .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
Do you want something to eat ?
Tom knows the truth .
I want to be here for Tom .
You must see a doctor .
What happened to the money ?
The man &apos;s name is Tom .
Tell Tom I don &apos;t like him .
I have nothing else to do .
I &apos;ll be around back .
Give that back to me .
Tom has more books than he can read .
I almost forgot it .
No one says that anymore .
Where &apos;s your school ?
I will do anything for him .
You have a brother , don &apos;t you ?
Can you do that ?
They aren &apos;t happy to see you .
What is she doing in his office ?
How is your wife doing ?
How is the weather there ?
Tom is my friend .
We can try .
I &apos;ll be around all day .
Tom is through doing that .
That &apos;s not how you do it .
They don &apos;t listen to me .
Tom was afraid to go to sleep .
I found you .
Tom is thirty .
I want to be here with you .
I &apos;ve eaten .
I &apos;m so cold .
It can &apos;t be !
They are good people .
What do you want with Tom ?
He became rich .
We &apos;ll do it when we have time .
I don &apos;t see why we need to do this .
He was late for school yesterday .
Tom asked Mary if she was busy .
I &apos;m not going to ask you again .
Is that your mother ?
Her dog isn &apos;t very fast .
Did you hear what I said ?
My father is as busy as ever .
I think I &apos;ll take this one .
Tom is late .
I &apos;m a long way from home .
This isn &apos;t about you , Tom .
I &apos;ve got a question .
I &apos;m not a student .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
Tom knows what &apos;s wrong .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
I want to ask Tom what he &apos;ll do .
Tom has to go to work .
Is that what you want ?
They made me go there .
You &apos;ve got to stop doing this .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got to go .
I only want Tom .
Tom and Mary are still there .
I love my dog .
Could you tell me your name again ?
When did you go to work ?
This never would &apos;ve happened if you &apos;d done it the way I told you to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me to do that .
I have no idea what &apos;s going on here .
Tom is a student .
I don &apos;t like the way he speaks to me .
I &apos;m going to Boston with you .
I didn &apos;t ask you for your opinion .
They know what happened .
I didn &apos;t know that your mother lived with you .
I need a little time .
We don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
When will you be free ?
Tom left before I arrived .
Where are you going ?
They don &apos;t help .
Tom has to stop doing that .
You didn &apos;t have to come into the office today .
I know what &apos;s up .
He &apos;s old enough to go to school .
You &apos;re after Tom .
What time do you want to meet tomorrow ?
Why does Tom think I &apos;m here ?
I must say something .
You may read this book .
Tom has to tell the truth .
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him .
I &apos;ll see you around .
Do you want me to do it ?
Where is my beer ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like us ?
I have more books than I can read .
I have no money .
I don &apos;t think Tom would want to go to Boston with you .
Tom fell off his bicycle .
We have a lot of homework .
That &apos;s exactly what I want to hear .
Nobody ever told me that before .
Tom made these for you .
I don &apos;t have to go , but you do .
His house is easy to find .
Tom didn &apos;t even look at Mary .
Don &apos;t you want to go to the party ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is busy or not .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
I should probably tell Tom I &apos;m busy .
Tom lives in Australia .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come yet .
The only one I saw in the park was Tom .
He is here !
What are you wearing ?
No one knows that I like you .
He can no longer wait .
He knows how to swim .
We &apos;ll take Tom home .
You &apos;re my child .
She was alone in the house .
I love your daughter .
Why isn &apos;t Tom playing with us ?
You must do the work , even if you do not like it .
We should study .
We &apos;ll get to that .
Why would I tell you ?
They aren &apos;t there .
I don &apos;t think there is a doctor here .
I have a lot to do today .
Do you have a wife ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money to buy a house .
I forgot what I was about to say .
I &apos;ve got more .
I &apos;m very surprised that Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in the city .
I &apos;ll take one .
It &apos;s been ten years since I came to this town .
Tom is saying something .
Tom wanted to do everything himself .
What else can I do to help ?
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was so happy .
I know that much myself .
I can &apos;t read this .
Tom walked over to where Mary was .
What I need is a beer .
Tom knows how to drive a car .
I can eat anything .
That can &apos;t be helped .
Tom is with his mother .
They &apos;re coming again .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s why Tom isn &apos;t here .
What could you have done ?
I want to know where you heard that .
They don &apos;t want it .
That &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
What do you think that is ?
What time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
I found it later .
Tom isn &apos;t finished doing that .
How long do I have to wait for the next bus ?
Why is Tom home ?
Tell us what to do .
We don &apos;t have much time .
Nobody can understand it .
I have one of those , too .
You can go home now if you like .
Tom bought his son a car .
Is there anything else we need to do ?
Tom is behind you .
If the weather is good , I &apos;ll go .
I have a big dog .
I am able to drive a car .
I &apos;m no good for you .
We tried for almost an hour .
Tom asked Mary if she had a dog .
Tom &apos;s not coming , because I don &apos;t want him to .
They must have made a mistake .
Tom wanted to get married .
You know Tom doesn &apos;t like that .
Tom may have to do that .
Tom did as I told him .
What &apos;s Tom going to think ?
She began to talk to the dog .
Come to us .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
I have to get that .
Tom &apos;ll come .
Tom is like one of the family .
I need them .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
I came for Tom .
I still haven &apos;t told Tom .
This is the first time I &apos;ve been here .
The dog seems to be sick .
You don &apos;t need to go .
Is this hat yours ?
I &apos;m happy to have you here , Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes it .
Tom doesn &apos;t look good .
What is it like ?
Why are you so busy ?
You live too far away .
Tom said he thought that Mary was in Boston .
Let &apos;s take a bus .
I didn &apos;t know about the party .
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
This is mine , and that &apos;s yours .
I gave you my word .
I &apos;m quite sure of that .
This isn &apos;t about money .
I &apos;m not going to your house .
They never give up .
Tom has a wife and three children .
Tom almost never gets sick .
I found the money that Tom had lost .
How &apos;s your sister ?
Tom works here .
I thought I &apos;d go with you .
What should I buy ?
I don &apos;t like to think about it .
Tom comes home at around six .
You may talk as much as you like .
I can &apos;t leave .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
She was too tired to speak .
I didn &apos;t expect that to come from you .
What have you got ?
There &apos;s more .
We can &apos;t leave yet . We need to wait for Tom .
There was almost nothing in the room .
I wish I was with you .
My mother always gets up early in the morning .
What a woman !
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary knows why John doesn &apos;t like her .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do that again .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is now .
Did Tom see anything ?
I only know what Tom told me .
My children don &apos;t speak French yet .
Tom walked away .
Tom went out to eat .
I don &apos;t understand what he wants .
Tom gave Mary the money .
You &apos;d like Tom .
Why would you do something like that ?
You know I love you .
Tom didn &apos;t think so at all .
Are you a teacher or a student ?
You should have one of us do it .
Please wait for thirty minutes .
My mother has made me what I am today .
Tom may have to help Mary .
Tom saw it , too .
I did what Tom told me to do .
You have work to do .
I don &apos;t understand Tom .
Tom will be back in three hours .
How are your parents ?
That is my school .
You must do it .
I have not had anything to eat since this morning .
What were Tom and Mary doing here ?
Tom made a lot of money .
I &apos;ll give that to Tom .
They get along like a cat and a dog .
Tom did what he wanted to do .
They &apos;re too big .
You should try to learn a little French .
I can &apos;t remember why I was there .
I can &apos;t swim .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom do that ?
You know what it &apos;s like .
Tom said that he was fine .
We had nothing to do with it .
I &apos;m thirty years old .
What &apos;s the matter , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need money to have a good time .
The day isn &apos;t over yet .
The water was cold .
I might never see you again .
Get back here .
I know what you did in Boston .
I really want to know .
I &apos;m not good at tennis .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really here .
What are they going to do ?
If you &apos;d just asked me , I would &apos;ve done it .
I &apos;ve got to do this now .
Come outside .
Tom likes his job .
He is no longer a boy .
We know why .
I want to sleep a little more .
Do you know what &apos;s become of Tom ?
I will help you .
Tom knows what Mary is doing .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
This one is on me .
Tom asked me to do it .
Tom isn &apos;t as busy as he seems to be .
I never wanted you to go .
You know what I mean .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
Tom is good at this .
Tom does that quite often .
Come with me , Tom .
When does the last train leave ?
Tom must care about you very much .
What &apos;s Tom going to say ?
What time do you go to work ?
I &apos;ve got to get Tom home .
Tom has been here for about three years .
Tom doesn &apos;t want that .
Tom asked Mary questions .
You need a plan .
I don &apos;t want to get sick .
Have you tried it yet ?
I &apos;ll come tomorrow .
Why would Tom leave ?
I have nothing to eat .
That should please everyone .
Tom is too busy to go today .
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
Could you please tell me how to do that ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to see me like that .
Tom says he &apos;s OK .
Why do you want to know that ?
You can &apos;t go .
I don &apos;t like her hat .
Why do you want Tom ?
She is far from beautiful .
She said she had been happy .
I will make up for it next time .
Maybe you should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
I thought you might want a drink .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
I &apos;ll be coming home .
This is a better house than the other one .
I have a friend living in Boston .
What kind of car do you drive ?
They have very little to live on .
Are we all here ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to like that .
They don &apos;t know my name .
I love you for who you are .
Do you want to eat anything ?
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
Tom didn &apos;t know when he &apos;d be back .
This is too good to be true .
My opinion really doesn &apos;t matter .
I like this dog .
Nobody went there .
Tom and Mary are John &apos;s children .
A lot has happened while you &apos;ve been gone .
Tom is better looking than you .
What &apos;ll Tom think ?
We don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
What did you do in Boston ?
Where did you eat last night ?
That &apos;s for Tom .
He never saw his brother again .
Let &apos;s leave when you are ready .
I have a wife and family .
Are you free ?
Tom loves you very much .
Tom is too tired to study .
What did Tom know ?
What should I do now ?
Give me a little money .
You &apos;ll have to come with me .
Tom was too tired to speak .
I came by bus .
I love Australia .
Tom wasn &apos;t bad .
How many times has Tom been here ?
I heard that Tom does that .
You &apos;re rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to Australia next week .
All of us can speak French .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
Who is your friend ?
Tom saw Mary .
May I go with you ?
I may have told you this story before .
Tom seems very happy .
When do you usually go to bed ?
I &apos;m going to stay home tonight .
She may have been beautiful when she was young .
I wish Tom were here now .
Do you know anything about his family ?
It &apos;s all going to be fine .
Can I ask why ?
Tom is too old to be living on his own .
I understand why you &apos;re here .
It doesn &apos;t matter what he said .
It &apos;s been three days .
He seems to have been rich .
Who are you ?
He doesn &apos;t have any friends .
We all speak French .
You need this .
What do you want to do in Boston ?
How is Tom today ?
You can wait in this room .
Tom wants to see me .
I know where they are .
Why didn &apos;t you come ?
They &apos;re now alone .
They look very tired .
I think you understand me .
What &apos;s the matter ? Just tell me .
Is all this money yours ?
What else do you know ?
What &apos;ll you eat for dinner tonight ?
Please tell me what that is .
You are what you eat .
Tom lost his new watch .
I don &apos;t think Tom is finished .
Tom only knows how to speak French .
Tom isn &apos;t so old that he can &apos;t work .
Tom &apos;s sorry .
Tom seems to know a lot about Australia .
It &apos;s nice to have friends .
Why did you say that to Tom ?
I could write a book .
Give it up .
Can we talk ?
He couldn &apos;t find the house .
Tom and Mary were busy .
I remember the day you were born very well .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
He came by bus .
Tom doesn &apos;t have as many friends as Mary does .
What are you doing today ?
Do you know the reason ?
Can Tom see us ?
I want to want what you want .
How did you come by these books ?
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
Tom asked again .
I want Tom to have this .
Tom is talking to himself .
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
Tom is all by himself .
Where does Tom go to school ?
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
Why didn &apos;t Tom say anything ?
They say that she &apos;ll get married soon .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
You don &apos;t have to help .
I will do anything for you .
I don &apos;t like Tom and I never will .
Tom is afraid .
Don &apos;t worry about me .
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Tom has my book .
This is a good thing .
That &apos;s what I need to do .
You don &apos;t have to do this for me .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
I don &apos;t want to be here .
Tom can play tennis better than Mary .
Do you know what time that accident happened ?
What &apos;s your opinion ?
I want to be with my family .
I should tell Tom everything .
How did it end ?
What is Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name ?
He will soon become a father .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
You don &apos;t look like Tom .
I think that I won &apos;t do that .
Tom is the father .
Tom wants that .
I told Tom I was tired .
How do you say &quot; I love you &quot; in French ?
Tom is going to do that for Mary .
He is quite right .
Tom doesn &apos;t work for us anymore .
Is it important ?
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
She doesn &apos;t seem happy .
All you have to do is give him a little help .
I am a student of this school .
I &apos;ve already finished my homework .
I have a good idea .
We won &apos;t forget .
She died yesterday afternoon .
Do you know what Tom wants ?
Tom has a sister in Boston .
Tom was my friend .
Tom was really good .
Tom will come later .
I &apos;m just doing my job .
We all want Tom to be happy .
Maybe we &apos;ll try again later .
Tom knew he had to help Mary .
We don &apos;t have that .
Tom can help you .
We have all the time in the world .
I don &apos;t understand this at all .
Are you in on this ?
How did you come to hear that ?
It &apos;s far from here .
I saw Tom do it .
Tom never saw Mary .
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
We had nothing to talk about .
It &apos;s not yours .
I &apos;m going to give you something .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like it .
My mother is angry .
Do it now .
She &apos;s been working all day long .
I have work for Tom .
I gave that to Tom .
I already knew the truth .
I have three children .
What exactly do you want to know ?
You don &apos;t have to stay .
You can talk here .
I just want to be with you .
Come along .
Tom asked Mary why she &apos;d done that .
Tom saw me give Mary some money .
I think he did it .
It &apos;s the truth .
Tom wasn &apos;t here when I came in .
I think this is mine .
Tom knows .
The food was very good .
I know it well .
I &apos;d like to have dinner with you .
I don &apos;t know what I want .
I don &apos;t like the name Tom .
I have a sister .
I &apos;ve tried .
Everyone is tired .
Do you have enough money ?
She is five years old .
He is not the boy who came here yesterday .
My son is not old enough for school .
I love you more than he loves you .
The only thing we can do is wait .
Why were you eating by yourself ?
He may be able to come tomorrow .
This won &apos;t be easy .
I want you here .
Did Tom have dinner ?
Tom and Mary are rich .
What is he doing ?
I want a lot more .
I forgot about that .
I feel so happy when I &apos;m with you .
You didn &apos;t tell him anything ?
Come with me .
It &apos;s cold out here .
I know him by name .
I &apos;m all right .
I &apos;d like to be with Tom .
All of my friends like Tom .
We live here .
I think we should do some more .
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
Where does she live now ?
They &apos;re Tom and Mary .
You have time .
He will be ready .
She wouldn &apos;t be happy with him .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
I can hardly hear you .
Tom is just like us .
How far did Tom go ?
We &apos;re getting it .
She can &apos;t find her hat .
Tom is not one of us .
You can stay here as long as you like .
Tom likes to do almost everything by himself .
Maybe Tom should study French .
I need to get back to work .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
Who gave you this ?
Tom hasn &apos;t told me anything about you .
Tom is going to be a teacher .
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary .
Is this Tom &apos;s book ?
Where were your parents ?
I &apos;m happy to see you here .
I know you &apos;re thinking about me .
We speak French at home .
He is tired of reading .
I won &apos;t see him anymore .
Tom was one of my first students .
Tom is old .
Can we have a word with you ?
Tom has been good to me .
When are you free ?
He had friends all over the world .
He gave them food and money .
Tom will get married next month .
I started reading the book .
I don &apos;t know what they do .
I have to go back to Boston .
Tom wants his money today .
There &apos;s a lot of work to do .
I &apos;m not able to swim .
What can you do for me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary wants to go .
I can &apos;t see anything .
I love your car .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
I bought the car .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
He didn &apos;t show up .
Tom and Mary need help .
Tom lives with his father .
I don &apos;t get you .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
We know who did it .
I know that you know that I know .
We do almost everything together .
He can speak and write French .
Do you have time ?
Just get to work .
Tom couldn &apos;t find it .
Tom is my father .
Is that your book ?
I was up all night .
He &apos;s done his homework .
I &apos;m not going to tell you where Tom is .
We have to wait for him .
Can &apos;t we leave it as it is ?
Did you ever try ?
I don &apos;t want to see that .
I &apos;ll wait outside .
I can &apos;t talk now .
What &apos;re you doing in my office ?
I have nothing to do today .
I think Tom is up to something .
Tom will like this .
I don &apos;t know her at all .
Why are you doing this to Tom ?
I &apos;m too busy to go .
She needs someone who is able to understand her .
They aren &apos;t here yet .
It looks easy when you do it .
Tom said that he &apos;d go to Boston .
He must have seen it .
I do want to see you .
I have no idea of what to expect .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
Mary is not my sister .
What kind of car does Tom drive ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to eat for dinner .
I &apos;ve known Tom longer than I &apos;ve known you .
This dog is Tom &apos;s .
It is possible that you have already read this book .
How &apos;re you doing at home ?
Don &apos;t say it like that .
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
You &apos;ve got to stop , Tom .
He is very young .
I have it at home .
How does Tom do it ?
I know you know this .
Tom has done it already .
I would like to visit Boston .
Tom asked Mary where John was .
Tom was right about one thing .
Tom doesn &apos;t come here anymore .
Tom seemed to have been very busy .
Tom isn &apos;t like his brother .
We can &apos;t stay for dinner .
I want to try it . It looks fun .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I think I &apos;ll take it .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was a doctor .
I thought you &apos;d say that .
That &apos;s what I don &apos;t know .
May I say something ?
You could &apos;ve said something .
I have a sister and a brother .
Tell me what I need to do .
They &apos;d like that .
He &apos;ll be here again .
I want to tell you something .
I don &apos;t want to do it like that .
That was really difficult .
Tom and I both want to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t really like you .
I don &apos;t want Tom there .
It &apos;s yours .
Tom isn &apos;t coming today .
He is at home today .
Don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going on ?
What do you do in the afternoon ?
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
Tom knows where Mary is .
Please have a drink .
Tom told Mary he had a lot of money .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
Tom seemed surprised at the news .
Let us go .
Tom couldn &apos;t help .
I come from a big family .
We want to get out of here .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I &apos;ve got to go .
Tom said he thought Mary was in Boston .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
Tom can &apos;t swim as well as Mary can .
Tom is too young to get married .
Tom and Mary both need new shoes .
We have to study .
Tom wants money .
May I go out to play when I have read this book ?
What &apos;re you up to today ?
My wife looked surprised .
We &apos;ve been together for three years .
I can &apos;t wait for him any longer .
Tom knew everything .
I am sorry that my friend is not here .
Don &apos;t say that word .
I have never felt better .
Tom wants our help .
Is there something we can do for you ?
You don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom anything .
I wish I had more .
She comes to visit us every now and then .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom is angry with us .
Tom asked Mary if she was free the next day .
I know what I saw .
I have little money now .
I have to go to Boston .
You &apos;re old enough now .
You do understand me , don &apos;t you ?
I made tea .
All these books are mine .
I found the game easy .
I usually agree with her .
I want to know what you think .
I think you might be right .
I know how much you love Tom .
You have everything you need , right ?
Tom thinks he knows what Mary is doing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you .
I know that , Tom .
They &apos;re in Boston .
I like this book better than that one .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house .
I don &apos;t like that .
I have to be there .
Tom does that , doesn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s not what you said .
I &apos;m very good at what I do .
I want to visit Tom .
When did you finish it ?
What did Tom ever do to you ?
Don &apos;t you want to go with us ?
I was worried for nothing .
Tom asked Mary not to go alone .
I came for you .
You know it &apos;ll be fine .
He is playing here .
Tom has friends .
I &apos;ll get the book .
I &apos;m happy , too .
I think you &apos;ll like it .
I want you home in time for dinner .
Tom may be on the next train .
We know how Tom is .
I &apos;m sure Tom loves you .
I only have a week to get this done .
He still lives with his parents .
I &apos;m from Boston .
Tom would help us if he could .
It is easy to play tennis .
Did you like this book ?
I like Tom , but he doesn &apos;t like me .
I don &apos;t want to buy anything .
Tom and Mary have gone to Australia .
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
How many more days will it take Tom to finish doing that ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I thought Tom would be too busy to help us .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I can speak French better than Tom .
I don &apos;t like that one .
I already said that .
My brother is good at playing tennis .
Tom and only Tom knows the whole truth .
You aren &apos;t rich .
Everyone was there .
I &apos;m going to try .
Do you want to eat ?
This is not a hospital .
I could do nothing .
I came here to give you something .
I don &apos;t see Tom &apos;s car .
Mary is Tom &apos;s wife .
I like Tom .
Tom can sleep in my room .
I want Tom to come with us .
You only live once .
He died ten years ago .
I &apos;d like to see them both .
We know it &apos;s you .
That wouldn &apos;t be good .
I &apos;m in my car .
I &apos;ve never done it like that before .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
This isn &apos;t my money .
I had an accident .
Tom says I look like a girl .
I want to be more like Tom .
I &apos;m really busy at the moment .
I want to have a job that I love .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will like this idea .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom is doing .
Tom should &apos;ve known .
I had nothing to say to Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t give up .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
It &apos;s great to see you .
I think you know why I &apos;m here .
Who was the girl you were talking to ?
You know I can &apos;t .
He can &apos;t be under thirty .
She will give you what money she has .
Tom can drive .
Where are they taking you ?
They &apos;ll find Tom .
Let them talk .
Do you want this job ?
Tom doesn &apos;t talk to me about anything anymore .
You can &apos;t always do what you want .
Can I bring you anything else ?
It &apos;s really very easy to do that .
What are you going as ?
Tom wasn &apos;t OK .
We &apos;ll see what Tom has to say .
You wouldn &apos;t have to say anything .
Tom said nothing .
Tom is there , too .
We &apos;ll ask Tom .
Tom knows Australia well .
What did Tom do this time ?
I think that I &apos;ll do that .
I know the truth .
Tom has come a long way .
That &apos;s how Tom did it .
I &apos;m going to go find Tom .
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
This car is Tom &apos;s .
I could swim well even when I was a boy .
We have a lot of work to do .
The cat is on the table .
I only just left Tom .
I &apos;ll come when I have done my homework .
Tom said he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
Tom is quite right .
He has come a long way .
Are you happy ?
Tom said good night to Mary and left .
Is he a friend of yours ?
Tom isn &apos;t here yet .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
I like it in Boston .
I think no one knows .
Could you do that for me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want our help .
Tom was very old .
This is exactly what I wanted to see .
I have to know why .
That &apos;s right .
I might be a few minutes late .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
He told me that he had lost his watch .
I know what I like .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want that .
How long do you plan to stay in this country ?
He says he won &apos;t come .
What &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?
Do you want to come ?
The problem is in that we don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
He was too young to go to school .
I just need to know you &apos;re OK .
I don &apos;t like my school .
This I have to see .
I &apos;ll be there for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will leave Boston .
I think they like us .
I am in the house .
I tried to tell Tom .
Do you really live alone ?
Did your mother make those ?
Tom and Mary have come .
Tom wants a word with you .
Tom never saw Mary again .
We were just talking about you .
Tom won &apos;t come .
I was already tired .
Tom no longer lives here .
I don &apos;t have to do that .
Tom will never know .
You &apos;re not going to like it .
I &apos;m about to take Tom home .
It seems that no one knows the truth .
I made a mistake .
I like being in Boston .
Tom is from Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
Don &apos;t play in this room .
They never did anything .
We know what we &apos;re doing .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
Please give me some water .
It will be over in a moment .
I knew you &apos;d be happy here .
How does this look ?
What did Tom tell Mary about John ?
I went there yesterday .
I want to help .
I have seen him many times .
You need a lot of water .
I want Tom to go .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
Why didn &apos;t I see that ?
Are you in Boston ?
Tom knows him .
What is it that you need ?
I &apos;m going to be a teacher .
Tom &apos;s busy .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
I gave up .
Tom came by himself .
I was just here yesterday .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
I have to study .
This is what I like about you .
I saw Tom three hours ago .
I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
Tom knows us .
We get on OK .
He asked for more money .
Tom gave up .
Tom is thirty now .
What exactly do you want to do ?
I am sure .
I wonder why Tom did that .
Tom said Mary wouldn &apos;t be here tomorrow .
She didn &apos;t tell me her name .
My brother lives there .
He had one daughter .
Can you read this ?
I could have helped .
Tom did everything for Mary .
The only one here who can do that is Tom .
I was only gone an hour .
Tom wasn &apos;t in .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed yet .
How did Tom do this ?
I &apos;ll do what needs to be done .
I &apos;m going to be there .
I know what this is about .
I believe we &apos;ve seen enough .
You have no idea what this is , do you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t stand being alone with Mary .
I don &apos;t want you to see this .
The child will be six .
Is that Tom &apos;s car ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to do that ?
We &apos;re having a lot of fun .
I &apos;ve had enough to eat .
I don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing this .
I &apos;m not your girlfriend .
That &apos;s what they all say .
Where are you taking us ?
I &apos;m not from Boston .
I was just about to say that .
How was work today ?
I like this room .
Nobody knows where he lives .
I just want to go home and sleep .
She is a bit like her mother .
Tom told me .
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
He thinks he knows everything .
If you speak French , I won &apos;t understand .
We both saw you .
I can see why you don &apos;t like Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to read this if he doesn &apos;t want to .
He is no longer a child .
What are you people doing ?
I don &apos;t want to go to school tomorrow .
May I leave now ?
I want to tell her the truth .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
It &apos;s time for bed .
Tom wants to make everyone happy .
What does he want to do ?
That was not the only problem .
Tom has lost his job .
She is angry with me .
I already know .
She is talking .
It is long way to the town .
What do you like to eat ?
Tom left a few minutes ago .
He was very old .
Tom looks very happy .
I &apos;m a friend of Tom and Mary &apos;s .
He did not eat anything yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t even want to go to the park .
Tom may have told Mary about it .
You know what you have to do .
Tom never comes .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
Why don &apos;t you go to bed ?
Tom is too young to drink .
Tom didn &apos;t have the time .
Tom will be at home tomorrow .
I &apos;ve got no time for that .
I said don &apos;t do that .
I &apos;ll go by car .
You &apos;ve made me very happy .
Tom likes to be here .
Tom is having dinner .
Please don &apos;t ask me to do this again .
That &apos;s all I need .
That won &apos;t be hard to do .
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
Can we do that before Monday ?
You are not a child any more .
Tom says he &apos;s never had a girlfriend .
I was tired , so I didn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t want to go to the hospital .
Is it far away ?
I &apos;ve always wanted to visit another country .
No one will believe him .
I have no idea what I &apos;m doing here .
Tom can speak French and English .
Is Tom there ?
Why is she here ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
You must be Tom .
It &apos;s not always like that .
Why &apos;s Tom doing that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Tom isn &apos;t in .
Can you give me this one , please ?
Tom has a sister who likes to play tennis .
I got up about five .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
Thank you for that .
Tom is the one with the problem , not me .
You need to stop saying that .
I asked him to be here by six .
She loves Tom more than I do .
I can &apos;t help you with that .
We want to talk to you .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
I understand French .
I still don &apos;t believe it .
You can hear everything .
Why won &apos;t you listen to me ?
Tom didn &apos;t come home .
Tom didn &apos;t ask Mary to do anything .
No one &apos;s going to see us .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
Let Tom go .
Tom no longer loves Mary .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
That &apos;s not the way it happened at all .
Let &apos;s do this later .
I didn &apos;t speak with Tom .
Tom loves money .
You may speak to him .
I want to wait another week .
Tom isn &apos;t able to drive yet .
It &apos;s yours if you want it .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
Where is my brother ?
Tom wanted to see Mary .
He isn &apos;t happy at all .
I don &apos;t want this .
Maybe Tom will know what to do .
Maybe you can &apos;t hear me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait that long .
It was very cold last month .
We &apos;re going alone .
Tom left the book on the table .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand French well .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday !
How do you like your new house ?
What &apos;s Tom got ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a cat .
Where does he work now ?
It &apos;s for you .
Tom is going to go to Australia .
What did Tom do yesterday afternoon ?
I just have a few questions for you .
I would like a word with you .
I don &apos;t want you to go to Boston .
It isn &apos;t true .
Tom didn &apos;t tell everyone .
Are you still up ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
There &apos;s a lot to do .
Please wait thirty minutes .
Tom might not be as happy as we think he is .
We are brother and sister .
You &apos;re not young anymore .
Why don &apos;t you go and have a look ?
I need to buy food , but I don &apos;t have enough money .
I want you to come with me to see Tom .
Tom told me about the accident .
Can you tell me anything else ?
She came .
That &apos;s how I see it .
We are a family .
Tom seems to like Boston .
We study French together .
I think Tom is out .
I have done everything I could do .
Where &apos;s your family ?
Can you help ?
Tom ate out .
Tom is going to be there .
They heard Tom .
I &apos;m going to your house .
I don &apos;t think he has anything to do with the matter .
We have to do that before Monday .
Tom would never have done that that way .
We &apos;re just looking around .
I go to work .
Boston is where I want to go .
We &apos;re back home .
No one &apos;s watching .
Let me sleep for ten more minutes .
I &apos;d like to ask a few more questions .
Tom lives only an hour away .
We must sleep outside today .
Tom gave us all the money he had on him .
Tom is going to do that for us .
Is this your bicycle ?
We &apos;re going home .
He asked me if I knew his father .
It &apos;s pretty cold .
You &apos;re always busy .
I can do that .
I like coffee better .
It &apos;s going to be good .
You don &apos;t know that .
How many books do you have ?
He has to stay in bed .
We don &apos;t want to know .
Do you have any questions ?
He is no longer living here .
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
Do you want to help me ?
The man is old .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been there .
Tom got up and went away .
Tom and Mary used to often do that together .
That must be my book .
Tom needs help .
I know what to study .
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
Tom must &apos;ve told us the truth .
Tom has a room at the hotel near the river .
You &apos;re not going , are you ?
Tom &apos;s fast .
I don &apos;t understand them .
I think I &apos;d be a good father .
I never want to see him again .
When did you buy that ?
I have some things I need to tell you .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
I found out where Tom lives .
He made her his wife .
You can wait here .
You &apos;re a good boy , Tom .
Tom told us .
If I had time , I could help you .
I &apos;m not here for you .
I can &apos;t tell you what I think .
We have to go now .
I &apos;d like to hear your opinion .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
You saw what Tom did , didn &apos;t you ?
If I were rich , I would buy it .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Did you tell Tom about this ?
I &apos;ll listen to you .
I would like to eat something .
You &apos;re no longer children .
You can study here .
How do I get over the river ?
We have to tell Tom what has happened .
We &apos;re here because of you .
Did you see it ?
I must go now .
Tom is not home right now .
I talked about music .
Tom came to school very late today .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows about this yet .
I don &apos;t need it .
We &apos;ll never do it again .
We &apos;ve found it .
I &apos;ll be free tomorrow afternoon .
Do you want Tom ?
Why don &apos;t you want to tell us the truth ?
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t have come .
It &apos;s not too late .
That was very easy .
What am I doing here ?
You &apos;d better go home .
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
It &apos;s fun to visit old friends .
We have to help Tom .
Tom is not the problem .
Tom does everything he &apos;s told .
Tom is always making me angry .
The cat was on the table .
Tom said he didn &apos;t see anything .
I &apos;m really sorry .
He has a dog .
I have no time to see you .
That &apos;s the way I like it .
Tell me where I can find Tom .
Did Tom enjoy it ?
Please go to school .
Tom has to do this .
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
I was at a friend &apos;s house .
He did what I wanted right away .
You need to go .
I should &apos;ve stayed in bed .
No one likes you .
Tom came early .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
I don &apos;t know what time it is .
You are important .
Our money ran out .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was afraid .
I &apos;d like to try doing this without your help .
It would &apos;ve been so easy .
I like your family .
What do we know ?
I can &apos;t live with you anymore .
I know you want to go home .
Tom and Mary like each other .
Are you a teacher here or a student ?
No one has said a word .
I don &apos;t remember anything else .
You might not find it .
Tom &apos;s not happy with that .
I thought Tom was ready .
Tom has made many new friends .
I &apos;ve never seen you like this before .
Which is better ?
I want you to wait for me .
What happened out here ?
How far is it from your house to town ?
I have it with me .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
I went there to see her .
I love Tom so much .
Tom really needs to tell Mary the truth .
What &apos;s Tom look like ?
Why is Tom so busy ?
Can I see you tonight ?
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
Tom is going to do that .
Let &apos;s meet Tom .
You aren &apos;t yourself today .
I don &apos;t want to go .
Why did she ask for our help ?
I &apos;m from a big family .
Don &apos;t try this at home .
Tom likes French .
I know what I need to do .
When does Tom get here ?
Tom &apos;s children are sick .
Do you really want to know what happened ?
I should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
Tom says he &apos;ll come at once .
I just don &apos;t know why .
That &apos;s probably true .
Tom is the one we want .
It &apos;s this book .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
He has a lot more money than I have .
Tom is home .
What does Tom say ?
I didn &apos;t think you were going to make it .
I want to do it myself .
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
I think I &apos;ll go visit Tom and see how he &apos;s doing .
Why can &apos;t Tom just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
Tom may not be happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at home .
I think that girl &apos;s name is Mary .
How was the game ?
Did you eat something last night ?
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
I don &apos;t understand it .
Tom is afraid of you .
What are you going to do in Boston ?
I think it &apos;s very good .
Why did you say such a thing to him ?
Who else was at the party ?
She did not say anything .
I can &apos;t quite believe that .
I was at Tom &apos;s house . Where were you ?
I &apos;ve been working .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason .
If only I &apos;d done my homework !
Let &apos;s be friends .
Did you make this yourself ?
I want to know how .
I don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
We found them .
He began to talk to the dog .
Tom has more questions .
I &apos;d better be going .
He can swim fast .
I need friends .
You don &apos;t understand anything .
I &apos;m very tired and I want to go to bed early .
What do you have to say about that ?
What does that look like to you ?
This is your hat , isn &apos;t it ?
I was with Tom last night .
I know it isn &apos;t always easy .
He has a big family .
I &apos;m one of you .
His mother didn &apos;t want to do it .
I always wanted to have a dog .
I have something else I need to give you .
We &apos;re tired .
I never got an answer from Tom .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
I want Tom to like you .
I don &apos;t really know why .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Mary .
They may go .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
What did they do ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to go to Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom had never been to Boston .
We &apos;ll do great .
I can &apos;t wait all day .
I can &apos;t leave Tom .
Tom is around thirty years old .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t here .
I think Tom would like that .
I thought as much .
I wish that I could help you .
Why don &apos;t you understand ?
I really don &apos;t understand this problem .
Tom said that he was afraid to do that .
I only wanted to talk to Tom .
I just want to sleep for a few hours .
They &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
He has nothing to do with it .
Are you happy here ?
Nobody seems to know where Tom is .
I do like Tom .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy .
How do I look tonight ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come .
I &apos;m right , aren &apos;t I ?
Tom has to go to Boston .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
He loves his daughter , but his wife doesn &apos;t .
Give me that money .
How is the family doing ?
We had no idea what we should do .
He &apos;s a good man .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that you knew each other ?
You said so yourself .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
I don &apos;t have money .
I want to know the reason .
If you ever need a job , come see me .
He doesn &apos;t know yet .
Tom asked everyone questions .
I am going to play tennis .
This is my brother , Tom .
He is the only child they have .
What has become of him ?
I now know it &apos;s possible .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me about you .
I am short of money .
That wasn &apos;t a mistake .
They may not know anything about this .
She knows nothing about your family .
No one was at home .
I didn &apos;t forget you .
Tom still has to tell Mary what to do .
I &apos;m very happy in Boston .
I &apos;m going to bed early today .
We &apos;ve already done our work .
We don &apos;t speak French .
These things take time .
Who gave you that ?
I feel better than ever .
I don &apos;t understand that at all .
We &apos;re out of coffee .
I just want to be your friend , nothing more .
His name is known to everyone in this town .
I need to know before 2 : 30 .
Do it once again .
Tom took me for my brother .
We &apos;re not busy .
How do you feel about what she said ?
This work is anything but easy .
I love my cat .
I need some water .
Tom can sing quite well .
That doesn &apos;t happen very often .
Tom looks busy .
I always have time for you .
Maybe they can be happy .
Tom wants Mary to want him .
There &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
Tom , it doesn &apos;t work that way .
All we need is a little more time .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
Tom is one of my students .
Come alone .
This is for you , I think .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m ready .
I think Tom could learn a lot from you .
Tom was in Australia last month .
I just don &apos;t know what to do .
Where do you want to eat ?
I don &apos;t know what I should &apos;ve done .
We &apos;re out of tea .
Tom had a little money .
I got tired very fast .
That was the last time any of us ever saw Tom .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
I don &apos;t want Tom to do that .
He &apos;s working on it .
It &apos;s only me .
She was young .
I have a daughter .
It &apos;s very cold .
You look very good .
What kind of help do you need ?
This is the town where he was born .
You can have this .
We &apos;re happy .
Nobody saw Tom .
Tom and Mary became good friends .
Where is your friend from ?
Tom told Mary about his plan .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom .
Tom has a new girlfriend .
Where did you learn French ?
It &apos;s hard to believe that Tom really did that .
I can do that if you let me .
Tom is fine .
Is she here yet ?
I left Japan for the first time in ten years .
I can &apos;t understand Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with Mary .
Do you want to see this ?
She let him drive on his own .
I should go to Boston .
When did Tom say that ?
Does Tom have it ?
I believe it &apos;s finished .
Tom will never tell us the truth .
You &apos;re back .
She still loves him .
Where can we buy it ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
You should know that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
Tom was important to me .
We have enough food now .
How &apos;re you doing ?
Tom couldn &apos;t stop .
Tom shouldn &apos;t talk so much .
If I don &apos;t go , who will ?
She has three children .
We don &apos;t know what Tom said .
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
I know Tom &apos;s father .
Tom never came home .
We didn &apos;t find Tom .
We &apos;re a little early .
Tom said you &apos;re old friends .
He is thirty years old .
You &apos;re good at this .
I want to do this at home .
Don &apos;t say such a thing .
I &apos;d like to work with Tom .
I must be going now .
I think that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;d do .
I will try .
When do you want it ?
I &apos;m glad to see you .
I &apos;m not afraid at all .
I hope we find Tom .
It &apos;s good to have you home .
I want to see that again .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
You are good .
I know what &apos;s going on here .
Let &apos;s go out and eat dinner together from time to time .
If you really want to speak to me , it &apos;s now or never .
Tom may not want to do that .
You can &apos;t have this .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking .
I met him yesterday .
Do you want in on this ?
Tom has got it .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s book .
I don &apos;t know if I can come .
I think I &apos;m going to go now .
Tom can hear Mary very well .
He wanted to buy the book .
My English is not good at all .
What &apos;s it like being Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
How large is your family ?
Can you read ?
Tom is working on it .
What you do is up to you .
I can &apos;t tell you the answer to that yet .
Can you come tomorrow ?
I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow .
What about your wife ?
I &apos;m thinking about you .
Tom said he could give Mary some money .
How long is it ?
Tom &apos;s free .
Tom is never coming back .
Tom came into the room .
He has more books than I do .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
I wish I &apos;d been here three hours ago .
I think you should go and visit Tom .
I &apos;d like to be able to tell Tom that he has nothing to worry about .
You have done well .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
Do you know what day it is today ?
What is it you want ?
What are they ?
Are your parents in now ?
Maybe I should write Tom a letter .
I wish we had done that .
I would like some more water .
I have done what I could .
I should be at school .
Tom will be there .
I can hardly understand you .
I knew it .
I will go out when I have finished this work .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know your name .
Tom says he needs my help tomorrow .
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
Did you say you had a cat ?
I &apos;ve often heard Tom say that .
Why are you working for Tom ?
What &apos;s your problem ?
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
I surprised Tom .
Please let me try it again .
What could he mean ?
He said that you had better go .
I still love you very much .
Tom was sick .
I &apos;ll be waiting outside .
Tom is still afraid of Mary .
Tell me where she lives .
I don &apos;t love you .
Tom can &apos;t leave just yet .
I don &apos;t know what to think .
Tom isn &apos;t like you .
I was trying to help .
We &apos;re doing nothing .
She works for a hospital .
Do you have anything to eat ?
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school today .
I almost forgot to do my homework .
Tom is family .
Do you know who he is ?
She just told me .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be happy .
I don &apos;t want you to go home .
Do you really want to go back to Boston ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has a girlfriend .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
I do not love him any longer .
I &apos;ve always been here .
Tom knew that Mary was tired .
What are you eating ?
I would like to see my father .
He has no girlfriend .
It &apos;s a good movie .
Tom &apos;s making his bed .
I want Tom to see these .
You know what I want .
I can &apos;t get Tom to help me .
What &apos;s Tom doing here again ?
We think that &apos;s a good thing .
You don &apos;t look well .
Tom works at home .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
Do you have any idea who would do this ?
He has a large family .
Tom knows how to do this .
What they say is true .
I know this .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom wanted to learn .
I was in Boston yesterday .
I may never walk again .
Tom has many friends in Boston .
Tom is too old for Mary .
It &apos;s Monday , you know .
All of us speak French .
I have often been there .
How &apos;s the weather there ?
You &apos;ll do what you have to do .
They must be happy .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like Tom .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
I wonder what happened .
I couldn &apos;t stop .
I would like to see Tom .
She &apos;s only a child .
Tom has gone to Australia .
He told me that his father was a doctor .
Tom has to help Mary .
I hope that Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
Tom has to go home now .
I want to play , too .
We have nothing to left eat .
Nobody &apos;s there .
My father has been busy .
Let Tom drive .
Tom left me for another woman .
Do you really not remember me ?
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents about us ?
Can &apos;t this wait until tomorrow ?
Come home with me .
We &apos;ve been up all night .
I have to work tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t see it like that .
I have enough money to buy it .
She looked as if she had been sick for a long time .
They won &apos;t find it .
Where has Tom gone ?
Let &apos;s hit the town tonight and have some fun .
He will come .
I &apos;m ready now .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve felt this bad .
I don &apos;t know English .
Tom is very happy in Boston .
That &apos;s all you need .
You &apos;ve never been as busy as I am right now .
May I help you ?
I don &apos;t know anything about him .
What has the world come to ?
What &apos;s on ?
What is she like ?
I &apos;m too tired .
I have to show you something .
I found it on the street .
Don &apos;t leave me behind !
I want to tell Mary I love her .
She is not as beautiful as she was before .
Who are we ?
I &apos;m very surprised .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
He has no money .
What did Tom tell Mary to do ?
How many friends do you have ?
Is Tom finished eating ?
I should have told her that I love her .
I &apos;m a good person .
Who can that be ?
She is not afraid of anything .
Tom didn &apos;t get everything he wanted .
We will leave in an hour .
He went there to learn English .
Tom is good at French .
I &apos;d like you to help Tom .
I &apos;m coming , too .
Does anyone still have a question ?
Tom and Mary are there with John now .
Tom wants to know how long we &apos;re going to be here .
I just asked because I thought you would know .
Tom is going to stop by today .
It may be important .
Did you talk to your wife ?
I &apos;ve done it before .
You seemed to enjoy doing that .
Give me two minutes .
That is not exactly what I said .
How &apos;s everyone doing today ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know who I am .
I know all of them .
Tom wanted to see you .
This is a dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much money .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid to speak French .
Why does Tom want us to do this ?
What did you learn ?
Tom would be a good teacher .
Tom is doing that again .
I will be at home tomorrow .
No one knows what &apos;s going on .
I know what his name is .
Let &apos;s have a go at it .
Can we do that ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
You &apos;ll see it .
Nobody does that .
You don &apos;t have to be alone anymore .
He took his book .
Tom wants what Mary has .
She kept him waiting for a long time .
I thought Tom was in Australia .
I hope to see my parents tomorrow .
I like it when Tom does that .
You &apos;re not eating very much . What &apos;s wrong ?
Where do you see the books ?
Where do they do that ?
Tom didn &apos;t even know where he was .
That &apos;s a good school .
We &apos;re not coming .
Tom knows the city very well .
Everyone felt sorry for Tom .
Tom is a friend of the family .
Tom is not my son .
You and I are good friends .
You don &apos;t have the time .
He doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
Tom has a girlfriend .
What did you wear ?
Did Tom eat dinner ?
Tom likes playing with my dog .
Is that all we need ?
I think they like me .
She couldn &apos;t understand what had happened there .
Tom told me everything .
I knew it was Tom .
The night is still young .
Tom and Mary told John .
Tom hasn &apos;t found Mary yet .
I thought Tom would like to know .
The story was true .
We know where it is .
I &apos;ll come by car .
I thought you might want it .
I wonder what time it is .
I want to know about Tom .
I &apos;d like to study with you tonight , but I can &apos;t .
This isn &apos;t the first time this has happened to me .
Let me see .
How big is your house ?
How far is it from here ?
The child fell out of bed .
He no longer works here .
Tom gets along well with Mary .
Do you know where I can find it ?
I had help .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his family .
Tom almost never makes a mistake .
I can &apos;t eat all that by myself .
Tom isn &apos;t here . He &apos;s already left .
Can I get a little help , please ?
Can you tell me why we need to do this ?
I would like to do something else today .
I love my home .
Tom is your brother , isn &apos;t he ?
Is this car yours ?
That &apos;s his .
Did Tom like Boston ?
You can &apos;t have both .
I would like to be alone .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
Who will do it ?
We need more .
I have read the book .
She knows where we live .
I &apos;ve been better .
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow .
We &apos;d like that .
She &apos;s at the hotel now .
We &apos;re quite tired .
Tom is back .
You haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
Could you do it ?
Why does Tom know that ?
Is that what you said ?
I spent the whole day thinking about Tom .
I really don &apos;t need any help .
What do you expect from us ?
Tom &apos;s girlfriend saw him with another girl .
Tom is at school now .
Do you want a little cake ?
I &apos;m rich .
My brother likes music .
I bought it .
Did you tell Tom when to come ?
I had fun doing this .
Why &apos;s that important ?
I didn &apos;t write this letter .
I haven &apos;t finished my homework yet .
Where can I meet Tom ?
We have a few questions for you .
If only I could speak English !
What was that ?
I &apos;ve always wanted a child .
I think Tom is pretty angry .
What was your mother doing when you got home ?
He is sick .
We &apos;ve got a problem .
I &apos;ll come visit you tomorrow .
I want you to go home .
Tom gave Mary three dollars and John thirty dollars .
Tom says Mary is happy .
The game isn &apos;t over yet .
I &apos;m able to speak .
I bought a new car .
Would you like some coffee or something ?
I know what Tom does here .
No one is coming with me .
They &apos;ve been out there a long time .
I don &apos;t really remember all that much about what happened .
It looked like Tom wanted to say more , but he didn &apos;t .
That has always been so .
I still haven &apos;t found Tom .
That girl looks like a boy .
Tom knows it .
Is your child a boy or a girl ?
Tom says he &apos;s not happy .
I &apos;m getting by .
Tom saw where Mary lives .
Tom didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
I &apos;m very busy now .
Tom has come .
They don &apos;t talk to us anymore .
He has a car .
Are those Tom &apos;s shoes ?
That was the first time I was ever alone with Tom .
Did they say what happened ?
Have you finished yet ?
I can &apos;t understand this at all .
I can &apos;t believe I didn &apos;t even think of that .
This is the house where I was born .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
I want you to have this .
The train is very fast .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Do you know if Tom can speak French ?
What would you have done in my place ?
How did all this come about ?
He must be Tom &apos;s brother .
It &apos;s my book .
You look like your mother .
No one knew that .
Can we get this over with , please ?
Where are your parents ?
Tom wants us to think he &apos;s happy .
You don &apos;t understand me .
This is no good .
This book is hard for me to read .
That doesn &apos;t happen often .
If only I could drive a car .
I did what had to be done .
It is a book .
I wish I had this problem .
Do you wish to go ?
I &apos;ll sleep here .
It &apos;s just one of those things .
I hope to hear from you .
Tom doesn &apos;t look rich to me .
It &apos;s not that cold .
Tom said that he was very busy .
Do you really want to know ?
Tom might get sick .
What did he say ?
I &apos;m doing it for you .
Tom seemed to know the truth .
We know you &apos;re in here .
Tom says he saw Mary .
Why is Tom so good at French ?
Is it really true ?
I don &apos;t like this .
Tom never told me what happened .
Tom can &apos;t sleep .
Tom is doing fine in school .
No one knows why .
Don &apos;t be late to school again .
&quot; Where is her book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
You are a good person .
You &apos;ll see it again .
We &apos;re working on it .
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat .
She can &apos;t drive a car .
It &apos;s only a matter of time .
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know .
I don &apos;t ever want to do this again .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
Tom would never do such a thing .
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Boston .
If you want , I can show you how to do that .
He loves her .
Tom is a good friend .
I left the house .
Tom is no longer my friend .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be early .
It doesn &apos;t matter much .
Nobody knows me in Boston .
Mary is a good mother .
Tom is with Mary .
Do you want Tom there ?
Do you want to end up like Tom ?
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday .
Tom has a girl back home .
Can &apos;t anything be done ?
Who &apos;s that boy ?
You know better .
My mother is beautiful .
He has another son .
Tom and Mary did their homework together .
It should be like this .
I &apos;m glad we agree .
He didn &apos;t tell me everything .
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s going on .
Tom is going to like those .
This is the book that I told you about .
Tom wasn &apos;t very sick .
It doesn &apos;t matter now .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else we have to do ?
I don &apos;t have to be here .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
I saw something .
This is what I want .
Tom went there to meet Mary .
What time is it ?
I &apos;ll never work for you .
Is that boy Tom ?
They &apos;re waiting for you .
Don &apos;t you ever let me hear you talking to your mother like that again .
Tom and Mary think I don &apos;t know .
Can you show us the house ?
I know about Tom .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s friend .
What are Tom and Mary doing here ?
They do know what they &apos;re doing .
Can I try it ?
This is my brother &apos;s .
I thought doing this would be easy .
That &apos;s not what Tom says .
What else did you do together ?
Give me back the book after you have read it .
Tom wasn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom , I &apos;m here .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
I have read this book before .
Tom told the truth .
I didn &apos;t go to school last Monday .
Tom is eating dinner now .
That &apos;s what you have to do .
Where can I buy it ?
I know almost nothing about it .
Why do you have to do that ?
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Tom looked very good .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
He cannot have been there yesterday .
When do you need it ?
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that has happened .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I &apos;ll be back late .
Who did what ?
Tom is going to like being here .
I &apos;m not having a good day .
Is it really all over ?
You have to believe me .
What did you do exactly ?
That made me think of you .
How are you all ?
I wonder if he &apos;s at home .
This must be my book .
Tom knows why Mary is in Boston .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
If Tom is right , Mary is in Boston now .
She is out now .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with me .
Why do we have to go home ?
That &apos;s not how I want things to be .
Are you busy ?
We &apos;ve been here for a while .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is .
Tom loves what he does .
If you have questions , ask away .
Can &apos;t you stay a little longer ?
Do it again !
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t speak to you .
I will make a man of you .
I love money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened .
We &apos;ll see you when you get home .
Tom has a new woman in his life .
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
My father does not like music .
I only know that Tom isn &apos;t happy .
What is it , Tom ? What &apos;s wrong ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have an office .
I didn &apos;t like being kept waiting so long .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you .
I have more than one friend who can &apos;t swim .
Can you still remember when we first met ?
Please come here .
Tom isn &apos;t as tired as Mary .
I only hope that that is enough .
I only have one friend left .
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to find me .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I like you a lot .
Nobody ever found her cat .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom saw me .
I have to go . It &apos;s getting late .
This is too short .
I &apos;ll never do it again .
Tom has a new car .
I want to understand Tom .
Is it too big ?
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
When you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
I have to have that .
You need to get ready .
We both know that .
Let &apos;s just be friends .
Tom came home very late .
What &apos;ll you have ?
I think Tom knows .
I can &apos;t believe Tom told you .
What happened to my car ?
We won &apos;t need your help today .
I &apos;ll be with you .
We want to see Tom do that .
Tom , this is my brother , John .
I think about him often .
Tom said he was afraid .
I &apos;ll go and ask Tom .
It &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
I don &apos;t see a problem with it .
Please eat some cake .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else to eat ?
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Nobody &apos;s seen Tom .
You should learn French .
Tom asked Mary not to leave .
I &apos;ve been able to read since I was six years old .
What Tom has told you is true .
This month was kind of difficult .
Tom bought a new car .
You should never have done that .
He went out of the room .
Tom is looking at us .
When &apos;s Tom coming home ?
I wish I had done more .
We can meet next week if you want .
Do you want to leave now ?
I love going to school here .
I don &apos;t have the time for this .
I don &apos;t want to know .
Is there something I could get you ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t come .
Tom was told to go home .
Tom looks like he always does .
I want an answer from you as soon as possible .
There were a lot of people at the party .
You &apos;re not going to make me drink alone , are you ?
There &apos;s no one by that name here .
What is it you want from me ?
He looks happy .
I think it &apos;d be fun .
Tom said you &apos;d come .
Tom asked Mary for help .
I want to do it .
They saw us yesterday .
Did Tom go ?
That &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t know .
I must tell you something .
Why don &apos;t we get going ?
Tom wants to talk to all of us .
Tom has been living in Boston for almost ten years .
It is hardly possible for him not to make any mistake .
You &apos;ve done that already .
It &apos;s great to be here .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s true .
I know what you want .
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
I think you &apos;re going to like this movie .
I forgot it .
I &apos;m not happy here .
Tom speaks French as well as you .
Tom , Mary and John are all here .
Tom hardly ever works anymore .
You &apos;re looking tired .
I cannot help you .
What &apos;s this doing here ?
I &apos;m still young .
Tom walked into the room .
She needs to sleep more .
What do you want to watch ?
Please let me sleep .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
She has many friends .
I have a problem with my car .
Tom had nothing .
I don &apos;t know because I wasn &apos;t there .
He gets up early .
Tom says he wants to study French .
Is that your new girlfriend ?
I like that .
I went home because it was late .
This is going to be fine .
Tom has a big dog .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it .
I think that Tom knows Mary .
Tom knows we &apos;re here .
I need this money .
Tom never told me about this .
I have a very good opinion of Tom .
Do you remember what you said to me ?
He does not get up early .
He didn &apos;t do any work .
We are going to have a baby .
Do you want to drink tea or coffee ?
Tom is a good person .
I think he likes me .
I like it here .
Tom hardly said a word all day .
I &apos;ll try .
I have to go back to work .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I &apos;m all for that .
Tom says Mary isn &apos;t happy .
I think Tom should see this .
I think Tom knows already .
Why do they do that ?
What &apos;s Tom going to do ?
Is one of you Tom ?
I bought the book yesterday .
Tom made himself something to eat .
I &apos;m already busy .
Is that possible ?
Is it really you ?
It was where Tom said it would be .
I seem to have done something wrong .
What can &apos;t you do ?
I think you went too far .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
Tom made us do the work .
Can I come to your office tomorrow ?
It &apos;s not Tom .
No one goes there anymore .
Tom ran out of money .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want me to drive you home ?
What do you think it is ?
They found each other .
Don &apos;t let him do it alone .
Give him time .
How old is Tom ?
Can she come , too ?
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
The train has not arrived yet .
Tom was looking at you .
These are mine .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t coming .
We want our money back .
Did Tom talk to you ?
I &apos;ll show you how to do it .
I don &apos;t have that much money .
There will be no school a week from today .
I want to do it for you .
I still have a lot to learn .
I read about that .
I &apos;m not getting this .
I will not let you do it .
I &apos;m surprised Tom didn &apos;t show .
Tom has bought a new car .
It is pretty cold today .
She was on her way to school .
How does Tom come to school ?
What are you two up to ?
You can &apos;t help Tom .
I don &apos;t know the way .
It &apos;s not up to you .
I &apos;m not sure I want that .
I don &apos;t think everyone is here yet .
Tom is coming back .
I need new shoes .
We &apos;re friends .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom .
I know what we need to do .
How long does it take to go to the office from your home ?
I said nothing .
Tell Tom why you &apos;re here .
You shouldn &apos;t try to do everything by yourself .
I &apos;ve had enough of Tom and Mary .
I hope so .
I wonder if Tom found something .
You &apos;ve got to help me learn to drive .
We should probably go home .
How is the weather in Boston ?
I don &apos;t know what his name is .
They &apos;re able to sing .
Tom really wants to help .
You always have to have the last word , don &apos;t you ?
I know what Tom saw .
Why aren &apos;t you going after Tom ?
I &apos;ve eaten enough .
I saw it from the window .
Tom , are all these books yours ?
When do you think you &apos;ll see Tom ?
I want to know what &apos;s going on here .
I &apos;m going to turn in early tonight .
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston .
I can do it by myself .
I bought the book for myself , not for my wife .
Tom sat looking out of the window .
We didn &apos;t even get that far .
Tom wasn &apos;t ready , but Mary was .
Tom is much better today than he was yesterday .
What I want is to go home .
They didn &apos;t have enough money .
I had no idea that Tom knew how to speak French .
Tom likes to play tennis , too .
She is not a good person .
Tom made a mistake .
Mary just got her hair done .
What &apos;s going on ?
I think I &apos;m ready .
Tom had other things he needed to buy .
This is on you .
Tom hasn &apos;t read this book yet .
I do not think that he will come .
He asked for money .
If you don &apos;t believe me , go and see for yourself .
Can I go ?
I &apos;d like to go , too .
Are we all ready ?
You &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom needs work .
This money is mine .
This is wrong .
I am busy today .
Nobody was home .
I want to study French .
Tom forgot to write to Mary .
Tom seemed lost .
I only know what I &apos;ve been told .
I want to be happy again .
My book is here .
This is my job .
Who was it ?
I &apos;ve thought of that .
What have you told them ?
Tom really doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary where he was .
If I had enough money , I could buy this book .
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
I &apos;ll stay with you until Tom gets here .
How long is too long ?
What am I going to say ?
It &apos;s Tom .
Tom already knows what Mary wants to do .
Tom and Mary are doing fine .
I think I &apos;ve been here before .
I have finished my homework .
Please help Tom .
I &apos;ll be back in two hours .
How often do you see her ?
They want something from us , but I don &apos;t know what .
You &apos;re tired , aren &apos;t you ? Why don &apos;t you get to bed ?
The party &apos;s over .
Tom could do this .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me ?
She &apos;s a good person .
There is no reason why I should help him .
Where &apos;s the doctor ?
I won &apos;t be back for a while .
Tom hasn &apos;t been sick in a long time .
I don &apos;t see your name on it .
Tom has to come with me .
Are you with us ?
I sure wish I could speak French better .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
Is that what you &apos;d like ?
How is this possible ?
He &apos;s rich .
Are you in ?
Tom still has many things to do .
They know something we don &apos;t .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Do you have children ?
Who wrote this book ?
Tom isn &apos;t one of us .
I &apos;ve never heard of such a thing .
Your daughter is not a child anymore .
Tell it to him , not me !
I went to that party .
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to finish her homework so quickly .
You don &apos;t want to talk about it at all , do you ?
Why do you want that ?
Why don &apos;t we take Tom there ?
Let &apos;s talk about your job .
What will we be doing this time next week ?
I wish I had a dog .
I didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
I &apos;m going to write Tom a letter .
Is his story true ?
We have no idea how it happened .
It was the truth .
When does the train leave for Boston ?
I &apos;ve got more books than I can read .
When do you leave for school ?
That &apos;s the way he likes it .
I gave Mary a book .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at work .
I can see it in your eyes .
I know them all .
It &apos;s not what we want .
We &apos;ll be happy to help .
I can &apos;t ever go back there again .
You know who Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
We were very busy last week .
I &apos;ve got the money .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
I &apos;ll be in my office all afternoon .
There was only one problem .
He &apos;s still at work .
I &apos;d like to see your father .
You &apos;re going to like working for me .
It is difficult for me .
I &apos;ve said too much already .
How is your father ?
Tom knows Mary better than I do .
Why do you have to go ?
That was so much fun .
Tom asked why .
I think the train will come soon .
Tom knows us well .
How do you think Tom is doing ?
It &apos;s cold out there .
I hope no one saw you .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting married .
That &apos;s a good idea .
How are you doing , Tom ?
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I should just tell Tom the truth .
We learn to read and write in school .
This is all you have to do now .
I wish I could live in Boston .
Can &apos;t they speak French ?
Tom wanted to study with Mary .
He can &apos;t do it .
She didn &apos;t say a word .
She told me everything .
Where &apos;s my son ?
You look very tired .
I thought I saw someone I knew .
I don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;d better not tell him .
We don &apos;t want that .
How come you know English so well ?
I wish you had told me that .
I &apos;m sure Tom will understand .
I want to know where it is .
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
Maybe I don &apos;t want to know .
Tom and Mary just don &apos;t hit it off .
I should &apos;ve told Tom .
You don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom made a lot of mistakes .
How far is it from here to your house ?
I know someone who lives in Boston .
Where is the cat ?
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
She must have been very beautiful .
I like being with Tom .
Tom is much better than you .
Tom isn &apos;t done .
Tom wasn &apos;t too tired to study .
Could you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
Your dog is here .
What do you want for that ?
He got angry .
Tom thought only of Mary .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t from Boston ?
I have something else I need you to do .
Where are our children ?
He is still here .
They want this .
You are my mother .
No one would talk about it .
How many students are there in your school ?
He &apos;s a good person .
Let &apos;s ask the teacher .
I know why Tom is doing that .
Why are we here ?
I don &apos;t know what this is .
Tom &apos;s French isn &apos;t very good .
I &apos;ve got money .
Please stop it .
Tom always had a lot of money .
Tom likes to do that .
Do you know how to do it ?
What &apos;s Tom doing there ?
Have you done all your homework ?
Tom is always short of money .
Tom would tell us the truth , wouldn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
It won &apos;t last long .
When did you go there ?
Tom seems tired .
You don &apos;t have to be afraid .
Tom wants us to go with him .
It might be important .
You are rich .
Do you want to do it again ?
We don &apos;t know where Tom is .
What &apos;s Tom still doing here ?
She didn &apos;t read the book .
Tom saw Mary coming .
I &apos;m happy to hear it .
Tom wanted to have another baby , but his wife didn &apos;t .
They &apos;re like family .
You can &apos;t go back there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
Are we ready for it ?
Tom just sat there saying nothing .
No one really knows .
Tom likes tea .
It &apos;s not as cold today as it was yesterday .
I believe it to be true .
I want to see more .
Tom ate alone .
What was the weather like ?
What do you need ?
Tom isn &apos;t working .
It was very cold this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
I know what people want .
I &apos;ll give it to you .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school here anymore .
I &apos;m not going to school today .
He asked his teacher for advice .
Tom asked the teacher some questions .
She did not read the book .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
What do you think of these shoes ?
My father isn &apos;t home yet .
He looked young .
All the students look up to him .
Tom is as old as I am .
She bought him a car .
Do you remember what you said ?
Tom never forgot .
We need a car .
We need more people like you .
Tom , I want to talk to you .
Tom and Mary are both thirty .
Tom should be in bed .
We found one .
This is where Tom wants to live .
How can I get to the train station ?
I had so much fun doing that .
I don &apos;t know a thing about her .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
What more do you need ?
I &apos;m always busy with my homework .
Are you my father ?
I should &apos;ve known Tom would be here , too .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
Tom knows that &apos;s no good .
Tom said he only needed a few more minutes .
How &apos;s it coming , Tom ?
They can understand me .
Tom isn &apos;t finished yet .
I think it &apos;s time to do my homework .
I like to make people happy .
What do you want to hear ?
Tom is busy now .
Come home early .
I wish I had time for a girlfriend .
Tom &apos;s car is gone .
Her father died .
I do like you .
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
How is your family ?
Tom will never believe that .
You know almost everything about me .
When I &apos;ve finished my homework , I &apos;ll go for a swim .
Tom and I are the same age .
You should tell the truth .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car .
Don &apos;t give up on me .
Do you want to do that ?
What &apos;s wrong with this plan ?
These shoes are too big for me .
She has already finished the work .
I knew you &apos;d find me .
No one is going to know .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
I thought Tom would never stop talking .
I don &apos;t want to drive .
Nobody lives in this house .
I &apos;m sure Tom is fine .
He might not be happy .
Tom has just told me that he found a new job .
Tom can &apos;t do it .
You have to come with us .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything all day .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that because he doesn &apos;t think he needs to .
This bicycle is mine .
It wasn &apos;t until this morning that Tom told me that .
We &apos;ve got enough .
Tom didn &apos;t like my idea .
When she was young , she was very beautiful .
The good news is that we don &apos;t have to go .
Do you want to see it again ?
We are young .
I hope I haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
Tom didn &apos;t want to help us today .
Tom has no children .
Don &apos;t drink the water .
My family is very important to me .
I thought he might come .
I &apos;ll never go out with Tom again .
This doesn &apos;t mean a thing to me .
Tom isn &apos;t the same age as Mary .
What is the story ?
That &apos;s because you &apos;re a girl .
When are you going to do that ?
How can you say something like that ?
I didn &apos;t go to school .
Tom is back in town .
Your time is over .
He said that he would be back soon .
He doesn &apos;t love his girlfriend .
We don &apos;t have that kind of money .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Why do you think ?
You must tell us .
I think that he is right .
Tom &apos;s family is in Boston .
I think Tom already knows .
Tom almost looks like a girl .
They are eating just now .
I don &apos;t have a brother .
We &apos;ll see .
How was today &apos;s game ?
He was busy with his homework .
Tom has been there for three years .
We &apos;re not going to Boston .
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
I &apos;ll stay .
Have you read Tom &apos;s new book ?
I was just talking to Tom .
Is now a good time to talk to Tom ?
The money is on the table .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
He was like a father to me .
Tom was in the house .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
I didn &apos;t see that .
I think I had better not say anything about it .
I thought I saw something .
I want to go to bed .
I think we can be friends .
Tom came on Monday .
Please don &apos;t go .
I can &apos;t sleep .
Why do I have to go ?
Give me that one .
How &apos;s Tom going to do it ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
You know where Tom is .
Do you have much money with you ?
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to let Tom sing .
Tom never talked about it much .
She doesn &apos;t always come late .
Tom wants to be a doctor .
They won &apos;t believe me .
The movie was almost three hours long .
I think this is yours .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where .
I want Tom to go home .
They say that he was in the hospital at that time .
I have just finished my work .
Tom is no longer afraid .
Tom could hear Mary , but he couldn &apos;t see her .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me three hours ago ?
Where do you come from ?
I just wanted to see what it was like .
What am I going to say to Tom ?
You &apos;ve got to let me go .
Who are your parents ?
It &apos;s too easy .
We have to stop it .
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
No way !
I &apos;m not your daughter .
I have a cat and a dog .
Did they come today ?
That doesn &apos;t mean anything .
Tom &apos;ll go .
That was only a year ago .
You &apos;re a little too young for me .
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
I don &apos;t think your mother will like it .
Tom just wants to have fun .
Tom wanted to be there .
Nobody likes her .
I &apos;m a student .
Is the door open ?
Could we talk about last night ?
I &apos;m glad I was able to meet you yesterday .
I &apos;ve never heard of him before .
I &apos;d like to see what you have in your hand .
My father bought a new car .
Would you like to see Tom ?
It looks good .
How do you like Boston ?
Tom still hasn &apos;t come back .
I &apos;m happy with it .
Let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
Tom should have married Mary .
Tom gave Mary a watch .
Tom is easy to talk to .
What do you like the most about Tom ?
We &apos;ve got everything we need .
I see the book .
I know you want to be happy .
Tom said he &apos;d come .
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
Who is she ?
I &apos;ve got long hair .
I already told you that .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
He wants to go .
I &apos;ve got more money than Tom has .
Are you still here ?
Everyone &apos;s sick .
Tom wanted to go to Australia .
It was nice talking to you .
Nobody asked .
Do you not want me here ?
Is she at home ?
It was your mistake , not mine .
I &apos;ve never been this busy before .
I have a son who &apos;s just turned three .
I don &apos;t even know your name .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom looks very tired .
Why is the dog here ?
I love you the way you are .
Are you at Tom &apos;s place ?
I &apos;ll be taking the car .
I will never have a son .
There &apos;s something I need to show you .
You might have to do this all by yourself .
I &apos;ll go if the weather &apos;s good .
It was here that I saw her .
Tom might have to study French .
I think I know where Tom is .
Who has it now ?
She had no idea what I said .
Tom had no money left .
We &apos;ve been there before .
There &apos;s a dog by the door .
I never thought I &apos;d say this .
How was the weather yesterday ?
Do you have my book ?
They found something .
I let the cat out of the house .
We have finished the work for today .
Why are people afraid of Tom ?
He doesn &apos;t have a sister .
Did you speak French yesterday ?
How old is your father ?
Tom is your son , not mine .
I wish I were in Boston .
Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow .
I found some money .
I thought you &apos;d want to know .
Tom says Boston is really cold now .
I met him yesterday for the first time .
I have everything here that I need .
I know how that goes .
Let go of Tom .
This book is too difficult for me to understand .
We &apos;re still young .
I know how happy you are .
I will not do it again .
What &apos;s your mother &apos;s name ?
I know what you &apos;re probably thinking .
I &apos;m old .
I don &apos;t know how you do that .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to be happy ?
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
I never thought anything of it .
I &apos;m not your friend .
I love him .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
Tom can &apos;t buy himself a car .
Let it be .
I want to ask you something .
Can you come with me now ?
She lost both her parents .
I can wait no longer .
No one can help us .
We can &apos;t find Tom .
He asked after you .
Where did the other one go ?
We &apos;ve done nothing .
Tom was a good man .
I think you should do it .
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
I &apos;m sorry that I haven &apos;t been able to be here for you like I should have been .
I must find it .
They know how to swim .
You must be from Australia .
You may go .
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston .
Tom left yesterday right after you did .
Tom wants to go to Japan .
Tom &apos;s house is easy to find .
I know French .
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
Nobody saw it coming .
When did he come here ?
Tom wanted to live in Boston .
I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s quite true .
Tom will do that , I &apos;m pretty sure .
Tom doesn &apos;t know he shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
I may be able to help you .
I want a girlfriend .
I &apos;d like to know what your opinion is .
Don &apos;t you want to come with us ?
I want that car .
I have been here for two years .
I &apos;m not rich .
That &apos;s easy to say , but it &apos;s not easy to do .
Does Tom still remember me ?
Can I go home now ?
We &apos;re not going to do it .
Tom told me that everything was ready .
Where is my son ?
Tom will find Mary .
Where are we exactly ?
I thought it was really good .
Tom &apos;s very , very good .
How &apos;s your boy doing ?
We &apos;re here to help .
She goes to school .
They should know it .
How &apos;s my wife doing ?
He couldn &apos;t do such a thing .
Who found her ?
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
That &apos;ll make me happy .
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston .
What ? What did you say ?
You can &apos;t say I didn &apos;t try .
Tom will tell you the truth .
I can &apos;t live without him .
I don &apos;t know much about Boston .
Tom did what he was told .
Please don &apos;t ask .
Tom and Mary are waiting for the bus .
I thought I heard you .
Tom looked around the room , but he didn &apos;t see Mary .
He came .
They wouldn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He loves us .
Tom ate dinner .
Could you show me the way to the train station ?
I think Tom did this .
I don &apos;t want it .
I &apos;ll tell you what I want you to do .
Why is Tom in the hospital ?
We have one for you , too .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom &apos;s around at the moment .
That &apos;s me .
I &apos;m not going to go with you .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
I have to try .
I &apos;m not worried about him .
I didn &apos;t speak for long .
Is my French really so bad ?
She is always trying new things .
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
Tom lost his parents when he was young .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us ?
How do you like my new hat ?
It &apos;s all Tom &apos;s .
This is how Tom does it .
Tom says he knows you .
We &apos;ve already talked about this .
I lost everything I had .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
All are present .
Tom has known Mary for a long time .
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here .
Who is he and what &apos;s his name ?
What is it that we have to do ?
He was not sure what to do .
It makes me so angry .
She is nothing but a child .
How sick is Tom ?
Is there anything Tom can &apos;t do ?
I &apos;m going to take this .
Tom does what he wants .
I &apos;m like Tom .
All Tom can think about is Mary .
There &apos;s got to be a way .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
She wanted to understand .
That &apos;s what I want from you .
What can you give me ?
I won &apos;t be ready .
Tom can play tennis very well .
I know what Tom is doing .
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
I &apos;m going out with Tom .
What does Tom know ?
That &apos;s the way it is .
It won &apos;t be easy .
Tom goes to work by bus .
I &apos;ll do it with you .
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
I went to sleep .
You must go to bed now .
We shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home yesterday .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother .
I don &apos;t want to ever speak to you again .
Do they have money ?
What happened to you yesterday ?
Everyone knows it &apos;s true .
You should &apos;ve stayed in the hospital .
Tom was a good father .
He asked me to wait there until he came back .
Do you remember who told you that ?
What was the problem ?
You aren &apos;t any better than me .
I didn &apos;t think Tom was in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do that .
Everyone is ready .
I can &apos;t do it .
Tom did that .
Do you have any money ?
I want to see you in my office .
That &apos;s not so important .
We all know that Tom didn &apos;t do that .
Who &apos;s he ?
I &apos;ve never felt so happy in my life .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it happened .
Don &apos;t you have anything else ?
I have something to say to you .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to do .
Thank you for being there .
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
We had some questions .
He ran out of money .
I want you .
You speak French , right ?
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
It &apos;s very big .
It &apos;s time to get down to business .
I &apos;ll be in Boston .
I &apos;m pretty sure it was Tom that I saw .
I don &apos;t know if Tom works there or not .
Is this Tom ?
What do you mean by that ?
Tom and Mary are very happy .
Tom told her .
You &apos;re a good mother .
Why don &apos;t you go and see ?
Everyone wants what they can &apos;t have .
I only need two more minutes .
I &apos;ve never had to do anything like this before .
I can &apos;t look at this anymore .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom know that ?
I really thought Tom was happy .
How many times have you been there ?
Tom saw me do that .
You &apos;re looking good !
Tom will like that .
Is this yours , Tom ?
It has to stop .
Tom is out there .
Let &apos;s eat .
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
I &apos;ll be back at six .
They &apos;re angry .
Do you know what that is ?
Tom is coming home .
We &apos;re doing it the right way .
I like coming to Boston .
How many years have you been studying French ?
Did you find anything else ?
I love you more than anyone else .
Tom speaks quickly .
I think you &apos;d better leave now .
Tom knows he should do it , but he doesn &apos;t want to .
Please call me Tom .
Tom asked me if I was happy .
Tom took his own life .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Tom began to talk .
It was very cold .
We saw it .
You have to come with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle .
How old are your children now ?
Are they busy ?
I don &apos;t know who it is .
Tom is in Boston with his parents .
I know why he did it .
How many people work here ?
We &apos;d better wait until tomorrow .
He wanted to meet you .
If anyone comes to see me , say that I went out .
Tom looks like he &apos;s a bit tired .
Everyone is waiting for Tom to say something .
I wish I could help you .
Tom thought he would be late .
It &apos;s me !
Tom is here already .
We walked here .
Tom will come .
Tom needs you .
That is all that he said .
You should ask Tom yourself .
Who was here ?
I &apos;ve never been to that town .
Tom found Mary , didn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s what we do .
Tom thought that Mary was busy .
It isn &apos;t a hospital .
You know where I &apos;ll be .
I never said that it wasn &apos;t a good idea .
You &apos;ve got time right now , don &apos;t you ?
They want Tom .
This has never been tried before .
Do you have a big family ?
Tom said he never saw Mary .
What do you have on for tomorrow night ?
Nobody knows my country .
I can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary have been together for ten years .
Tom doesn &apos;t make many mistakes .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;ll come .
Tom is going to do it .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
Tom is trying to learn French .
We know about that .
I haven &apos;t heard that word in a long time .
They don &apos;t want us here .
I have to be here all night .
I &apos;m not so sure now .
You should always keep your word .
This is my mother .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston longer .
How good was Tom today ?
You can &apos;t go home now .
I &apos;m not coming with you .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
My work is very important .
I &apos;ll try to say it in French .
Tom said you would understand .
I &apos;ll come by .
Let &apos;s get married .
Are we just friends ?
I went to the park this morning .
Do you want to try ?
I think we &apos;re ready .
That &apos;s my mother .
I lost the watch .
The boy came back .
I should &apos;ve been there with you .
The boy made his parents happy .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell you anything .
I have seen enough .
It is a good idea to read this book .
What did you do ?
Tom knows what Mary did .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s car ?
Are you saying that you don &apos;t have enough money ?
That doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
She wouldn &apos;t speak to him .
She loves children .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my family .
Tom gave us nothing .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has a bicycle or not .
Tom wanted to buy it .
Tom had no money .
I wish I had a friend like you .
I asked Tom not to tell Mary .
It wasn &apos;t a party .
This isn &apos;t for you .
We need to know what &apos;s going on .
There must be another way .
I asked Tom to help .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
No matter who says so , I can &apos;t believe that .
I need to be sure .
It &apos;s now time to leave .
The cat is under the bed .
No matter how busy you are , you have to do your homework .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go to bed .
Tom has to come .
Tom won &apos;t know the answer to that .
Do you want to tell me what this is ?
I &apos;m just trying to help .
I saw that coming .
I must catch the first train .
I like what I see .
It &apos;s all mine .
That would really make me happy .
I love them .
I know it &apos;s bad .
We &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
I thought you said Tom would be asleep .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
You shouldn &apos;t do his work .
I know it very well .
Are they all the same ?
That &apos;s too good to be true .
Can I ask why not ?
I &apos;m sorry about this .
It &apos;s going to be hard to do that without a lot of help .
I have nothing to do with them .
Tom quickly closed the door .
I think you &apos;d like it there .
He comes to visit us every now and then .
I think Tom might like that .
I have something to say .
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Tom said to ask you .
I &apos;ll do what must be done .
Tom is done .
Tom may do that with Mary .
You are the one .
I only have three dollars on me .
This book isn &apos;t as easy as that one .
Tom would know .
Tom came to visit us .
Tell me what I need to know .
Tom came into my room .
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you sick ?
You had no reason to do that .
I want to work at a hospital .
Tom tried to get Mary to help John .
I cannot find time to read the book .
We &apos;re afraid .
What does Tom want from us ?
Maybe Tom shouldn &apos;t be here .
Tom knows Mary pretty well .
I think my parents know .
Tom is very old .
Where should we meet ?
Don &apos;t say a word .
Did you watch this movie ?
I won &apos;t make that mistake again .
I have the house all to myself .
I have a dog .
We can &apos;t help Tom .
Tom will probably come .
I &apos;m glad it makes you happy .
I think we need to go back to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to do that .
I &apos;d love to get one of those .
I had to stay home .
I don &apos;t want to talk about the weather .
I told her that she was right .
I &apos;d just like to talk .
I only just met Tom .
I plan to stay in the city .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia yet .
They &apos;re all good .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how it happened .
What if I &apos;m right ?
You need friends .
I can &apos;t remember exactly where Tom lives .
This school has many students .
I know you &apos;re happy about that .
I saw that .
You didn &apos;t have to come so early .
He &apos;s a teacher and so am I .
I &apos;ll show you around the city .
Tom got a new job .
They want to go home .
Tom bought a car .
We must try again .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
Did you like Boston ?
Tom has a son .
These must be Tom &apos;s .
I think it &apos;s too early to tell .
Tom and I hardly ever see each other anymore .
She is in her hotel now .
We really don &apos;t have time .
He has no bicycle .
I saw her swim .
One can always find time .
This is all wrong .
I saw what I saw .
Tom wants to see you in his office .
She looks like a boy .
Is that for me ?
Let &apos;s see if Tom knows more than we do .
I &apos;m so happy .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , but Mary is .
You &apos;re not going to believe this .
We have a big dog .
I am sorry for you .
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible .
Why are you with me ?
Tom took the job .
This isn &apos;t about you .
This book is too difficult for me to read .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
There &apos;s still time .
You &apos;re better than I am .
This is the last train .
Tom wanted to write something .
Tom is trying to help you .
This book is not as easy as that one .
I think Tom knew .
Have you seen her ?
Maybe Tom can tell you what needs to be done .
I can get it from Tom .
If anyone can do it , you can .
Tom looked pretty tired .
That &apos;s up to you .
He doesn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I don &apos;t know how Tom does it .
I don &apos;t know why people do that .
They &apos;re just doing their job .
Why &apos;s Tom here and not Mary ?
I &apos;m a father .
Let me help you with your work .
She &apos;s too young to get married .
There &apos;s something I need to say to you .
I did not expect it to be that big .
Tom is your teacher .
I &apos;ll make some coffee .
Tell us who you are .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s all true .
I would never say that .
No one lives in this house anymore .
Why should I be afraid of Tom ?
That &apos;s not going to be easy .
I &apos;ll go to Boston to be with family .
What &apos;s Tom wearing ?
I want a book to read .
I saw it , too .
She likes the teacher .
The beer &apos;s very cold .
He no longer lives here .
Are these yours , Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t the same man he used to be .
You are only young once .
Please tell me what this is .
Tom knows too much .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
I know that Tom does that every morning .
Get ready quickly .
Do you really not know ?
We &apos;re not going home .
That &apos;s not the only reason .
No one asked for your help .
I would like to meet him .
Where can one buy books ?
It &apos;s for my family .
I have to go see Tom .
Don &apos;t ask so many questions .
Tom isn &apos;t here now .
It &apos;s too late .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us .
I hope that he will come .
We need help .
You &apos;ll never be alone .
Your mother will be back before long .
Can &apos;t we talk about this later ?
They don &apos;t understand .
Tom and Mary are gone .
Tom knows that Mary can &apos;t speak French .
Do you know whether Tom can speak French ?
That may not happen .
I should &apos;ve gone to Boston with Tom .
What do you want me to see ?
It wasn &apos;t that hard .
I know that name .
Tom might still be living in Australia .
Did you already do your homework ?
I didn &apos;t give them anything .
I want more money .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know that .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
I wish I could go to the party with you .
We need to go .
What &apos;s going on with Tom ?
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital ?
Tom no longer works here .
It was good news .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John in a long time .
Tom isn &apos;t at school .
What else does Tom need ?
Tom says I have to study French .
How fast does this train run ?
I want to do it for Tom .
I &apos;d like you to have this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to work .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
There are too many people in the park .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
Tom had the whole house to himself .
Tom wants to see Mary .
Maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
Tom is a good friend of Mary &apos;s .
I love my parents .
I can &apos;t remember anything .
I don &apos;t know who wrote this letter .
What do you like about it ?
When will you get married ?
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
I &apos;ve never met him .
I need more time .
Tom &apos;s my friend .
This is too long .
You should go home . It &apos;s getting late .
He was the only man .
When did you last see my brother ?
That &apos;s another matter .
My eyes are tired .
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
He told me that he was busy .
You &apos;re old enough to know better .
I will have to be away for some time .
This is very bad .
I hope you know that , Tom .
I heard you talking .
I come from Australia .
I was afraid of my father .
Tom arrived just as I was going home .
I don &apos;t want to live this way .
Tom is here , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom will remember .
I &apos;m not going to live here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to believe .
Tom put on some clothes .
It &apos;s good to be home .
I have a few friends .
Why did Tom do that ?
I told Tom I couldn &apos;t do it .
This is not a game .
We &apos;ll be busy .
He said that he would come back here tomorrow .
Tom speaks very good French .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
Tom knew better .
That &apos;s not what I want .
It looks like Tom decided to stay .
We &apos;ve been here before .
He is my teacher .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
You can &apos;t leave yet .
Is this all we need ?
Tom , we have a problem .
Did you see Tom in the park ?
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
I &apos;ve seen a lot .
I &apos;m really happy for you , Tom .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s home .
Why does Tom not like you ?
That &apos;s what they do .
Tom wants something , but I &apos;m not sure what .
I don &apos;t want to eat here .
Do you have everything ?
Tom knows why Mary did that .
I &apos;m not sure how Tom will do it .
That house is big .
I like cake .
It &apos;s enough for five days .
You &apos;ll get it .
You need to go to bed again .
He wants a new car .
I never see you without thinking of my father .
I think you should swim .
Do you want Tom to do that ?
Tom asked Mary to help me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that woman .
Tom is going to do that for me .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy .
Let &apos;s go home .
No one saw that .
He is always happy .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
I knew that already .
What did your wife say ?
I still don &apos;t see it .
I saw nothing at all .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
I won &apos;t go .
She could not believe what she saw .
Can we come , too ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to me .
I heard the good news .
You must do it even if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom wants more .
What do you want to tell us ?
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy everything we need .
I &apos;d like to study French , but I don &apos;t have the time .
I want you to go with me .
What are you going to do to me ?
It made me very rich .
I need to see it now .
I am really sorry to hear that .
Why do you think that Tom did that ?
What do you like about me ?
What are you doing there ?
There is no reason why you shouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
Who are you all ?
I &apos;m going to the police .
I &apos;ll be in Boston for a few days next week .
Do you want something to drink ?
I have hardly any money with me .
I have things to do .
I have time tomorrow morning .
Tom didn &apos;t know this .
She was a great help to me .
I arrived too early .
There &apos;s a reason for it .
I have another good idea .
Is your father a doctor ?
Tom didn &apos;t know exactly what it was that Mary wanted him to do .
What &apos;s happened to the money ?
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary would be there .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
We just need a little more money .
I &apos;ll see you at home .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
Where can I get some help ?
What does Tom do ?
I &apos;m happy about that .
I &apos;d like to visit Boston .
I &apos;ve got a lot of things to do this week .
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow .
I &apos;ll give that to you .
This is a question for Tom .
Nobody knows what has become of him .
I &apos;d like to help you , but I &apos;m a bit busy right now .
I &apos;d never seen anything like that before .
What did Tom do then ?
I have to go with Tom .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
I was very busy yesterday .
Please give me something to eat .
Don &apos;t you want to help ?
Have you told me everything ?
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
I don &apos;t have a house anymore .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
He never takes the train .
That &apos;s enough .
That did me good .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s good .
We &apos;ll never have to do this again .
She went there to swim .
You have to ask Tom first .
I like my house .
You are free to leave any time you wish .
Tom wants to know what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;m going to do that again .
It looks like no one &apos;s home .
We &apos;re just trying to help you .
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom anything .
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
Tom needs to see me right away .
He saw it , too .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
I &apos;m not sick .
How do you do that , Tom ?
I want a picture of that dog .
He &apos;s looking at me .
Tom must be home by 2 : 30 .
You don &apos;t need to work today .
He is not a doctor .
Tom has been in the hospital for a long time .
We &apos;re here , too .
What do you have in your hand ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to eat that if he didn &apos;t want to .
This isn &apos;t about us .
We must help Tom .
We have to stop this .
You better buy that book .
We &apos;re out of money .
Why are people afraid of the police ?
You can &apos;t just go .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a brother .
I &apos;m happy to do this for you .
Do you know how to speak French ?
What about you , Tom ?
Tom looked very happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak a word of French .
Tom said something to Mary in French .
You &apos;ll be very happy here .
He had few other friends .
Can you stay with Tom ?
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to see what would happen . &quot;
Tom asked for help .
Tom would never do that .
There it is .
I &apos;d like to work for you as long as possible .
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
Did you read the whole book ?
Why &apos;s Tom like that ?
I like Boston , too .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom today .
Please give me some more coffee .
Tom has very little money .
You work hard .
That &apos;s true as well .
Give it to me .
If I were you , I would not do it .
Where is your dog ?
If you want to be alone , I &apos;ll leave .
I just did it .
I want to speak French .
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve said .
Tom usually goes to school by bicycle .
Who is this boy ?
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to Boston without you .
I &apos;ve got time .
You sure eat a lot .
Is Tom better than Mary ?
It &apos;s your money , isn &apos;t it ?
Let me have a try at it .
Don &apos;t let go .
This book is easy enough for children to read .
I was home all night .
Tom is from here .
Tom is like a father to me .
How can you help Tom ?
Tom saw Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything to her .
It cannot be true .
I didn &apos;t know you were rich .
She heard him sing .
Tom asked his teacher for advice .
Tom seemed busy .
Tom could get sick .
I am your father .
I think Tom knows why Mary isn &apos;t here .
She asked him some questions .
I &apos;m not like that .
We &apos;re already old .
I can do without it .
Can you please give me something to do ?
Tom knows all about Mary .
Have you ever met Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
This is how I did it .
It &apos;s time to sleep .
I &apos;ve got nothing else to do .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
Is he still here ?
I don &apos;t think we were seen .
Tom won &apos;t do it .
I saw them .
How do you like your new school ?
Tom is better than I am .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house almost every day after school .
I &apos;m going to give it to you .
What was the weather yesterday ?
Can he have said such a thing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom has never been to Boston .
I really should be getting home .
Tom came to my house yesterday .
You &apos;re a good student .
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
It &apos;s probably true .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Is there anything you want to tell us ?
The teacher said , &quot; That &apos;s all for today . &quot;
Do you want me to go home ?
Don &apos;t ask me that again .
I could hear everything .
Is this your dog ?
They know I know .
We play tennis every day .
We &apos;re doing what we love to do .
Tom thinks he knows what Mary wants .
This is what I &apos;m good at .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do that .
I wonder what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I know what you were doing .
You don &apos;t have to go with Tom .
He is not rich , but he is happy .
You &apos;d better not do it .
I think I &apos;m going to go home .
How about tomorrow night ?
What &apos;s there to eat ?
That &apos;s just the way things were back then .
I &apos;ll be going .
I have to work .
I &apos;ve just finished doing that .
Tom and Mary often play tennis together .
It has to be me .
Where &apos;s our money ?
I let the cat into my room .
Tom wasn &apos;t ready .
Tom started reading .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I hope that she will help me .
Do you know where Tom lives ?
What are you getting out of this ?
How much money have you got ?
I know that .
I could do this all day .
I want to see my brother .
How long have you known ?
I need your help .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
Tom is not always busy .
What have you been up to ?
That &apos;s not what Tom wants you to do .
Maybe it &apos;s Tom .
Tom came home by bus .
Tom and Mary are at home today .
&quot; Tom got a new job . &quot; &quot; What kind of job ? &quot;
They &apos;re back .
Tom , there &apos;s something you should know about me .
Let &apos;s try to find a way to help Tom .
I only hope you &apos;re right .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
I know that most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
Everyone wants money .
Tom was one of us .
I think we should go now .
I &apos;m still busy .
Tom could &apos;ve gone .
I was not sure what to do .
I wonder what Tom is doing .
I &apos;m so happy for you both .
You have to leave Boston .
I hope Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Get on with it .
That &apos;s not what Tom does .
Is Boston a big city ?
They aren &apos;t rich .
You need to tell me the truth .
I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
I wish I had a girlfriend .
Let me have a look .
Tom can &apos;t work .
I will never tell !
Tom might be able to do that .
I have no family .
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying .
I knew who did it .
When &apos;ll we know how Tom is ?
Tom isn &apos;t as fast as me .
He doesn &apos;t know English .
Let &apos;s eat out tonight .
Tom isn &apos;t saying why .
She really wants to go .
Is there anything else you would like to eat ?
I really am busy .
Why does Tom have to go ?
I &apos;m very , very happy for Tom .
You seem busy .
When are you coming home ?
It was too difficult for me .
You should ask a doctor .
I no longer love him .
Nobody wants to play with Tom .
Why are you at home ?
I can &apos;t believe he did that .
I wish to see my father .
Have you eaten dinner yet ?
Tom got rich quickly .
It &apos;s not from me .
We &apos;ll have to do that , too .
Do you want another one of these ?
What do you think I should write ?
Many students bought the book .
Please do it quickly .
I go there every day .
I don &apos;t think Tom did it .
I like Boston a lot .
That &apos;s what Tom thought .
What just happened here ?
Maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to tell Tom .
I &apos;ll always remember the first time I saw Tom .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
I don &apos;t see why .
Tom was young .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
He let us go .
It &apos;s good that you &apos;re here .
What are you going to say ?
He can &apos;t buy a car .
We don &apos;t have school tomorrow .
Don &apos;t worry about things that aren &apos;t important .
Why would you want to be a teacher ?
He is rich enough to buy that car .
I heard you .
I didn &apos;t want to talk to the police .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy about it .
I would like to see your mother .
How long ago was this ?
Is this a new car ?
There &apos;s a problem there that you don &apos;t see .
Tom really speaks French well .
I know my way around Australia .
You know it &apos;s not good .
I know where Tom did that .
I wish I had more time to talk with you .
I don &apos;t want your money .
We are students .
He has three children .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I can swim .
When do we want it ?
Let &apos;s go now .
Have you ever seen Tom eat ?
I don &apos;t understand your question .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
I want to know why I &apos;m here .
I want Tom to know that .
Is there a woman in your life ?
Tom , I have something to tell you .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
What &apos;s Tom doing ?
You aren &apos;t thinking .
Let &apos;s try it .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary for a long time .
Everyone knew what to do .
He seems tired .
This is one of mine .
What do you think of the new teacher ?
There &apos;s a new girl in school .
Tom doesn &apos;t look anything like his brother .
Is Tom ready to leave ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom needs that much money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is here .
You &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
This is not good at all .
I &apos;m here to take you home .
Tell them not to leave without me .
Give Tom a drink .
I have to take my son to the doctor .
Let &apos;s go and see Tom .
Can I have a moment ?
Are you sure , Tom ?
The man asked me for some money .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that .
I just found it .
Tom said that &apos;s what he wants to do .
I made him do so .
Why didn &apos;t you buy any coffee ?
I understand that .
Tom said he &apos;d be there .
Tom has asked us not to do that .
He says he met my father .
I &apos;m going to stay at home tonight .
I think that it &apos;s true .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how Mary will get to school tomorrow .
You and I are going to have a lot of fun .
This is where we live .
We &apos;ll try .
Why &apos;d you do that ?
They don &apos;t understand French .
Tom may do that again .
Tom always does that by himself .
I don &apos;t think Tom lives here .
Come back here .
My father is busy now .
You should &apos;ve been here .
I &apos;m not going to do that with Tom .
Tom can &apos;t walk any more .
Tom can &apos;t see you .
Tom seemed to be sure .
It wasn &apos;t hard to understand .
Tom is rich , but he isn &apos;t happy .
Tom can &apos;t swim yet .
Tom knows why .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
This is a good question .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
I am not sure .
Tom and Mary think they know everything .
What &apos;s Tom like ?
What time do you think Tom will be back ?
What &apos;s it look like ?
Give me my money back .
This never happened .
That &apos;s what I like about Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
Don &apos;t tell me what to eat .
I was trying to talk to you .
Where did you buy that book ?
Do you like to be alone ?
Tom is too young to go there by himself .
How many does he want ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
We are afraid .
You &apos;re my brother and I love you .
I want to hear more about Tom .
I &apos;ve got to find it .
What wasn &apos;t easy ?
This is not my car .
I know who lives in this house .
He was home alone at the time .
How do you put up with it ?
He seems happy .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
I wish I were as young as you .
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary had come to Boston .
I wrote a letter .
We &apos;re good at it .
That is no business of his .
They let me go .
Tom said he has to go .
I don &apos;t see Tom doing that .
She came alone .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom yet .
Tom wants a watch like yours .
It &apos;s not going to be like that .
He died a few hours later .
I love this car .
Tom never makes his bed .
I &apos;ll show you my new car .
You can &apos;t make everyone happy .
There &apos;s not much to say .
Tom wasn &apos;t there .
You know this .
That &apos;s more than enough .
There are many people in the park .
It &apos;s not easy .
I &apos;m your age .
She &apos;s not as beautiful as her sister .
Tom and I &apos;ll meet you there .
You will never be alone .
He says he will come .
I can &apos;t think of his name .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
I stay home alone while my parents are at work .
How often do you work here ?
She can &apos;t swim .
She asked him for help .
Can this wait until tomorrow ?
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bit cold .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Are they your friends ?
Is that all you have to say to me ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom here today ?
He lost everything .
Tom found my bicycle .
You &apos;ve got to help me .
My brother is living in Boston .
It &apos;ll be there .
It &apos;s been three years since Tom left Boston .
You always make mistakes .
Mary was thinking about her question .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
I &apos;ll do what I have to do .
Tom hasn &apos;t come home yet .
I asked you not to go there .
The idea isn &apos;t bad .
When did Tom buy his car ?
Tom took off his watch .
There isn &apos;t anybody else .
This is where the accident happened .
I want to ask you about Tom .
What &apos;s taking Tom so long ?
How long are you going to stay in Japan ?
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
He is very sick .
I &apos;m not surprised to hear that .
I &apos;ll stay home and study .
Tom is going to be happy .
Tom speaks French better than Mary .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t know French .
Where &apos;s the cat ?
I &apos;ll never be as good as Tom .
What is Tom eating ?
Tom was fast .
Tom did what he had been told .
You &apos;ll learn a lot here .
It &apos;s cold today !
He will soon be a father .
I like my new job .
My mother loves me .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
I want to meet people and have fun .
Come out and play .
She &apos;s not a good person .
I don &apos;t have a cat , but Tom does .
I got up early yesterday .
When did you buy your car ?
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He has been in Japan for two years .
Can you read that ?
Is Mary Tom &apos;s mother ?
Please think about the problem .
Can I have a beer , please ?
I get the picture .
Tom said he was ready .
Tom was going to do that .
We don &apos;t need him .
There &apos;s something I need to tell you before you leave .
Tom asked something .
I &apos;m never eating here again .
We &apos;re not watching .
How come you know so much ?
Please wait five minutes .
I know that Tom loves you .
Tom will soon become a father .
I didn &apos;t have anything to drink .
What do you want to drink ?
I don &apos;t know that yet .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
How long do you think we &apos;ll have to wait ?
I want to be happy , too .
Tom always looked happy , but never was .
I have to give this book to Tom .
I &apos;d like you to leave now .
I &apos;m going to bed now .
Tom might know .
We just finished .
Tom could be alone .
I heard it .
She and I are the same age .
I was in the hospital last week .
The dog looks sick .
We have enough room for everyone .
How do you think we can help Tom ?
Tell Tom we &apos;re waiting for him .
Tom will be back home soon .
Tom isn &apos;t himself .
What does Tom like to do that Mary doesn &apos;t like to do ?
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether he needs to do that or not .
It &apos;s nice to see Tom so happy .
I feel like I &apos;m thirty years old .
He arrived at the station .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
My watch is ten minutes fast .
They &apos;ll find you .
We &apos;re not getting married .
Tom has a lot of money , but he &apos;s not happy .
I want you to not go to Boston with Tom .
I think I know the answer .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
I don &apos;t have a house in Boston .
If I had time , I would study French .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what to say .
I want to know what you know .
I wonder why I &apos;m so tired .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like me .
Tom and his wife are from Australia .
Do you know why he couldn &apos;t come ?
That &apos;s all Tom wants .
Don &apos;t say that word ever again .
Did Tom say why he wasn &apos;t coming ?
I know a man who speaks French .
He can swim well .
What was he up to ?
I don &apos;t know why he said that to me .
We know who you are .
Tom is from Boston .
You have my word on that .
Please come and see me again .
You did it again .
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
I want it .
I knew what had happened .
Tom wanted a bicycle .
I won &apos;t be able to sleep tonight .
I do not want any money .
How many hours are left ?
This is my question .
Tom didn &apos;t even know who Mary was .
Tom thinks he knows where to find Mary .
It &apos;s been over a year since the accident .
Tom lives there .
Are you afraid of me ?
You have to speak only English .
I know what happened to Tom .
Tom said he was from Australia .
I have some friends in Australia .
I wonder if that &apos;s even possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t work anymore .
You have to give me more time .
I &apos;d better go home .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late .
I wasn &apos;t the only one who was there .
He is better today than yesterday .
Tom wants me to go with him .
I just can &apos;t do it .
I think we &apos;re fine .
Can &apos;t we go with Tom ?
Don &apos;t you want to be here ?
Do you feel like talking about it ?
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
I really like this car .
You &apos;re still a student , aren &apos;t you ?
What were Tom and Mary doing at the hospital ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
The work must be done by Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know why .
Do you know what &apos;s going on there ?
I &apos;ll show you the way .
Why is Tom not doing that ?
Tom and I are going to be fine .
How long have they been here ?
We were surprised how fast the police were there .
Why do you like Boston ?
This one is Tom &apos;s .
How old is your sister ?
I saw Tom before he saw me .
Tom likes it .
I &apos;m coming with Tom .
Tom seemed to be very afraid .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to understand .
I think I &apos;ll do that .
I saw Tom in Boston .
I have already read the book .
I have to tell you the truth .
Where can I find him ?
This is my father &apos;s .
Why aren &apos;t you here ?
Tom wants to know why .
I don &apos;t want you anymore .
We have to think about our children .
I just can &apos;t believe they &apos;re getting married .
What do you love ? What don &apos;t you love ?
I know why you aren &apos;t happy here .
Come back later .
Tom did do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can live without him .
We are working for you .
Tom said that he &apos;d do just about anything for Mary .
I was at school .
What did you do there ?
I don &apos;t want to be seen with him .
Tom says he &apos;s rich .
We should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
I &apos;d like to see what &apos;s going on .
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
Tom couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
It &apos;s there now .
He was surprised to learn this .
It was cold .
I want to see Tom so bad .
We need to know where Tom is now .
I &apos;ve never heard Tom speak French .
I think I know what it is .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it here .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem happy .
Where could the cat be ?
I &apos;ve been asked to do that again .
I want something to eat .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about that .
He did what they told him .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary .
I can drive a car .
I think I know you .
Tom looked into Mary &apos;s eyes .
That won &apos;t be possible .
Tom seems to have left the country .
I know everyone here by name .
I can &apos;t understand that word .
I don &apos;t know how long it &apos;ll last .
He may have read the letter .
Do you still have family in Boston ?
This isn &apos;t French .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this for me .
I don &apos;t want to go to sleep .
I think I did something wrong .
I can &apos;t forget Tom .
They are busy .
Do your homework now .
I see him once in a while .
I need some of your time .
I can &apos;t stay much longer .
I didn &apos;t buy anything for Tom .
Why should they stop ?
They don &apos;t have to go to school today .
There &apos;s no one home .
Let &apos;s try once again .
Tom can swim very well .
I think you have a problem , Tom .
He loves you as much as I do .
I only hope we &apos;re not too late .
It &apos;s more fun than studying .
I thought Tom was going to do that .
What time does the train leave for Boston ?
You &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
Tom , I need to tell you something .
You &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t you ?
Where is that ?
You remember what it was like , don &apos;t you ?
I think Tom has to go to Boston .
They don &apos;t like to do that .
I can &apos;t let Tom see me like this .
He is still too young for the job .
Tom may not know French .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Who else is gone today ?
Tom likes Mary , but Mary likes John .
I only know him by name .
We are happy .
What did you say yesterday ?
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
What &apos;re you eating ?
I had to stay in bed all day .
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary .
I &apos;ll be by later .
Tom is far away .
There &apos;s nothing left to drink .
I think we can get everything we need .
This is very important to me .
I didn &apos;t get much .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary and John don &apos;t like each other .
Tom is thirty years old .
It &apos;s almost time to go to bed .
I want to eat something .
My father got home late last night .
Tom is really late .
Tom wants this one .
How long will we have ?
I &apos;m a child .
It isn &apos;t over yet .
There &apos;s no one in the house .
He asked us to help him .
Tell Tom I want to see him .
Tom wants way too much money .
Give me back my book . I need it again .
Why does Tom do that to himself ?
What do you really think ?
You should come over after work .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
I &apos;ll drink to that .
I love them both .
We want to see it .
It &apos;s what Tom wanted .
Tom has what we all want .
Do you want to play tennis with us ?
It &apos;s already too late .
You don &apos;t want that , do you ?
We &apos;ll have to leave town .
What do you do in Japan ?
Tom is like my brother .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
I think that there is a man there .
You &apos;re needed here at the office .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Is that a cat ?
That room is not very large .
How long was Tom in the water ?
I &apos;ll have what he &apos;s having .
No one lives here anymore .
I hope that Tom will come .
Why do you want this ?
I &apos;ll never do that again .
What does the cat want ?
I wish I &apos;d eaten more .
I don &apos;t think anyone was here yesterday .
I don &apos;t need a girlfriend .
That &apos;s where Tom lives .
I &apos;m not very happy .
Did they say how ?
You &apos;ve got to help us .
Tom and I are afraid .
He still has much to learn .
We &apos;ve got a problem here .
She is not as old as my sister is .
I know Tom loves Mary .
Tom went to the hospital because he was sick .
Tom went back outside .
Why did you not go to Boston ?
Don &apos;t be late for work .
Why don &apos;t you believe me ?
I &apos;ll be right behind you .
Tom says he &apos;s tired .
We &apos;ll talk about that soon .
What are you sorry about ?
I &apos;m not my father .
We do what we want to do .
We have been here for two days .
Tom never gave up .
How &apos;s Tom going to find Mary ?
I have another sister .
I thought we had more time .
He &apos;s at home right now .
I believe you .
That &apos;s what I think , too .
He knows that you know .
Let &apos;s not wait for Tom any longer .
All of my children live in Boston .
What do you think of the book ?
He loves her , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
He arrived as soon as he could .
Is Tom right ?
We know they &apos;ll come .
Tom says he used to study French .
Could you give me a few more minutes ?
I thought Tom would be in his room .
Tom put his clothes back on .
I went into Tom &apos;s room .
Maybe what you said about Tom is right .
Do you want it or not ?
We don &apos;t have to worry about Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in the city .
We need to eat .
You have to stop .
Have you seen my son ?
I &apos;m all out of money .
Tom has a brother in Australia .
I wish I could help you find a good job .
Why are they doing this to me ?
You were happy .
Let &apos;s take a train .
You can &apos;t leave yet , Tom .
When will you finish your homework ?
She gave it to me .
What &apos;re Tom and Mary doing here ?
You talk fast .
I never said it was going to be easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be here .
That &apos;s one of mine .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that .
We were sick .
I want to know what this is .
I wonder if he will come .
I &apos;ll be there all day .
Tom looks very good .
Tom stopped it .
It can &apos;t be helped .
I &apos;ll do this .
Tom can read well .
I won &apos;t say anything .
This is very important to us .
We &apos;re taking off .
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
These are for Tom .
He left early in order not to be late .
I &apos;ll need your help .
We just need a plan .
I don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
It &apos;s a good plan .
I usually go to bed at ten .
Tom is not fast enough .
We &apos;re doing what we have to do .
You must make your parents happy .
You should help your father .
I think Tom knows where Mary lives .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Tom gave it to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
Where do you think we are ?
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
I like it this way .
You don &apos;t need to come into the office tomorrow .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here .
I told Tom I &apos;m from Boston .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen again .
Does it get any better than this ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom lived in Boston .
He did not want her to leave .
Please don &apos;t try this at home .
That &apos;s where I want to live .
Is it a boy or a girl ?
I have no homework today .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
I &apos;m sick of talking about it .
It &apos;s not good .
I love you just as you are .
It &apos;s not hard to find .
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
He may be sick in bed .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
I hope that she will get well soon .
Do you know who those people are ?
My children are in school .
Let &apos;s speak in English .
I &apos;ll tell Tom right now .
Tom is on his way to Australia .
Tom wants to wait .
Just tell me what happened .
Tom is afraid of Mary .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
Can I wait for Tom here ?
I don &apos;t know you .
I need to know tomorrow .
He was all alone in the house .
Tom might go .
I &apos;m not alone .
I want to come , too .
He took off his clothes .
I love it .
Are you up for that ?
I couldn &apos;t understand a word Tom said .
I have to help my mother .
You &apos;re too young to understand .
That &apos;s really good news .
We don &apos;t have to do this .
Tom , what do you think ?
Do you have any idea where Tom might be waiting ?
I thought that Tom was in Boston .
I have no money on me .
This car is his .
I &apos;ll give it to Tom .
That &apos;s not important .
Tom will be a good teacher .
I understand French a little .
He was able to read the book .
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
How many were there ?
The movie isn &apos;t as good as the book .
I don &apos;t want to be like that .
Can we believe them ?
Have you heard what I said ?
There is a letter for you .
I don &apos;t have anything else .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
We don &apos;t want it .
Don &apos;t you know ?
I need your advice .
I shouldn &apos;t drink .
Tom told me you need help .
We can do nothing about it .
French is difficult to learn .
She was very surprised when she heard the news .
We were all a little tired .
Where have you been ?
He came from another country .
His family did not have much money .
It &apos;s Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to remember .
Nobody &apos;s happy .
If I had enough money , I could buy it .
Can you read it ?
I only look like Tom . I &apos;m not Tom .
Why was everyone so surprised ?
Why did you leave ?
When did the accident take place ?
What should I do ?
He &apos;s not sure he &apos;s ready .
I don &apos;t want it anymore .
I want to play .
Where is his family ?
Tom is eating cake now .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what Mary has done .
What kind of person are you ?
Tom didn &apos;t have long to wait .
I believe I can help with that .
Tom could help you .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in over a week .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
We still have to do that .
How about you ?
Who wrote the book ?
Why doesn &apos;t she love me anymore ?
Tom will go to Boston next week .
You &apos;ll understand it later on .
I hear that he &apos;s very rich .
We are good friends .
They found Tom .
How come you ask ?
He &apos;s like a brother to me .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
I don &apos;t love her anymore .
He didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you know what I like ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary .
What did you do last night ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Tom can speak French pretty well .
What &apos;s Tom going to do with it ?
Tom said Mary is often late .
What does this have to do with me ?
I remember how he used to be .
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think he did .
This is the last game .
I would do it again .
Tom looks like a woman .
Why don &apos;t you go there ?
They &apos;ve still got Tom .
We do what we want .
You &apos;ll never be alone again .
Can I speak to Tom ?
Tom asked Mary to leave .
I asked him to wait here .
Tom wanted to talk with Mary .
Have you eaten the cake yet ?
Tom wants to see it .
I need someone to talk to Tom .
I won &apos;t let you go there .
If he doesn &apos;t come , what will you do then ?
I didn &apos;t know you couldn &apos;t sing .
Can you show me the house ?
She is good at playing tennis .
What he did was wrong .
What &apos;s going on with you and Tom ?
I wasn &apos;t there .
I don &apos;t like that word .
What have we got here ?
I hope to see you .
He looked quite tired .
How often do you go to Boston ?
Where did you find these ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to play tennis with Mary .
Don &apos;t ever do that again .
I wish I could help .
Tom knows about this , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom was alone .
I went there to meet him .
Why didn &apos;t Tom come ?
My family is not very large .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too happy .
Tom needs water .
We &apos;ve all done that .
I don &apos;t know how to do anything else .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
Tom wouldn &apos;t speak to Mary .
How many books does he have ?
I have good news .
He does not know how to drive a car .
Just where do you think you &apos;re going ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom did that .
She loves him .
I heard what happened .
That &apos;s not going to help .
I know the whole of the story .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
I wish I were rich .
She will be back at five .
We left together .
I don &apos;t know whether I should believe Tom or not .
What exactly happened there ?
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear Mary .
It &apos;s a little difficult for me .
I &apos;m always surprised by him .
I want time .
Tom never told me that you were so beautiful .
We &apos;ve already done that .
My father bought me this hat .
They &apos;re good people .
I think you &apos;ll want this .
I am better than you .
I &apos;ve found Tom .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d do that .
Is money important to you ?
What is it you want me to do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Where did you get that ?
It may not come to that .
Let &apos;s not forget who Tom is .
Tom wanted me to drive .
Tom wasn &apos;t in the office .
Why am I going ?
Give me a little more water .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
I just want to talk .
We &apos;ll watch you .
I &apos;m not rich enough to buy that .
I need his help .
Why do you want Tom to do that ?
That is our father .
I don &apos;t know your brother .
I &apos;ll be back right away .
I said nothing about the matter .
My father is at home .
I wish you had not told him about the plan .
Why are people afraid of you ?
She is a friend of mine .
Where did this happen ?
What does that have to do with you ?
She really needs your help .
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom ?
Tom is going to be with you .
The doctor may have said so .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe him or not .
I love Boston .
What is going on here ?
Tom &apos;s not home .
You don &apos;t look sick .
What is his name ?
The family wants to buy a house .
I will speak to him alone .
I think you &apos;ll find it .
Tom came with me .
What do you want me to say ?
Tom found the work easy .
We should probably ask Tom .
What &apos;s it like in Boston ?
Give it back to me .
It &apos;s for me .
I know how important this is to you .
I &apos;ll leave you two alone .
Tom needs this .
You &apos;re a good friend .
Tom will like it .
How many people are at this party ?
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
This is what we want to know .
We &apos;ve always done it this way .
I &apos;m able to read French .
Why won &apos;t Tom help us ?
I didn &apos;t need to tell him .
What time can you come ?
How old is he ?
He wrote a letter .
You &apos;re working hard .
I love the idea .
Have you read this yet ?
We &apos;ll come back later .
I am busy now .
Tom may want to do that .
I &apos;ll be free tonight .
Why did she do that ?
Can you please help ?
Tom has a thing for you .
I would like to meet you .
Who told you the story ?
Many people do this .
Tom is my student .
I had nothing else to say .
He &apos;s not a good person .
Tom and I are old friends .
You &apos;re going to have to do it .
Tom and Mary work well together .
He died yesterday .
Tom wants to be happy again .
It has nothing to do with me .
Tom does that because he has to .
You would like it .
Tom is rich , isn &apos;t he ?
I said I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You may stay here as long as you like .
I hope to hear from you soon .
I gave my word .
Have you told your mother ?
I love what I &apos;m doing here .
There &apos;s nothing here .
Tom saw them .
It &apos;s not for me to say .
Maybe they &apos;re busy .
What &apos;ll Tom do with that ?
Tom is here for you .
I know myself very well .
Everyone knows everyone else .
Why are you in Boston ?
I worry about him .
When does Tom have to do that ?
Tom did a lot of things right .
I &apos;m going to visit Tom in the hospital .
I did nothing .
Tom has left for good .
Tom is not in .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary does .
I only wish to help .
It &apos;s been three years since the accident .
He took back what he had said about her .
What was it like living in Australia ?
I still need your help .
Tom can &apos;t do that .
Tom had had enough .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go back to work .
Everyone is against me .
I said too much .
Tom and Mary have a country house .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
Do you have beer ?
Tom and Mary must really like each other .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
Where are the parents ?
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
Tom made many mistakes .
Let me drive you home .
I will do as you say .
I &apos;ll take Tom to Mary .
We should get married .
I had to go back to Boston .
Maybe it &apos;s not too late .
I &apos;m eating .
Did you find a job ?
The house was big .
What was it that you gave him ?
Give me another beer .
She told me she knew my brother .
Let me talk .
Are you in Boston right now ?
I &apos;m happy , very happy .
What is the cat up to ?
This is going too far .
Can we go ?
Are you through with your homework ?
I &apos;m going to stay home today and read a book .
I hardly ever see Tom anymore .
What do you think I &apos;m doing ?
He is not angry anymore .
No one ever asked .
This is life !
Tom has known Mary ever since they were children .
She came to see me .
There &apos;s nothing more I can tell you .
I wish you could &apos;ve come with us .
I just want to let you know that I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
I want to go there once more .
I &apos;m going there now .
He is young .
I &apos;ll never be late again .
Tom wants to come home .
What are you two doing here ?
She will get well in a week .
Can Tom come , too ?
Tom often comes late .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
We haven &apos;t seen anyone .
He may be on the next train .
We remember .
Tom may come today .
I don &apos;t see Tom a whole lot .
I think I &apos;d want to know .
I want you to go to Boston .
Are you there ?
What do they know ?
I &apos;m sorry , Tom . I can &apos;t do it .
I think Tom may want to do that .
Do you have enough food ?
That &apos;s not exactly true .
That &apos;s all they had .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will be here .
I don &apos;t plan to meet Tom until tomorrow .
That &apos;s not true .
How old were you then ?
Tom wasn &apos;t home .
I don &apos;t do those things .
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour .
I can &apos;t give you the answer today .
There &apos;s a party after work .
They want to learn English .
We &apos;re coming with you , Tom .
I enjoy being with you .
You &apos;ll do it .
Tom couldn &apos;t talk .
I make a good living .
I like her . She &apos;s so beautiful !
Are you sure you didn &apos;t do anything ?
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
I wish that were true .
How old do you think Tom is ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
Did you see anybody there ?
Tom has just come home .
I &apos;ve got to do my homework now .
Please tell me how to do that .
No one &apos;s here .
Tom knows when to stop .
Let me try it .
Tom saw the bus .
I heard that Tom has left his wife .
Tom has to go home .
Is this your homework ?
Tom can &apos;t have gone far .
I wanted Tom to do that .
I don &apos;t have any books to read .
They &apos;re doing OK .
How is Tom going to Boston ?
I may have to go to Boston .
I want to live in the country .
Tom got here an hour before Mary .
I can &apos;t remember who I am .
Tom is out .
We can &apos;t stop now .
They &apos;ll understand us .
I &apos;d never ever do that .
I like this music .
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
How was your day ?
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
Tell me what it was like .
I know that you still think about me .
This looks good .
It &apos;s too good to be true .
What did you eat for dinner last night ?
Why does this always happen to me ?
I just wanted to get it over with .
You can do it , Tom . I know you can .
He looked very happy .
I have a daughter that goes to school with Tom .
When will you come ?
Tom knows that he has to do that .
Tom won &apos;t do that again .
He doesn &apos;t know any of us .
Tom is worried about me .
Tom wants to leave .
Are you able to speak French ?
She said she was happy .
I only have ten books .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary the truth in the first place .
I know something you don &apos;t .
Come into the room .
He &apos;ll become a father soon .
Tom asked me if I were happy .
Where did you get it ?
Tom may have been sick .
What are we going to do with that ?
I need something to eat .
We don &apos;t have a plan .
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
I &apos;ve found something .
I hope Tom knows .
You have to see it to believe it .
Can someone please help me ?
You &apos;ll be asleep by the time your father gets home .
You have to make Tom believe you .
Tom had a dog .
You know it better than me .
I let Tom drink some of my beer .
I don &apos;t like my job .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll be here .
I am very tired .
How long have you had this problem ?
I just told Tom the truth .
They &apos;re no good .
I think it &apos;s good .
They &apos;re friends .
You &apos;ve got to do it now .
I &apos;ve got to see you .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t forget Tom .
I don &apos;t know any of her students .
Is this the best you can do ?
I still haven &apos;t found work .
He is sure to come .
I &apos;d like to spend more time with my family .
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
I want you to go there .
He must buy a new bicycle for his son .
You &apos;re hard to understand .
It has nothing to do with you .
He started to sing .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
It might be Tom .
I &apos;d like three of these .
Tom is here with us .
I don &apos;t understand French at all .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t speak French .
Who is he ?
The only one here who &apos;s able to do that is Tom .
I found this under your bed .
I wanted this .
I want to give Tom this .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , is he ?
Tom was too angry to speak .
What does your sister do now ?
This one &apos;s for me .
I &apos;m very worried about you .
Tom didn &apos;t let his children go to Mary &apos;s party .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
I don &apos;t need a car .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
I hope Tom isn &apos;t early .
Where &apos;s your phone ?
I &apos;ll meet you there in an hour .
I cannot quite understand it .
He is something like his father .
I ate too much .
Tom seems to be angry .
I have seen him once .
Everyone &apos;s talking about what Tom did .
What do you know about Boston ?
It was like that when I got it .
Where &apos;s my brother ?
We hardly see you anymore .
I can &apos;t go home .
It seems that Tom can &apos;t swim .
Why am I still here ?
You &apos;re too good for me .
I like school .
Tom knows the family .
Tom seems lost .
Tom had no idea of what was going on .
That &apos;s not possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you .
What kind of person would do such a thing ?
Everyone has been there .
We see each other once a month .
Tom seemed to know exactly what he was doing .
We &apos;re still together .
You can &apos;t help them .
Tom lives really far from here .
How did you find me ?
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak much French .
Tom wants to be in Boston .
Your mother is very young , isn &apos;t she ?
I think Tom has never been to Boston .
You made it possible .
That &apos;s better than nothing .
No one works there anymore .
I &apos;ve come to see you .
I don &apos;t know what Tom said .
When was the last time you made your bed ?
I think I know what to do .
It may be that he likes his job .
We &apos;re happy to be here .
Why can &apos;t you come ?
You never told me you had a brother .
I really like them .
I can do more .
I think I know why .
That &apos;s been tried .
He may be the very man that I need .
Tom said he needed our help .
Is that your new book ?
I haven &apos;t seen him for a long time .
What are these things ?
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
You tried .
He &apos;s not home .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
I tried to get Tom to help Mary .
This is a very good question .
She looks very young .
I just did that this morning .
I don &apos;t like doing that .
I think they like you .
I think we should wait until Tom gets here .
Is it done ?
He didn &apos;t stop talking .
We &apos;re very busy .
I just want to forget about it .
I don &apos;t really want to do that .
Tom kept Mary waiting .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
This hat is mine .
It sure is cold today .
It &apos;s bad for you .
I know where Tom is .
Tom didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I &apos;m not so sure anymore .
Tom may not want to go .
What &apos;re you doing about this ?
I said we aren &apos;t going to do it .
There are only two days left .
It &apos;s fine today .
Which one do you like best ?
Maybe Tom was right .
I thought you &apos;d like to see this .
I asked Tom if he knew Mary .
I now know why Tom did what he did .
I still want to hear Tom &apos;s opinion .
We &apos;re doing OK .
I don &apos;t really like him .
These are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom came with Mary .
I won &apos;t say a word .
Don &apos;t give it to Tom .
My parents don &apos;t like my girlfriend .
There &apos;s still a lot to do .
This book isn &apos;t very good .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his son to turn out like me .
That &apos;s what you want to do , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ve told you all of this once already .
I like the people here .
There are a lot of people in the park .
Tom came to Japan as a child .
She &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
What are you here for ?
This is too big .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is doing that .
Tom has come to see you .
Tom was with me all day .
Do you know something I don &apos;t know ?
How long have you been in this town ?
Tom will probably like this game .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell me .
She should help her mother .
Tom &apos;s alone .
I want something to drink now .
We &apos;re not doing that again .
Does Tom have long hair ?
Why can &apos;t we just go home ?
I have to drive this car .
Your parents know where you are .
She is going to learn how to drive .
He didn &apos;t study at all .
They don &apos;t know that .
Tom knows who they are .
Would you like to see it now ?
They were right .
Tom still lives at home .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
We know where Tom is .
This man is very , very old .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
How many times do I have to tell you ?
He has to come .
I never want to hear his name again .
I don &apos;t want to have children .
I will buy a new car next month .
Do you want to go home now ?
I can &apos;t talk now . I &apos;m too busy .
You should eat something .
I know someone who speaks French well .
Tom &apos;s gone .
I &apos;ll wait for a week .
I don &apos;t know for sure .
Did Tom study French yesterday ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother .
They are reading her book .
I &apos;ve got nothing left .
It &apos;s difficult .
Where &apos;s my hat ?
Do you two want to be alone ?
Did Tom eat this morning ?
He arrived with me .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with Tom .
Tom told me about it .
You could have told me .
Do you know what they want ?
We can do it right now .
What should I say to Tom ?
We should help Tom .
Tom says that he &apos;s very rich .
Tom should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
You all remember Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I want something else to read .
Tom is a good man .
It &apos;s good to talk to you .
I just want people to like me .
Let him do it .
I should &apos;ve been ready .
How can we meet new people ?
I can &apos;t believe it !
We have been good friends for ten years .
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
As you like .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to meet you .
You &apos;d better stay here .
Tom and Mary are getting married on Monday .
Are you ready to eat ?
We &apos;re like family .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
Tom just doesn &apos;t want to hear this .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about it .
What do you think about that ?
Tom will do that .
I couldn &apos;t sleep at all .
Tom seemed very surprised .
I &apos;m very busy .
You can make your own .
Where will you be ?
He can do it well , and you can do it even better .
I have a lot of friends .
Tom won &apos;t go alone .
I &apos;ll do what you want .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom &apos;s not in his car .
We know very little about it .
Tom and I &apos;ve decided to get married .
I wish it had never happened .
Let me see that .
I was busy the whole day .
The woman is beautiful .
I &apos;ll go to the park .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
We all felt sorry for Tom .
I &apos;m sorry for what I did .
My father works here .
They &apos;re right behind you .
Is Tom back yet ?
We went to Boston by bus .
Tom really likes Mary .
We &apos;re all happy .
Tom is rich .
Who is going to speak tonight ?
I want to see how Tom lives .
You always were good at your job .
I haven &apos;t finished reading this book .
You remember Tom and Mary , don &apos;t you ?
He should have done that long ago .
I &apos;m out of money .
He has left his family .
Where &apos;s the dog ?
Tom and I both don &apos;t understand French at all .
Tom knows what Mary wants to do .
Do you want the job ?
This is the woman I told you about .
Tom is better than me .
This is his answer to my letter .
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on around here .
I think that &apos;ll do .
A car went by .
What do you make of this ?
How is the weather ?
This water is good to drink .
You three seem to want something .
Why am I not surprised ?
You &apos;re a good boy .
I need a little help .
I was surprised when I saw that .
Tom &apos;s got school tomorrow .
Is that all you want ?
I &apos;ll be going with you .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the movie .
We &apos;ll see how it goes .
Tom didn &apos;t come .
I don &apos;t think Tom has as much money as Mary does .
You should read many books when you are young .
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .
Why did he come here ?
When &apos;s Tom coming ?
I know Tom loves living here .
How do you take your coffee ?
Tom seems to be rich .
I know Tom is in Boston .
The problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom made Mary do that .
Is he your teacher ?
He looks very tired .
Tom is playing outside .
Who wants it ?
Tom said that Mary likes you .
You &apos;d probably really like it .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
His house is not far from here .
How did you get those ?
There &apos;s so much more to learn .
Can you do it ?
Are you sure about this ?
Tom wasn &apos;t that bad .
He could speak French .
Who are you and what are you doing here ?
Come back soon .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning .
Tom and I were both right .
He was busy .
What do you like about Tom ?
I &apos;ve finished reading that book .
I hope Tom comes soon .
Why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
You don &apos;t look happy .
I wish I had a brother .
You have to see it .
I wonder if Tom can hear us .
I probably should have said something .
Why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
What &apos;ll you do after school today ?
She looked around her room .
Where are you going exactly ?
Tom got really angry .
You &apos;re right , as always .
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
I can &apos;t believe Tom is gone .
I think that this is the way to do it .
You &apos;re young .
You always do that by yourself , don &apos;t you ?
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I think we shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
What are you sorry for ?
There &apos;s nothing left to be done .
Why is Tom here ?
I want very much for you to understand .
I &apos;ll be good to Tom .
Let me see what &apos;s in your hand .
It &apos;s a very good question .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m in Australia .
When did you and Tom do that ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
You know what Tom said about Mary , don &apos;t you ?
Is Tom sure ?
Why should I learn French ?
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s a doctor .
I think he likes you .
You never know .
That &apos;s not how we think .
I stopped going there .
I don &apos;t understand at all .
I really like that girl .
I don &apos;t understand why she doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
They &apos;ll come .
Did Tom talk about it ?
I never had a girlfriend before .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I know .
Do you want to drink anything ?
I think Tom is looking at us .
I don &apos;t get this .
We can &apos;t be sure , can we ?
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
I never talked to Tom .
I think Tom likes me .
I just want to talk to you .
Tom said he was ready to talk .
What &apos;re you good at ?
Tom is through .
No one should ever have to do that .
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
He came back soon .
Is that what you think of me ?
I &apos;m so tired !
We want Tom to go home .
I don &apos;t know them .
Did Tom say where Mary might be ?
Tom didn &apos;t know anything about Mary .
Tell us the truth , Tom .
I &apos;ll give you a new one .
I &apos;m going to make you a drink .
You won &apos;t believe what I just saw .
Why are you doing this here ?
That isn &apos;t what I said .
Tom seemed angry .
He told me the truth .
Who &apos;s your girlfriend ?
This is where I went to school .
Did you come by car ?
It isn &apos;t like that .
We &apos;ll all go together .
I &apos;ll be back after lunch .
I don &apos;t want to have to do this .
Tom has money .
Are you out of work ?
What else do you need ?
You don &apos;t need to do that if you don &apos;t want to .
I &apos;ll see you very soon .
We &apos;ll do what we have to do .
My father must do the work .
How are you doing for money ?
Tom makes his own bed every morning .
You look surprised .
It &apos;s me .
They left before the end of the movie .
We &apos;re not always right .
What &apos;re they going to do to Tom and Mary ?
Tom should really do that .
I am free this afternoon .
Tom isn &apos;t with us .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
Who told you I was talking about you ?
I have no idea who Tom is .
I think we need more water .
What &apos;ll you do there ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want me here , does he ?
I just want to sleep .
Tom &apos;s finished .
Tom doesn &apos;t live very far away .
I &apos;m not here .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
I think it &apos;s important to tell the truth .
Where did you see them ?
I &apos;m surprised to hear you say that .
Tom won &apos;t be away for long .
How are you going to do it ?
Tom came to see me .
That &apos;s what I said all along .
This is it .
I forgot to ask Tom .
Why did you do it , Tom ?
We were a little tired .
It &apos;s not too much .
What &apos;s there to do ?
Do you remember what Tom said ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
That was the only thing Tom could do .
Tom didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
I read a book today .
Do you want to come over to my house ?
I &apos;ll be outside if you need me .
You need to learn French .
That &apos;s the one we want .
I &apos;d be happy here , I think .
What &apos;ll you be doing ?
Tom looked tired .
It was three hours ago .
Tom is not happy .
Do you want to be rich ?
Is Tom alone ?
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
We know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
Just tell me where Tom is .
I did what I could .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know the answer .
How else can I help you ?
Where are the children ?
Why can &apos;t we just tell Tom that we can &apos;t do it ?
Let Tom do this .
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
Tom thought Mary was busy .
You &apos;re good , aren &apos;t you ?
Is she beautiful ?
&quot; Who is in the car ? &quot; &quot; Tom is . &quot;
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
Tom has been in Boston for a week now .
Where &apos;s Tom ?
Tom might hear you .
They are happy .
I don &apos;t like to be surprised .
I &apos;ve seen enough .
Why are you alone ?
I saw Tom again .
I don &apos;t have a phone .
What should Tom have done ?
That &apos;s not nice .
You know it doesn &apos;t matter .
I can tell you that it didn &apos;t happen .
Everyone but Tom is wearing a hat .
Tom asked Mary if she would help him .
Where are you , Tom ?
That &apos;s what I would do in your place .
Tom is a very good boy .
Tom knows where Mary lives .
You can read this book .
Tom has been out of work for over a month .
This is where my father works .
She always looked happy , but never was .
I have a girlfriend back home .
I &apos;d love to know that .
I want to go with you , Tom .
I &apos;ll be at home tonight .
This is very important .
Tom can &apos;t come , because he &apos;s sick .
Is that book for me ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom will help us .
Tom and Mary want to know what &apos;s going on .
The question is who &apos;ll do it .
This is the end of my story .
I &apos;m right .
He has a bicycle .
She went to the park with him .
What &apos;s Tom do ?
How well can you play tennis ?
I really wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
I wish I could stay with you .
Just what exactly are you trying to say ?
I &apos;m still not sure what you mean by that .
Who else knew about it ?
The last train has already gone .
Tom says he &apos;s busy .
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
We all have a lot to learn .
No one likes Tom .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
I &apos;m not you .
We don &apos;t know where he is .
Where did everyone else go ?
Tom is happy .
What &apos;s it going to be ?
Why did you buy this car ?
She &apos;ll try it once more .
She may not come .
Tom and I aren &apos;t coming .
I know where she is .
It &apos;s quite large .
I just want a little more coffee .
Tom asked Mary to make him something to eat .
Tom thought Mary was right .
He won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
It wasn &apos;t mine .
Tom left without me .
Tom is like Mary .
What &apos;ll you give me ?
We have no school tomorrow .
Is that you , Tom ?
Tom has a cat , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
Give me a little time .
Tom wants advice .
Tom won &apos;t eat that .
What Tom wants to do isn &apos;t going to help .
I haven &apos;t yet finished my homework .
It was very hard .
How old is he now ?
You did really well .
I am no longer a child .
Have you finished dinner ?
Where should Tom go ?
Tom told me his job was a lot of fun .
I know that was a mistake .
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him .
Are you there , Tom ?
We &apos;ve been talking about you .
You &apos;ve already done that .
I think I just saw something .
Are you sure you &apos;re well enough to go to school ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that again .
I have no idea .
Why aren &apos;t they worried ?
The teacher gave us a lot of homework .
You should probably go .
I am going to write a letter tomorrow .
I think we should go .
I want you to go to the doctor .
We don &apos;t want you here .
You &apos;re too big .
Nobody wants to talk about that .
I found it .
How well do you know Tom ?
I wrote it myself .
Everyone knows what they have to do , right ?
I bought it yesterday .
Tom is fast , but Mary isn &apos;t .
I have no friend to talk with .
I don &apos;t know who the man is .
We have very little time .
Where &apos;s my wife ?
Where is your money ?
I must have lost it .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
I &apos;m going .
If you want something done right , you have to do it yourself .
I can &apos;t make out what she wants .
I &apos;ll never forget that .
I wish I had been with her then .
What &apos;s up with you and Tom ?
I didn &apos;t see him .
Let Tom sing .
He does nothing but play all day .
I like the dog .
Can I help ?
Tom asked Mary to help him with his homework .
Tom can &apos;t walk anymore .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you . I want to help you .
I always wanted a dog .
It just has to be done .
I &apos;ve got a book .
She doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
This is where Tom lives .
You know Tom likes Mary .
Why are we doing this again ?
Tom knows that Mary loves him .
This is my sister .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom told me .
I need some time alone .
Who &apos;s talking ?
I want to find Tom .
We &apos;re not alone .
I have to learn French .
He knows a lot of people .
I have no idea what Tom said .
The girl went to sleep .
Is it for me ?
Tom is happy again .
It is not his business .
That won &apos;t help you .
I &apos;m in Boston all this week .
Who bought this ?
Let me look into it .
Tom had all day to get that done .
Tom needs us .
You should buy it for yourself .
Tom can &apos;t help the way he is .
Can I leave now ?
Don &apos;t make Tom do that .
I &apos;m in school .
Tom and I &apos;ll go with Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t like Mary .
I &apos;m in the house .
Tom can swim , but Mary can &apos;t .
We want to leave .
I wish that I could help .
It looks like Tom is afraid .
Tom won &apos;t stop .
Tom can read .
I &apos;m going to take you to Tom .
That is a table .
Your time &apos;s up .
I &apos;ll be alone .
I will say something about it .
I sat in the car .
I &apos;ve got to get back to Boston .
You can stay here as long as you want .
I &apos;ll be there in about 30 minutes .
What can I get you ?
I &apos;m very sorry .
It &apos;s about time to go to school .
I am happy to meet you .
I tried to help her .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t have enough money on me at this time .
I want to know why you don &apos;t like me .
Tom isn &apos;t tired .
Your answer is wrong .
Why are you doing this ?
Can I eat ?
Did Tom say he needed to do that ?
What &apos;s your cat &apos;s name ?
What is the name of this river ?
She won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
If you want , you can go .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who Mary is .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
Tom has gone for good .
We know where your family lives .
Tom would like to study French .
I have a lot of friends in Boston .
I never said I wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom has left the city .
I don &apos;t do that as often as Tom does .
When was the last time you were in Boston ?
Tom was able to help Mary .
She needs someone to talk to .
I &apos;d like to show this picture of Tom to you .
I &apos;m very sorry about this .
There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
Where do you work ?
You &apos;re a good person .
Tom is making dinner .
I met Tom today .
Do you know that ?
Tom didn &apos;t know how old Mary was .
I was a little afraid .
You can &apos;t buy anything if you have no money .
What &apos;re we going to do ?
I should tell Tom the truth .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had .
Tom became rich .
My father was never around .
I found this in Tom &apos;s room .
He likes money .
May I ask why it is that you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
He will write an answer very soon .
Tom asked Mary to stay .
Tom is trying .
You know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
You should &apos;ve come yesterday .
Tom asked for Mary &apos;s help .
Do you have a question ?
Thank you for doing this , Tom .
You can &apos;t trust anything he says .
I think I understand it now .
It &apos;s too large .
What if Tom was right ?
I hope you know that .
Let me leave !
You look like your father looked thirty years ago .
Why do you care so much ?
It is up to you .
How many times has Tom done that this month ?
I need to know by tomorrow .
It almost happened .
This is where I want to be .
Tom looks pretty bad .
It is very cold today .
I found them .
I want you to do this work .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do next .
Is Tom out there ?
I need the truth .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I &apos;ve got good news for you , Tom .
I know where the money is .
I think they saw us .
Is that your son ?
I &apos;ve never heard of him .
Let &apos;s visit Tom .
The girl seems to be rich .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything about himself .
I &apos;m going to give it to Tom .
Thank you for today .
Tom wanted to wait for the next bus .
You were late for work .
I &apos;m glad I could help you .
We can talk about it later .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
Why not let Tom try ?
Don &apos;t put it that way .
I am very glad to see you .
She doesn &apos;t have any children , does she ?
He looked pretty tired .
I bought a new bicycle .
I &apos;ll do that for Tom .
Tom said that he &apos;d come .
Tom wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary .
I want Tom here .
Did you like the movie ?
Tom knows what &apos;s up .
Tom was born there .
You could have been happy .
Did Tom have his dinner ?
She made him rich .
You don &apos;t understand .
We both know what you &apos;re doing .
We &apos;re not in Boston .
Do you want me to go with you ?
I know that he &apos;s Tom .
I had no idea you were in here in Boston .
I think Tom likes to do that .
I &apos;m going to study French .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;ll live .
I &apos;d like to become a doctor .
Tom never said anything about where he &apos;d been .
Please give me one .
Mary likes Japan , doesn &apos;t she ?
Don &apos;t be too sure .
Tom wouldn &apos;t like it .
Tom just never should &apos;ve done that .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember anything .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t want this .
How long have you been in this country ?
I know that Tom works very hard .
If you don &apos;t want to sing , you don &apos;t have to .
How long does Tom have ?
There &apos;s nothing there .
It is not far away from the hotel .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he could do that .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary .
It wasn &apos;t hard .
They know that .
I can never go home again .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Tom has been here for three hours .
Tom wants to play .
This is big .
We &apos;ve found Tom .
I had fun here .
Who goes there ?
He &apos;s right behind me .
You know French , don &apos;t you ?
I haven &apos;t been busy since yesterday .
Tom must &apos;ve seen Mary there .
I want to meet Tom .
I haven &apos;t seen her in years .
They tell me you &apos;re OK .
This time I &apos;ll try it .
This job is too much for me .
Tom should &apos;ve been home from school hours ago .
That &apos;s not the problem .
Tom has been to Boston only once .
I have family in Boston .
I was there last night .
Tom was very busy today .
We will never do it again .
I think Tom said that .
I don &apos;t like what we &apos;ve become .
Thank you for this .
I like that one .
I wonder whether Tom will help us .
He seemed to like that .
That &apos;s not my opinion .
No one knows where we are .
I like this job .
Tom is going to be thirty next year .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d remember me .
Maybe she knows the answer .
We &apos;ll do everything we can .
What exactly did you do ?
Tom is doing what he has to do .
I &apos;m not going to do this .
You need to stop .
Can you believe that ?
Tom has been sick in bed for a week now .
I don &apos;t think your name &apos;s Tom .
I already saw this .
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
Tom will try it .
I thought you said someone was going to meet us .
I &apos;m good .
You must have made a mistake .
I no longer need them .
If I &apos;d wanted to go , I would &apos;ve said so .
There were only six people at the party .
Tom had to do it .
Tom will find you .
Tom has left us .
Tom wants to talk to you .
Have you eaten yet ?
He made it for his sister .
I don &apos;t know who can do that and who can &apos;t .
They know who you are .
Have the children eaten yet ?
Are you almost ready ?
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents ?
You don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s home is , do you ?
What &apos;ll Tom show Mary ?
You know what Tom wants .
Is Tom in ?
How old is your cat ?
You &apos;ve been a great help .
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston .
Tom and Mary look good together .
Is that it ?
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
I don &apos;t care for him .
Are you at Tom &apos;s ?
I &apos;ve already heard this story .
What could be the reason ?
That &apos;s over .
Where were you three years ago ?
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
Who are those children ?
Tom took the bus to school .
Her son has her eyes .
This has been a long week .
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom lives in Boston with his mother .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it .
Tom isn &apos;t good at French .
I &apos;ll give you a book .
We &apos;re not where we want to be .
What &apos;s become of your dog ?
That &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is doing that .
How did it go ?
I know exactly where you are .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
I wouldn &apos;t want to keep Tom waiting .
Did he go home yesterday ?
He didn &apos;t say a word .
How are they doing this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will visit Boston .
Tom wants to have a talk with Mary .
I &apos;m afraid .
I want to talk to her .
Have you heard from Tom ?
Are you home ?
You should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
I like these .
I thought you might like one of these .
I &apos;m very happy .
It looks like you &apos;re thinking about something else .
Tom is going to go home .
I should have done this years ago .
I don &apos;t have what I want .
I &apos;ll take you there .
I wish I had eaten more .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go if he doesn &apos;t want to .
This book is so difficult that I can &apos;t read it .
Do you want me to go away ?
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
You &apos;re going to be a father .
That was bad .
Tom was really sick .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
May I eat a little of it ?
I arrived here yesterday .
I never forgot you .
Your story is hard to believe .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
I &apos;m as old as Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is saying what she really thinks .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t need my help .
I don &apos;t like beer .
Tom looks tired this morning .
Can you drive ?
What do you want to be ?
There &apos;s something I have to know .
I &apos;m coming with you .
I will buy a car .
We will come together .
What really happened ?
Tom can do better than that , I think .
I hope that you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
My father can swim , but my mother can &apos;t .
Why don &apos;t you go alone ?
Tom asked her if she was Mary .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed a little longer .
My hour has not yet come .
I can &apos;t find Tom .
I will get it for you .
What &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t happy .
I have three friends who can speak French .
Tom was in Boston last week , wasn &apos;t he ?
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
It wasn &apos;t my wife on the phone .
I want to know what you see right now .
You have no idea who that is , do you ?
Tom ate nothing .
Why didn &apos;t you say it like that ?
The river was beautiful .
Tom , where are you ?
It wasn &apos;t the first time .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
It &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom seemed to remember me .
This isn &apos;t about me or Tom .
Tom has to leave in a few minutes .
She went with him to Boston .
I can &apos;t understand what happened .
Tom takes the bus to work .
The old man sat all alone .
I need a new bicycle .
Tom is on his way home .
When would you like me to come over ?
I didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
I know that Tom was at your house today .
Tom couldn &apos;t say anything else .
Tom , I need your help .
I think we should visit Boston .
No one was to be seen on the street .
That &apos;s not good enough .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
I think we &apos;re too young .
He has no wife , no children and no friends .
How bad do you want this job ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time to help Mary right now .
&quot; Where &apos;s his book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
What are you doing tonight ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know the answer yet .
Her sister looks young .
We found Tom .
The good news is that we &apos;ll be able to help you .
What do you want to do with it ?
I will stay at home .
Tom can do just about anything .
I thought you told me you couldn &apos;t speak French .
How exactly do you do that ?
I forgot to ask him .
You must have lost them .
When was it that you first met her ?
Tom did everything he could .
Tom was home alone .
I don &apos;t want Tom &apos;s help .
It looks like we have everything .
Get Tom to help you .
What has that to do with me ?
I think this is a good thing .
Mary likes you .
Tom was looking quite happy .
You &apos;re the only one I have .
She can drive a car .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here ?
Tom walked in the room .
We plan to go as far as we can .
We need to talk .
I saw Tom and Mary .
When is he coming back ?
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
It wasn &apos;t difficult to understand .
She has something in her hand .
You should meet him .
Tell me the truth .
What makes you happy makes me happy .
This is going to be good .
I did it for him .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
This makes me very angry .
How are you going to do that ?
It is time for her to go home .
Tom and Mary were there , too .
That looks like tea .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do .
You &apos;re busy , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom said Mary was his daughter .
I know exactly where Tom is .
We aren &apos;t going to do that .
Tom knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
I know where it is .
I wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I &apos;m so sorry about that .
Tom knows what he wants .
I &apos;ll give you this book .
Tom looks busy today .
We need to do this .
Tom bought himself a new car .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t worry .
I have no money to buy the book with .
I met him once .
His sister looks young .
They &apos;re there alone .
I just didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom was angry .
I &apos;ll sing .
Tom is a father .
He came into the room .
Where is my watch ?
I never asked for it .
Many people were there .
That &apos;s a very good car .
I wonder who she is .
What do you want to do about Tom ?
The girl always looked happy , but she wasn &apos;t at all happy .
I thought it might be true .
I know you &apos;re not like that .
Tom is my sister &apos;s boy .
I know what Tom said .
Tom and Mary are getting married next year .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure what to do .
Don &apos;t ever do it again .
We have a cat and a dog .
Why am I here ?
Tom is going to take you home .
You can &apos;t swim , can you ?
I will stay .
I &apos;m going with Tom .
Tom already knew the answer .
What would you like me to make you for dinner ?
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
I know it was you .
Tom can &apos;t stop .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be back before long .
This isn &apos;t good .
You know I have to go .
Tom didn &apos;t know about it .
Tom can read and write .
I &apos;ve never done that before .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he heard .
I think Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
I know what you &apos;re after .
I think that he won &apos;t come .
They had no money left .
I &apos;d like to see that .
Did you enjoy it ?
Let me have a look at it .
I can &apos;t read French .
Tom has to do that , too .
Tom is out here .
You are not a child anymore .
I enjoy being a teacher .
Tom said he wants to go .
I didn &apos;t know Tom would be here today .
What does your son do ?
I &apos;ve thought about you a lot .
I can be there in ten minutes .
That &apos;s a good plan .
Tom always looked busy , but never was .
Is Tom here , too ?
Do you want to know his name ?
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
Did Tom ask us to wait ?
The party was just getting started .
I gave the book to my friend .
Do you really want to be here ?
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
Tom was there yesterday .
Give me what I want .
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
They are not tired .
This is the last time .
I met your father yesterday .
Tom seems to be getting angry .
Tom is going to come on Monday .
I came here to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do this .
Tom is rich , but not me .
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon ?
I hope that Tom does that .
Why are we going to Boston ?
I &apos;ll be right there .
I can live with that .
We &apos;re waiting for Tom .
You have him there .
I know her well .
This happened for a reason .
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
Tom had a problem with Mary .
We don &apos;t want that anymore .
I know the man you came with .
Why is she doing this ?
I know you don &apos;t have time to help us .
These aren &apos;t for you .
Why do you think Tom isn &apos;t here ?
I didn &apos;t want to be here in the first place .
That &apos;s how life is .
Who was right ?
We only have one year to get this done .
How many of you are there ?
It &apos;ll be a good day .
I found Tom there .
Why did they just leave ?
Give me a few .
If you want me to help you , all you have to do is ask .
Are you tired ?
How &apos;s it going with your family ?
Tom just couldn &apos;t stop .
What doesn &apos;t Tom know ?
He is getting old .
I am well .
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
May I ask you something ?
You &apos;ve told me that before .
What did they tell you ?
Did you forget something ?
Where is your sister ?
This should be fun .
You must get ready quickly .
My sister likes Tom .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s office .
We have to go to school .
Tom often goes there .
Are these all your books , Tom ?
I should do that right away .
They aren &apos;t happy .
You have done very well .
It is easy to read this book .
Do you really want to know what I think ?
We should do this again .
I &apos;ll be here until next week .
Tom makes me better .
It was an accident .
Let me know .
This is the book I told you about .
Tom knew he needed to leave town .
I had no reason to stay .
I know he is busy .
I want a beer .
I did this for you .
Why is Tom &apos;s car still here ?
You look just like your father .
I can &apos;t let you leave .
Tom and Mary have nothing to do .
Tom and I are friends .
I asked Tom if there was something I could buy for him .
Tom has to speak French at work .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary was .
Tom wrote two books .
I &apos;ve known Tom for more than thirty years .
What are you watching ?
Tom said John is a good man .
I don &apos;t like this movie .
He is a doctor .
Let &apos;s get some lunch .
We don &apos;t need your help .
Tom wants to get married again .
How is it going with your family ?
What would I do without you ?
Who is that woman ?
If you want to be happy , then be happy .
I don &apos;t want to leave Tom .
We became good friends .
I &apos;m in Boston .
Is there anyone else ?
Tom arrived early .
There &apos;s not enough water .
I &apos;m sure I saw her two years ago .
Let &apos;s forget about this .
Can his story be true ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
I don &apos;t think I said that .
I know what &apos;s right .
They &apos;ll be back soon .
That &apos;s all we know .
Why do you do that ?
We &apos;re going out .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is .
Tom knows exactly what he needs to do .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word out of you .
Tom looked like a doctor .
Tom and Mary have everything they need .
Tom seems to know exactly what he &apos;s doing .
I don &apos;t understand what he said .
I had no idea where I was .
We were just friends .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve met Tom .
Tom asked Mary how she was doing .
I had to do everything alone .
That &apos;s my car .
There &apos;s a car coming .
This car is mine .
There &apos;s been an accident .
It &apos;s a lot of fun to listen to music .
We live together .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
I wanted to talk about it .
Who gave this to you ?
Is Mary your daughter ?
Why is Tom looking at me ?
Tom loves me and I love him , too .
I will stay until tomorrow .
We probably don &apos;t have enough time to finish doing that today .
Tom knew that the story wasn &apos;t true .
What &apos;s your opinion on that ?
Tom has more money than I do .
We can &apos;t even be sure Tom is in Boston .
You must eat something .
He will wait .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
He lives with his mother .
If Tom had seen anything , he would have told us .
We don &apos;t have anything to eat .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;d like to stay for one night .
Please come over here .
He comes to see me once in a while .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
Why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
Are you rich ?
Tom seems quite happy .
I &apos;m only thinking of you .
What would Tom say if he were here ?
What is it that you want me to do now ?
Where does this book go ?
I wanted to help Tom understand what Mary was trying to tell him .
We study French .
There is always something to do .
I &apos;d better be on my way .
You aren &apos;t alone .
Can you hear us ?
It &apos;s cold .
We probably shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Do you know about this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to eat much .
We &apos;ll meet right here .
When did you become friends ?
I &apos;m home .
Are you still at home ?
I think I can help Tom with his homework .
Tom seemed surprised by this .
Tom speaks French better than English .
Tom will be here next week .
I know you can make it better .
I must know the truth about Tom .
You can do better than this .
Tom is very tired .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom about anything .
It &apos;s too short .
We lost a lot of time .
How many days are there in a week ?
You don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom said he didn &apos;t learn anything at school today .
I already know that .
I don &apos;t think I can do anything else .
He hasn &apos;t been able to come because he is sick .
Why is Tom in Boston ?
I &apos;ve got a good idea .
Don &apos;t play with me .
You &apos;ll love this .
I am not a doctor .
I don &apos;t like French .
This wouldn &apos;t be about Tom , would it ?
Tom comes to visit us every now and then .
Tom never came .
They bought a new car .
Tom is going to be there , too .
I wish I was young again .
Tom will speak .
Tom knows you &apos;re here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know a thing about me .
Tom came to see you this afternoon .
Tom is coming to see me .
I wish I could speak English .
I knew that was Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
Tom had nothing to read .
I don &apos;t have anything to do now .
I haven &apos;t really told you anything you shouldn &apos;t have already known .
This is the house where he was born .
Are you sure you can do this ?
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
Tom made tea for me .
What are you and Tom doing ?
I can &apos;t just not do anything . I have to do something .
He can only speak a little English .
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe it .
We &apos;re coming for you .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name ?
We have been together for a year .
That &apos;s hard to say .
Tom wanted to speak with Mary .
I love Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary .
What is the weather like today ?
How can you eat so much ?
It isn &apos;t difficult to speak French .
I know you have to go back to Boston .
What do they think it said ?
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
We need more food .
What &apos;s Tom want ?
I went to bed very late .
I know something Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Tom is like a brother to me .
What time will you get to the station ?
I don &apos;t think we want to know .
I can &apos;t remember everyone .
No one knows anything .
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
I really don &apos;t know him .
We &apos;ll never forget that .
Let &apos;s just have some fun .
Did you finish your homework ?
What do you want here ?
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
Is someone here ?
I know almost nothing about you .
Are you surprised that I came ?
You &apos;ll have a hard time .
I asked Tom to do that .
Tom likes him .
The night &apos;s still young .
He &apos;s already a man .
Tom stopped reading .
It &apos;s work .
Where &apos;s your family , Tom ?
I was just going to leave home .
There was nothing we could have done .
Have you had dinner ?
I &apos;m busy today .
I look like my father .
Did Tom , by any chance , let Mary drive the car ?
Can I have something to eat ?
Tom looked cold .
We had a lot of fun together .
Tom asked Mary where the dog was .
What time is the last train ?
I don &apos;t know what that thing is .
We have to do this .
I would like something to drink .
You won &apos;t believe it .
He goes to school by bicycle .
Why do you ask that ?
I got you something .
It &apos;s there .
I know nothing about it .
Your mother loves me .
How does he go to school ?
I feel very sorry about that .
You &apos;ll do great .
I think I ate a little too much today .
We can &apos;t go back there .
No one knows where he lives .
I see what the problem is .
Do you have money ?
Tom asked us to help him .
It is better for you to do it now .
What do they want us to do ?
No one could see us .
That wouldn &apos;t have happened here .
Get word to Tom .
That &apos;s all .
How &apos;re they doing that ?
What was the question ?
Tom and I are still friends .
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
No one wanted to be seen with Tom .
It might be too late .
I can speak English .
Are you free tomorrow ?
I could have bought that for you .
We &apos;re working .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what kind of person Mary is .
She doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
You &apos;re in my way .
I wonder what has become of his sister .
We want to see Tom .
I love old books .
Do you know something about this ?
Tom no longer lives with his parents .
I want to see this .
I saw him .
We &apos;re here for you .
Why does Tom want to be a teacher ?
He is a good doctor .
Tom is probably going to be tired when he gets home .
Tom was my teacher .
What he says is true .
I think Tom knows why .
Tom wants to study French .
Tom didn &apos;t say a thing .
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
I have a lot of money .
I was good .
Thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
Don &apos;t ask me what that is .
Tom knows that everything Mary is saying is true .
Tom has to go see Mary .
You &apos;ve gone too far .
I &apos;ll give you money .
What did you buy ?
What are you going to do with that ?
I don &apos;t like that name .
Why do we need to learn this ?
We will be happy to help .
I &apos;m sorry I said that .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
You &apos;re big enough to do that by yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m really tired and want to go to bed early .
I want a book .
I &apos;m happy for Tom .
Tom looked around to make sure they were alone .
Tom comes to school by bus and train .
No one has ever said such things to me .
What Tom said is right .
Tom has something in his hand .
We &apos;ll speak to Tom later .
He is far from rich .
Tom and I are fine .
Can you remember the first time we met each other ?
Do you have it ?
Have you talked to Tom about this ?
Tom found me a good job .
Is that what you think ?
I &apos;m not going back .
It was her that told me .
I &apos;ve said too much .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
We should try and get some sleep .
This made me think of you .
You &apos;ll feel better tomorrow , I promise .
I came with Tom .
Tom is a lot better at it than I am .
What does it say ?
I can &apos;t even remember what his name was .
How can this be possible ?
Can you help us ?
They don &apos;t like you .
I need to show you something .
What are we to do ?
What is your name ?
Tom will never see you again .
Tom and I have both been to Boston .
Tom can &apos;t work tonight .
Thank you for your help .
You have no idea how to do this , do you ?
It may already be too late for him .
Tom didn &apos;t give me my money back .
I &apos;m back .
She did it for her children .
You don &apos;t want to go to Boston , do you ?
Nobody here does that .
We have a plan .
My mother took me to the park .
I don &apos;t want them .
I can do this .
They lost .
I like being alone .
I haven &apos;t eaten .
I can give it a try .
What &apos;ll you have to drink ?
She doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Tom and Mary both have very few friends .
He &apos;s after me .
Tom turned the music off .
Tom wasn &apos;t here .
Don &apos;t you know what this is ?
We know everything you know .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
I really want to know what &apos;s going on here .
Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
Let Tom stay .
Tom saw Mary at the station .
I wasn &apos;t the only person Tom talked to .
Why do you say things like that ?
I made a lot of mistakes .
Tom is in the car .
I think I know what this is .
I saw a man with a child .
It &apos;s hard to believe .
Tom is going to help us .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a month .
Do you have some money ?
Tom is a high school student .
I have some reading to do .
I &apos;m not thinking about it .
It has to be true .
I can swim .
How did you like that movie ?
Can you do this ?
I can tell you where to find Tom .
I &apos;m going to take Tom home .
Let &apos;s go tomorrow afternoon .
I want something else .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be very happy together .
Your French is really good . Where did you study ?
They wouldn &apos;t have done anything .
I &apos;m happy with this .
There is one thing that I don &apos;t understand .
My mother is a good woman .
Tom has never been late for school .
I need you to help me .
You aren &apos;t one of us .
She doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
Tom took a look around the room .
Tom saw Mary doing that .
I &apos;ll be free all day tomorrow .
When were you born ?
Tom says he &apos;s too tired today to help us .
What more can I do ?
I don &apos;t know whether to tell Tom or not .
Tom asked Mary about her job in Boston .
The weather is bad today .
I have to be in Boston by Monday .
I don &apos;t like you anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t a good student .
Let &apos;s write a book .
That &apos;s our house .
You think I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
You don &apos;t want that .
What did Tom just say to you ?
Tom is very good at it .
Tom wants it .
I was tired .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
Tom is living with his parents .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that .
Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
She went out of the room .
I read your letter yesterday .
You drive too fast .
Keep the door closed .
Mary told me that she was glad to see me .
Is there anybody who can drive a car ?
They don &apos;t want you to know .
Tom isn &apos;t my son .
They &apos;ll understand .
I will not see him any more .
I think this is good for us .
Tom looks like John .
That has nothing to do with me .
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
I know them .
Tom couldn &apos;t find Mary .
Tom wants to do that .
I &apos;d like to see Tom .
Could you help me ?
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom is .
He didn &apos;t show up at the party last night .
Nobody can know everything .
I &apos;ve never seen anyone like you .
Tom told me he was glad to see me .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
I don &apos;t want to see you here again .
I know you know .
You &apos;ve found something .
Tom needs the money right away .
I &apos;ve lost .
What happened then ?
Are there any questions ?
Who did it ?
I don &apos;t understand this country .
The problem was very difficult .
Give me that book .
He knows my wife .
What do you think Tom wants ?
We aren &apos;t going .
He left the book on the table .
I know you want to be rich .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat much .
All we need is water .
Tom , I &apos;m happy for you .
I wish I could do more .
I &apos;m not going with you .
I don &apos;t understand a word of what he says .
I &apos;ll be in my car .
When will you finish your work ?
Have you finished reading the book ?
Tom says he &apos;ll come .
Is this for me ?
Tom , where are we ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I see the boy .
Tom tried to sleep .
Tom is young , but he knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom wants to work in a hospital .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is happy or not .
I &apos;ll come alone .
She is not young .
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room .
We have nothing else .
I think you know what I think .
How long have you lived here ?
If I get rich , I will buy it .
We &apos;re too late .
Tom will be in his office all afternoon .
Tom hasn &apos;t done his homework yet .
I like it .
I &apos;ll give these to Tom .
I have to leave you .
Tom knew it was wrong to do what he did .
Tom can &apos;t seem to understand what Mary is trying to say .
We didn &apos;t get far .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
You &apos;ll do no such thing .
Do it yourself .
Could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
We &apos;ll see you .
Let &apos;s go for a drink .
I need to talk to him .
I think you should see a doctor .
Tom is just going to need some time .
I have no time to read books .
He &apos;s your father .
Tom gave me his word .
What &apos;s this dog &apos;s name ?
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
I didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know how to drive .
Tom has to finish this work by 2 : 30 .
Who &apos;s the girl at the door ?
Where are we now ?
She asked him how to get to the station .
I feel a lot better today .
As it is , I can do nothing .
I am not like you .
How &apos;s Tom today ?
Why do you think that ?
I think I like it .
How long ago was it ?
That &apos;s how we do things .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
I know what you are thinking .
I &apos;m happy to hear that .
I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;ll help .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary here ?
I &apos;d love to visit Boston .
She needs him more than he needs her .
Tom knows what he wants to say .
Don &apos;t give up like that .
It &apos;s not Monday .
No one is going to understand you .
Tom was in Australia last month , wasn &apos;t he ?
I need money .
I would never say such a thing .
I want to stay longer .
Tom stopped talking when Mary came into the room .
I don &apos;t really think so .
That &apos;ll just have to wait until next week .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
I was trying to find Tom .
I know you don &apos;t remember me .
We can wait .
What did I just do ?
No one was in the car .
Tom isn &apos;t going to drive the children to school tomorrow .
She was making tea .
I think Tom should go .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s always right .
You look very happy this morning .
You are late .
I &apos;m doing what I want to do .
It &apos;s true .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
In a word , life is short .
I like Tom , too .
I went to the police .
It &apos;s for Tom .
What are they up to ?
Tom should wait .
Tom isn &apos;t watching .
What &apos;ve you got ?
Tom &apos;s not busy .
I do think I understand .
What does that have to do with us ?
I must know the truth about him .
Please don &apos;t speak French here .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
Tom , I &apos;m doing this for you .
You &apos;re always around .
We &apos;ll do all we can .
It &apos;s not too late to do that .
That was all Tom said .
Tom says he &apos;s fine .
Why didn &apos;t you show up at the party last night ?
Tom says he &apos;s not coming .
I love my son .
It &apos;s too hard .
Everyone says that he &apos;s a good man .
She gave him the car .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
Are you saying you don &apos;t want to go ?
Tom looks rich .
Can I go to bed now ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to see it .
Tom told me he was cold .
They believe you .
What do they want with Tom ?
My parents don &apos;t understand me .
I have to get to school .
Mary is my mother .
I &apos;m being good to you this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was from Boston .
You said it yourself .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
What you say is right .
Tom made me do the work .
I have no idea what the weather will be like tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know anything about her .
She asked him to stay , but he had to go to work .
I was late for work this morning .
I &apos;ll go with Tom and Mary .
May I talk to you ?
I could never be like you .
I &apos;d like to play tennis .
I could learn something from you , I think .
Tom was late for dinner .
Get off of Tom .
The boy takes after his father .
I thought it would be a good idea .
This is really important .
It &apos;s not for you .
Is this the train station ?
They can &apos;t believe it .
Tom &apos;s new book is about Mary .
I don &apos;t know how to say what I want to say in French .
All you need to do is wait .
I want to know what this is called .
Why is Tom out here ?
Why don &apos;t you go in my place ?
What goes on in this room ?
It could be Tom .
Tom knows I &apos;m here .
I don &apos;t see it .
I want to know why you &apos;re here .
I won &apos;t forget that .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
How is everyone ?
I can speak French .
Why should Tom visit Boston ?
Tom is doing fine .
How long were you at school today ?
I saw Tom play tennis .
You never told me you had a sister .
That won &apos;t be easy .
Do we have time ?
I had a very good time today .
He quickly went out of the room .
This is my city now .
Did he go to see Mary ?
He will come tomorrow .
You can &apos;t do that .
I wish I could stay longer .
We shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me ?
This is too easy for him .
Tom could &apos;ve and should &apos;ve helped Mary .
I &apos;m not over thirty years old .
Tom doesn &apos;t have tea .
Did they say why ?
She seems rich .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t need to know about this .
That &apos;s how I know .
Tom wants to be rich .
We &apos;ve got time .
If you really don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
I want us to be together .
Who told you I would help you ?
She can &apos;t stop talking .
I should &apos;ve talked to Tom first .
Tom has already eaten dinner .
They understand now .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word about it !
Tom lost again .
You can use this car .
Tom is in the room .
Tom wanted to learn how to swim .
I &apos;ll see you on Monday in Boston .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know the truth .
Tom is coming for dinner . Do you want to stay ?
Tom just bought a car , too .
Tom will be thirty this year .
He is not wearing a hat .
I must get back to my work .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s quite true .
You look a bit better today .
Tom was alone in the room .
Where did you learn that ?
Do you want me to make coffee ?
I know what Tom wants .
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
There is a cat .
Tell Tom yourself .
I can tell this has been difficult for you .
I don &apos;t think he will come .
Please come back at once .
Tom is one person I &apos;ll never forget .
His family didn &apos;t have much money .
Is this Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom and Mary are both happy .
We &apos;ve got to stop meeting like this .
The question is how he will get the money .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
May I ask how old you are ?
We study French at school .
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom again .
I wonder where Tom has gone .
We know Tom is here .
He said that if he were there , he would help her .
Tom knows how to swim .
They need new shoes .
Are we good to go ?
Mary is Tom &apos;s only daughter .
Do you remember what you were watching ?
You can do that tomorrow .
I want to say I &apos;m sorry .
What &apos;re we doing here ?
I like him .
I thought Tom had a dog .
Are you happy in your house ?
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Where are we right now ?
Who &apos;s there ?
Thank you for coming to see me .
Tom looked busy .
Tell him to wait .
We have to do it together .
He has come !
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
I like to do that .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what he was going to say .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
I know what Tom needs to do .
Nobody saw me .
My parents are in Australia .
Tom was very rich .
I will read a book .
Did you speak to Tom yesterday ?
This thing isn &apos;t over yet .
You shouldn &apos;t go to school .
There was another problem .
We &apos;re a long way from home .
That &apos;s what I love about you , Tom .
I haven &apos;t even told my wife .
This is my brother .
How big is this park ?
I really wish I could help .
I wanted to do something for Tom .
We should go to the party together .
Nobody tried to help Tom .
I can still remember that day .
We don &apos;t have time for this .
I have one .
You are everything to me .
You can go if you want .
I want to go .
Did you find Tom or not ?
I think Tom wants to see you .
Does Tom have a problem with that ?
Tom may know why Mary has to do that .
There &apos;s something about Tom that I don &apos;t like .
Tom may have seen it .
Tom was at home alone .
I want him to leave .
You have everything .
All my friends like Tom .
Tom is going to like doing that .
Tom says Mary likes you .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
A few days later , he came .
Do you want to see ?
I like it , too .
Tom never told me where he lived .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom is .
She bought him a dog .
That &apos;s what I said .
She lives in the country .
You &apos;ll get your money .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
These are my friends .
I want to do it again .
I &apos;ve already told Tom all I know .
Tom is able to speak French .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary had already done that .
You have to see this .
We can help you .
Tom couldn &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
We must find them .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like me .
Tom had a lot to do .
Tom didn &apos;t even know I was here .
She is beautiful .
This is Tom &apos;s sister .
That &apos;s not what Tom said .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like this .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Thank you for the book .
What does Tom know about this ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
I don &apos;t want to live like this .
I won &apos;t work with him .
I have many friends .
I don &apos;t know if it is true .
Tom can &apos;t sing as well as Mary .
It &apos;s that time again already .
The question is who will do it .
I &apos;d love to live in Boston .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
Tom may not want to do that , but he should .
Tom &apos;s coming .
Don &apos;t come into my room .
Is that a boy or a girl ?
I thought that would be a great idea .
I &apos;ll read this book .
She asked me how old I was .
It &apos;s important .
Tom had questions .
I couldn &apos;t help myself .
You should read this .
Could you do that , Tom ?
Tom may be there .
Tom is in your car .
I think I won &apos;t do that .
Give me those .
What we do is up to you .
He would often come to see me .
Could you leave us alone ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll have enough time .
There &apos;s no mistake .
Please keep on working even when I &apos;m not here .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been sick .
Give me the watch .
How did you get so good at French ?
Tom walked over to the desk .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
I don &apos;t like what I see .
I think Tom is old .
Tell Tom that I &apos;d like to help .
You did a really good job .
We &apos;re about the same age .
I knew you would come .
How do you do it ?
We met that night .
All of us want to live as long as possible .
You don &apos;t need to come so early .
Tom does love you .
Please don &apos;t let go of my hand .
Tom told me that he was cold .
Is that where Tom is ?
It &apos;ll all be over soon .
I need Tom &apos;s help .
I &apos;d like to help , but I can &apos;t .
Can you tell me the way to the station ?
I was on the bus .
We found it .
You need to leave .
I know Tom is in love with Mary .
Why should Tom sing ?
We want to help Tom .
You know what they say about Tom .
You can do anything you want to .
Is Tom there alone ?
He is angry with me .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so happy .
I will show you the picture .
What were you doing at Tom &apos;s house ?
Do you know where your children are ?
We &apos;re going with you .
It &apos;s really cold today .
How do we find it ?
Tom might wait .
Let &apos;s talk about this later .
He &apos;s my father .
You asked for our help .
I am pretty sure .
Don &apos;t you know what happened yesterday ?
I gave Tom my word .
Let &apos;s see if Tom is in his office .
I have a lot of friends here .
Where were they ?
We found them here .
The boy was tired .
Can it wait ?
You are better than me .
Maybe I should stop now .
There is one problem .
I want what you want .
There &apos;s been no one here .
We &apos;re having fun .
Tom came to live here .
What does this have to do with Tom ?
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary .
Why is everyone looking at me ?
Tom has done that for three years .
You should &apos;ve told me yesterday .
We &apos;re very worried about you .
What &apos;s going on out here ?
There &apos;s something on the table .
I &apos;d like to see someone do better .
We have already finished our dinner .
Tom must be tired .
I &apos;m happy for Tom and Mary .
I will be free tomorrow afternoon .
Is this your cat ?
I understand that Tom does that .
The time will come when you will know the truth .
Tom had a lot of things to do .
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak English .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary drive him home .
I hope so , too .
Tom and I both need help .
I thought Tom was sick .
I met him while he was in Japan .
I can &apos;t understand what he is trying to say .
They have nothing to eat .
I want to be sure .
Where &apos;s our car ?
Why is Tom even here ?
I &apos;m not quite sure yet .
That &apos;s my sister .
Is Tom with Mary ?
Tom likes being at home .
Tom likes music .
I &apos;ve got something you both need .
What do you want from Tom ?
Is Tom here ?
I thought Tom lived in Boston .
My daughter went to school .
Tom knows exactly what he wants .
Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight .
I think Tom can help you .
I &apos;m going to need you later .
Tom had to wait .
Tom and I work together .
He had a lot of things to do .
I think it &apos;s a good thing .
What do you and Tom want to do ?
I think Tom speaks French well .
I &apos;ll be back late tonight .
Tom said you &apos;d do that for Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t old enough to understand this .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
He is having dinner .
I think now is the time .
Why are you talking like that ?
Tom speaks French well , but not as well as he speaks English .
What do you do after work ?
Tom finished .
Do you know where Boston is ?
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that tomorrow .
This is a picture .
I &apos;m not well .
This is going to be fun .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
I can &apos;t sing .
It &apos;s what I like .
Tom is here again .
It &apos;s close to my house .
I just gave Tom 30 dollars .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I don &apos;t want to go there again .
I need your help , Tom .
Tom heard that .
She can &apos;t have done such a thing .
Would you like it now ?
I &apos;m coming to you .
We can &apos;t wait .
It &apos;s so nice to be back .
What &apos;s wrong with you , Tom ?
I have seen that girl before .
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear me .
I want to stay here with you .
What are you doing up ?
You look very beautiful today .
What they told you is not true .
It &apos;ll have to wait .
Tom asked Mary who her father was .
Do you remember when Tom said that ?
I believe Tom knows .
Tom said Mary would come .
I know just what you need .
I &apos;m home , Tom .
Tom gave it back to Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t stop talking .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you ever again .
Your shoes are here .
He did it for money .
I plan to never drink again .
It &apos;s not the end of the world .
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
I &apos;m tired and I want to go to bed .
They know what &apos;s going on .
What else did Tom eat ?
You have to tell me the truth .
Who is that man ?
He was not happy at all .
That &apos;s not bad .
How are we going to get home ?
The truth is that I don &apos;t really love you anymore .
Where &apos;s your car , Tom ?
What do you think they want ?
She took my hand .
Tom has a lot of money now .
Tom has been found .
Tom isn &apos;t in this picture .
I don &apos;t know who that boy is .
There &apos;s too much I don &apos;t know .
I was surprised Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done any better .
Why do you think I came ?
I &apos;ll never leave you alone again .
This river is beautiful .
Tom gave Mary everything .
I &apos;m not the problem .
I wish Tom would come to Boston .
Tom got better .
I know what you mean .
It &apos;s not this one .
Why do we have to help Tom ?
We just don &apos;t know why .
Who bought you this ?
I &apos;ll probably never do that again .
I am tired of my work .
He got up early this morning .
Tom asked me to talk with you .
I only saw Tom once .
It was hard to believe .
I am happy .
How do you feel about it ?
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
I do not understand her .
Why not talk it over with your teacher ?
Tom was here .
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened .
This makes me very happy .
Why are we even talking about this ?
Do you think English is difficult ?
I do not know anything about him .
That was the answer I wanted .
I think he is right .
I don &apos;t really want to stop .
I thought about you .
Let me help you with that .
This is the big one .
Why isn &apos;t Tom happy ?
Who stopped ?
Have you ever seen Tom do that before ?
I can &apos;t drive Tom to school today .
Where is the train ?
You aren &apos;t from around here , are you ?
Tom can &apos;t be under thirty .
I don &apos;t quite know yet .
Do you know who he was ?
Tom knows what we did .
We sure had fun , didn &apos;t we ?
We should study together .
I want you out here .
Did you speak with Tom ?
Tom was in the hospital .
I can find my own way out .
I want to live .
Do you have a girlfriend now ?
It &apos;s really not a good idea .
We did that yesterday .
It &apos;s just a cat .
Tom was with me .
That &apos;s all we know for sure .
She &apos;s busy .
Tom came too early .
Tom told me to give you this .
Are those new shoes ?
Tom should go help Mary .
The door won &apos;t open .
I &apos;m ready to go .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
He will be free tomorrow .
It is something my mother made .
It looks like Tom likes his new job .
Tom is about as old as Mary is .
What do you think of this plan ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know that .
Tom does what he &apos;s told .
Tom was home all night .
If you don &apos;t want to talk to me , you don &apos;t have to .
I know a lot about you .
You are in my way .
He was sick last week .
Who wrote this story ?
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
It doesn &apos;t always happen .
Did Tom say who did it ?
I don &apos;t know how long .
You know too much .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
We really have to go back to Boston .
What don &apos;t I understand ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston yet .
I still don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom was angry with his son .
This isn &apos;t the first time Tom has been late .
I don &apos;t like the coffee .
I already have a girlfriend .
Tell me what you see .
Tom is going to be very good .
Tom and Mary both can &apos;t swim .
I don &apos;t like anything .
That should be possible .
My father has a lot of books .
Who can speak French better , Tom or Mary ?
Why do you have that ?
Tom &apos;ll help .
These aren &apos;t yours , are they ?
Where did he learn this ?
I don &apos;t have anything to read .
He may have been right .
I have to go back to work now .
I know what your name is .
When are you coming back to the office ?
Don &apos;t keep saying you &apos;re sorry .
You can &apos;t eat here .
Why aren &apos;t you there ?
I &apos;m going to my sister &apos;s .
The girl doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
Where can I buy books ?
You &apos;ll get well soon .
My daughter is still at work .
You still have a lot to learn .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything .
They aren &apos;t that good .
Tom knows Boston well .
We know what needs to be done .
I know too much .
This is Tom &apos;s bicycle .
How do I do it ?
Tom said that was the first time he &apos;d ever done that .
What do you know about Tom &apos;s family ?
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
He himself did it .
You know how Tom is .
What &apos;s your older sister &apos;s name ?
We &apos;re not going with you .
Tom has already done a lot for us .
Tom will come with me .
Tom is all right .
You alone can help me .
Tom works in Boston .
I want to hear you say it .
I lost everything .
Where have you been , Tom ?
That isn &apos;t enough .
Tom has a little money .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
I &apos;m sure Tom told you .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
What school did you go to ?
Have you read this book already ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
We &apos;ll be there .
Don &apos;t you want to study ?
I think he doesn &apos;t like it here .
We are going to meet him tonight .
I go to bed very early .
It doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
Tom seemed happy .
Let &apos;s go see Tom .
How am I going to do that ?
We &apos;ll bring Tom .
Tom says he met my father .
I met your friend .
I will give you the money tomorrow .
She doesn &apos;t want him to go to Boston .
There are too many things to do !
Did he tell you anything ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether what Mary says is true or not .
I wish I &apos;d thought of that .
This work is difficult for us .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car yet .
What else can you do ?
I haven &apos;t seen you in a long time .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
I do not know where to wait for her .
What do you do with your money ?
What is it you really want to tell me ?
That &apos;s the one .
Tom is a very good teacher .
Tom is exactly like his father .
If Tom can &apos;t tell me , then no one can .
That can wait until later .
I don &apos;t see why everyone thinks this book is so good .
Tom said something , but I couldn &apos;t hear what he said .
It &apos;s too soon .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
Tom was waiting for you .
That &apos;s all I saw .
He just arrived .
I think this is the way to do it .
He went to school by car .
This is Tom &apos;s book .
That &apos;s just what Tom needs .
I can &apos;t believe I did that .
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
We don &apos;t know whether to believe Tom or not .
He speaks English well .
I should &apos;ve said that .
We &apos;d better stop .
Have you read the book Tom bought for you ?
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
I asked Tom a lot of questions .
Tom asked me for something I couldn &apos;t give him .
It was for Tom .
She has a new man in her life .
I don &apos;t like it when you &apos;re so busy .
Why are you here ?
This is the boy I met there yesterday .
Can I eat in my room ?
I did everything right .
I met Tom yesterday .
She has been busy since yesterday .
Who is your teacher ?
Tom wants to know why Mary didn &apos;t go to school today .
I know how busy Tom is .
It &apos;s as good as finished .
I &apos;ll stand .
Tom wanted to be rich .
How &apos;s Tom tonight ?
I didn &apos;t say it was going to be easy .
Tom and I often work together .
You must stay the night .
Tom doesn &apos;t know .
I didn &apos;t know exactly what to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I don &apos;t want to do his work for him .
I don &apos;t want to talk .
How did you get into my house ?
Tom told me what you did .
What were you doing that moment ?
Who lives in this house ?
This story cannot be true .
What &apos;s the name of this river ?
I don &apos;t know much about Australia .
I can &apos;t eat all this .
I &apos;d like to study French .
This is Tom &apos;s school .
If you can , come with us .
What do you want to see ?
I can &apos;t drink any more beer .
I know everything about Tom .
I &apos;m going to see Tom today .
What are we going to do about Tom ?
Tom could do it .
I don &apos;t see a problem .
Why are you so busy today ?
Is this your letter ?
What does that have to do with it ?
Tom is going to be with Mary .
We have no idea what to do .
He &apos;s already too far away to hear us .
No one will believe them .
I will be with you right away .
Is it cold outside ?
I would like to drink a coffee .
I &apos;ve only been to Boston once .
What is it that you want to know ?
I ate too much today .
This is the problem .
Do you want me to come ?
Is it far from here ?
I know Tom better than he knows himself .
I was angry .
What did you do yesterday ?
I &apos;m very busy today .
I don &apos;t know what to do anymore .
Do you know what I mean ?
Tom knows what he likes .
He bought a car .
You &apos;re after me .
I &apos;m here to have fun .
Tom had no idea why Mary wanted to see him .
I think we &apos;ll go with you .
What will you do with your money ?
That &apos;s how we did it .
I &apos;ll talk with you when you &apos;re not busy .
I can &apos;t tell Tom that .
Give me your money .
That will not be possible .
This is my friend .
Tom , are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
Did you enjoy that ?
Is Tom in the hospital ?
Don &apos;t give in .
Tom looked happy .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
Please come .
Do they live with you ?
I don &apos;t care what Tom does .
Come back .
I still want to talk to you .
How does Tom do that ?
I know you can do this .
I &apos;m a little cold .
We &apos;ll see to it later .
When was the last time you bought shoes ?
I don &apos;t like this game .
Tom asked for my advice .
You &apos;ll see Tom .
Did you really talk to Tom ?
I know you &apos;ll like Tom .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
I need to know everything there is to know about Tom .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know you .
Don &apos;t do it !
Let &apos;s go !
Why do they do this ?
Tom and I want to get married .
I think Tom could do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money .
They haven &apos;t come back home yet .
I &apos;m coming back home by bus .
How did he come here ?
I like being with you .
What have you been doing all this while ?
Tom , can you come tomorrow ?
You are a friend of Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom said Mary is ready .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
Do you not know who I am ?
He loves music .
May I go with Tom ?
Let &apos;s all go to Boston together .
What &apos;ll you have for dinner tonight ?
Tom asked me to give you something .
He &apos;s looking good .
Can you make room for me ?
I don &apos;t want to see it .
We need a car big enough for the whole family .
Give it to me !
That can &apos;t be Tom .
What my mother had said was true .
Tom wanted to see it .
Do you want to know who I am ?
How about tomorrow ?
Tom has gone home .
I want Mary .
Who saw what ?
I &apos;ve just read this book .
Where is my dog ?
I gave Tom a book .
Tom does all his homework at school .
We can &apos;t trust what she says .
I just want to get some sleep .
What else did you do there ?
My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English .
I wish Tom could be here with us today .
I &apos;d like to work in Australia .
Tom likes it there .
The dinner is almost ready .
My son is ten years old .
This is their house .
That wasn &apos;t Tom .
It &apos;s good to have you with us .
Why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
That has something to do with this problem .
She is only a child .
Tom wants to go by train .
What time do you go home ?
That &apos;s what people say .
We don &apos;t have enough food .
You &apos;ve been very good to me .
Tom is in the park .
I wasn &apos;t ready .
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary .
He is working on the new plan .
That was a mistake .
Have you seen my sister ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time .
I &apos;m not very happy here .
Tom does have to do that .
I think you worry too much , Tom .
Mary and I are getting married .
Tom likes her .
Tom is in Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
I think I made a mistake .
I would like to tell you something .
I &apos;ve had a busy day .
I wish you had not told the story to my mother .
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
Tom made it easy for me .
We can do much better .
Tom &apos;s shoes are under his bed .
We &apos;re not friends anymore .
I want this to be yours .
He asked for the money .
I &apos;ll ask him how the accident happened .
I really want to be a good teacher .
I am sure I saw her two years ago .
Tom was here yesterday .
He seems to have been sick last week .
He can read .
Do it at once .
Tom loves it .
Tom often comes to Boston .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
Tom said he &apos;d be right back .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
I want my children to learn to speak French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
Who found him ?
Where did it happen ?
What have we here ?
Tom and I became very good friends .
We know what Tom wants .
Tom has been here for quite a long time .
Is it always cold like this ?
Tom didn &apos;t go to work all last week .
He finished reading the book .
I had nothing to do with that .
I will go .
They &apos;ve done it before .
Nobody came to work this morning .
Tom is as big as I am .
I haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .
Tom , I &apos;m home .
Tom is coming to Boston .
I think I understand you .
I don &apos;t think I know the answer .
Tom is going to do this .
Can &apos;t we just be friends ?
Tom seems to know a lot about me .
Tom and Mary just bought a new car .
Tell us why you &apos;re here .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
She was alone there .
I went to the park yesterday .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
Tom knows what &apos;s coming .
Tell me what I should &apos;ve done .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom that he didn &apos;t have to come .
I need Tom now .
Tom could do that .
I want to come home .
What were Tom and Mary thinking ?
Can you show me ?
Tom and Mary are my friends .
I want to do this .
I can &apos;t meet Tom now .
I don &apos;t really understand French .
I don &apos;t want you .
I am not well at all .
I can &apos;t live like this anymore .
We &apos;ll have a great time .
I don &apos;t have a family .
Tell me it isn &apos;t true .
I &apos;ll never be young again .
She doesn &apos;t do anything else .
I thought you &apos;d never visit us again .
There comes our teacher .
Tom wants to see that .
Tom needs it .
Tom may be up .
Tom says it &apos;s important .
Tom is no longer a boy .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
Who &apos;s that ?
You must study more .
This is not for me .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher .
I don &apos;t know why Tom and Mary don &apos;t like each other .
Is Tom happy ?
Did she say it ?
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Thank you for your advice .
Tom gave Mary a book .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have enough money .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have a lot of money .
We can do better than that .
When did you meet her ?
That &apos;s what I like .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing here .
Tom says he isn &apos;t happy .
I want Tom to see this .
You &apos;re too good for Tom .
It &apos;s been ten years since we last met .
The question is where to buy the book .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
We didn &apos;t do anything .
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
You won &apos;t believe this .
I tried to help him .
The boy has no food .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will come .
My father gave me a watch , but I lost it .
What books have you read in French ?
Could you please say that once again in French ?
No one wants to talk to Tom anymore .
This is Tom &apos;s dog .
Tom and Mary usually go to school by bicycle .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t need to .
Tom has a family now .
Where &apos;s the train station ?
This was no accident .
Tom is better .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary .
Tom is quite old .
Tom does want to do that .
I only hope it is not too late .
I can &apos;t tell you how sorry I am .
It &apos;s up to you .
You should &apos;ve done it yourself .
Tom made his bed .
We &apos;re going to get that .
I &apos;ll be done in five minutes .
This isn &apos;t good for Tom .
Tom wanted to learn to swim .
What did she say ?
Tom and Mary are out .
Tom is very rich , isn &apos;t he ?
Why don &apos;t you and Tom do it ?
Tom may not know .
Is that all you want to say ?
Tom likes to show off .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Tom wanted to talk to me about something .
I told Tom that his French was easy to understand .
We can talk about that later .
When did you find this ?
Tom hasn &apos;t got much money with him .
I &apos;d like to say something .
She was surprised that it was that late .
I &apos;ve found a job .
I feel like I &apos;ve already seen this movie .
Tom stopped eating .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is here .
It &apos;s not a watch .
Would you tell me the time , please ?
I can &apos;t remember why I did that .
I &apos;m going to be fine .
Tom had to go himself .
That &apos;s very , very good .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;s coming .
She did not come until two .
I want to visit Boston , too .
He did it right away .
He wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
Have you already tried not thinking of anything ?
You &apos;re going to be so happy here .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
I did what I was told .
Who gave this to Tom ?
You should have stayed in the car .
I wish I had more money with me .
I remember reading that book .
I think you know what to do .
We &apos;re not sure if she &apos;s right .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
Have you ever heard Tom sing ?
It is a good cake .
Tom and I are doing OK .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I don &apos;t need them .
We had a little water .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
I don &apos;t think I like you .
That was of great help to me .
We have to go .
I know Tom very well .
I can hardly remember Tom .
No one speaks with me .
I like my life .
We &apos;re a family .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
You &apos;re not going to like what I &apos;m about to say .
Do you know about that ?
Tom loves that .
My father is a doctor .
I want us to be friends .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
Tom is going to like this .
I should &apos;ve known better .
Tom said something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
Who told you about me ?
My sister can swim very fast .
Tom came to Japan from Australia .
I should just go home .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know what happened .
Who &apos;ll go ?
Give it to her .
I can &apos;t believe how beautiful you are .
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
Is that a lot ?
There is something I must know .
Could you please do that for me ?
She loves coffee .
What &apos;ll Tom do ?
Tom now lives in Australia .
When are they coming ?
I never saw her again .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this .
I &apos;ll come .
We didn &apos;t do a thing .
I have a brother in Boston .
I &apos;ve never heard of that city .
Tom asked me to give this to you .
Have you already eaten ?
The weather here is getting cold and I really do not like that .
Tom didn &apos;t know that .
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be anything else but a teacher .
Tom let us go .
What &apos;re you going to do with that ?
Tom walked back into the house .
Don &apos;t you want me there ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom is happy .
Tom is going to be back from Australia tomorrow .
I came to see you .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s brother .
You aren &apos;t very happy , are you ?
I don &apos;t think I like that .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know what to do .
They left without me .
They &apos;ll know .
If I were you , I &apos;d ask him .
We need to be more like Tom .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
He can &apos;t read it .
I have a large family .
Tom may go to Boston tomorrow .
This is a very new book .
This room is very cold .
He &apos;s right behind you .
I know her by name .
Are those for me ?
Could you do that tomorrow ?
What did Tom get ?
Give Tom what he wants .
Tom bought a hat .
I don &apos;t believe I &apos;ve heard that name .
Who is that ?
Tom is very rich .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
Tell Tom not to tell Mary .
Do you want to know ?
Are you home , too ?
When do you want to do this ?
Who is the man who was talking with you ?
Tom asked Mary many questions about Australia .
We don &apos;t have tea .
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
I don &apos;t want you to be here .
I think Tom may do that .
Did he come by bus or by train ?
You don &apos;t look sick to me .
It looks fine .
I think Tom is still in Boston .
Tom has done that .
Tom didn &apos;t want my help .
We must work as long as we live .
I want to drink tea .
Just let Tom go .
You look like a girl .
Tom has a thing for Mary .
What were you doing at that time ?
I do not care for him .
She seems to have been happy .
Do you want to play ?
They &apos;ll find us .
I don &apos;t want to ever see you again .
I don &apos;t understand a thing .
Are we sure about that ?
Do you want to make me happy ?
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d help her , but he didn &apos;t .
What does this have to do with school ?
I plan to speak with Tom about that .
Did you hear it too ?
This is what I want to do .
I wanted to show it to you .
What &apos;s this ?
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
What are they doing ?
I thought that you said you were bad at French .
He said nothing .
I can speak French better than Tom can .
Did you do it ?
I have homework .
They are very old .
What &apos;s going on out there ?
They &apos;re almost three times as big as we are .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure .
Tom did a lot more than that .
That car is mine .
Do you want to become a father ?
Is Tom alone now ?
I &apos;d like to see you this afternoon .
I want to come .
I couldn &apos;t remember anything .
Are you sure you want to do that ?
He died five years ago .
Tom isn &apos;t going to go with us .
Let &apos;s wait until Monday .
Why is it there ?
It was a little fun .
I &apos;m happy here .
Do it again , Tom .
I need to find someone who can help me .
Is it hard to speak English ?
I want to hear the whole story .
I know him only by name .
How do you like Australia ?
Tom knows where we live .
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this ?
Tom has already left .
Tom is the only one here who doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Can your brother drive a car ?
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you . Thank you .
I &apos;m behind you .
I &apos;d love to see them .
I did everything all by myself .
Tom seemed to be quite busy .
I think it &apos;s going to be fun .
I &apos;ll be with Tom on Monday .
Tom isn &apos;t eating .
Tom is himself again .
You are doing very well . Keep it up .
There &apos;s so much I want to show you .
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
I do not have any money .
I &apos;m not sure I want to do this .
Maybe I should write a letter to Tom .
I knew that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
We only want to help you , Tom .
It &apos;s time for our children to go to bed .
Tom didn &apos;t do any work .
It wasn &apos;t you , was it ?
I can &apos;t do anything .
Who told Tom that ?
I came yesterday .
I &apos;m right behind him .
How long &apos;s Tom been sick ?
Tom has no idea what to do .
What is he up to ?
We eat so that we can live .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary .
I have to go to Australia next month .
We plan to stay a week .
That &apos;s enough for today . I &apos;m tired .
Tom gave Mary a drink .
That could be a problem .
What was Tom doing in your room ?
I didn &apos;t feel cold .
Tom can &apos;t keep his eyes off Mary .
Do you have any water ?
We have to do it .
If you don &apos;t want to do that , it &apos;s OK .
I just told Tom .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell Mary how old he was .
She has a big family .
He speaks French .
I need only one cat .
When was the last time you saw your children ?
Tom likes Mary and Mary likes Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t well .
I think I &apos;m going to like this .
When are you going to come home ?
Tom can &apos;t forget Mary .
Tom is a very good person .
Mary is a mother .
Tom always does that for me .
Is the water cold ?
Tom was angry with himself .
Tom wants someone to love him .
She never told me she had a cat .
I think this is important .
They love coffee .
I don &apos;t think he is right .
I want to know who you are .
I got what I wanted .
What &apos;s it look like to you ?
She is getting better day by day .
I cannot eat anything today .
Tom knows exactly what kind of person Mary is .
Tom is going to love it here .
All of us like her .
He wanted to buy a book .
How is it going with you and Tom ?
My sister is three years old .
You are not our friend .
That was really fun .
It &apos;s about time for you to leave .
I hope not .
What should I tell Tom now ?
I knew it was too late .
It looks like Tom is done .
I &apos;m happy tonight .
She is in need of help .
My mother was up late last night .
What do I get out of it ?
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
Where am I now ?
No one left .
Tom wants to talk to you again .
I saw her again .
We &apos;re all going .
Are we all happy ?
Where do you want me ?
It &apos;s very cold now .
Tom and Mary are like that .
I know what you want to do .
Tom made Mary wait for a long time .
I don &apos;t know as many people as you do .
You should stay at home today .
That &apos;s how Tom did that .
How long has this been going on ?
I got here as fast as I could .
Do you have my money or not ?
Tom will do that again tomorrow .
I want to leave school .
You &apos;re not here .
I can &apos;t stay long today .
We don &apos;t want Tom to do that anymore .
I think we have to go .
He said to himself , &quot; I will do it . &quot;
That &apos;s the way Tom always does it .
I think I &apos;m going to stay here .
I &apos;ll stay at my sister &apos;s place .
Tom won &apos;t even look at me .
This book is yours .
Do you know what time it is ?
Tom and Mary want to learn French .
She can hardly speak .
Do it now , Tom .
I am 30 years old now .
It &apos;ll be over soon .
Tom &apos;s family is here .
Tom and Mary are going to give it a try .
I will not be busy tomorrow .
Tom will need help .
What else do you want me to do ?
Why do I have to talk to Tom ?
I &apos;ve got to talk to Tom .
How much money do you have on you ?
Mary was my first girlfriend .
Everyone does it .
I have to give Tom this book .
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
We don &apos;t want your money .
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
They &apos;re right behind me .
We &apos;re here for Tom .
I &apos;m not going to do that .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing .
What do you have to say ?
She seems to be happy .
I had nothing to say .
We &apos;re meeting in an hour in front of the hotel .
Tom knows a girl who can speak French quite well .
Tom goes to school , doesn &apos;t he ?
He read this book yesterday .
I &apos;m surprised you &apos;re still here .
I wouldn &apos;t mind a beer right now .
Tom is not able to swim .
I didn &apos;t look at Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much .
What else do you know about that ?
We haven &apos;t seen each other for such a long time .
Don &apos;t be late .
Mary is my wife .
There &apos;s a table .
What did they say to you ?
Tom and Mary look very happy together .
This room is cold .
Do you want to go with Tom ?
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
Do you know how to get home ?
What &apos;s Tom good at doing ?
Can you come ?
I &apos;d like to stand .
I often see Tom leave early .
How did this happen ?
They have lost a lot .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s parents .
What do you think of my plan ?
What is the truth ?
We never talk .
Why were you in Boston ?
You know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well , don &apos;t you ?
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
I don &apos;t remember anything about it .
I don &apos;t know what to believe .
Why did Tom do it ?
How long have you been studying English ?
I have a lot of questions .
Where can we meet ?
You didn &apos;t tell me Tom speaks French .
What do they do here ?
May I go home ?
He doesn &apos;t have as many books as she does .
It &apos;s up to us .
It is time to go to school .
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
You know Tom has a thing for you .
Did you meet her ?
I knew I should &apos;ve married you .
I know what he did .
Give it to me , Tom .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Tom wants to go with you .
Why are you busy today ?
You have to show me what to do .
Tom and Mary each have a bicycle .
Don &apos;t tell Tom .
Did you find a doctor ?
I have a lot to do .
You must go to school .
There &apos;s a new boy in school .
Tom is your brother .
Are you here to see Tom ?
Tom should talk to me .
We &apos;ll all go there together .
I &apos;d like to go with you .
Can I do anything for you ?
I &apos;d like to go with you , but I &apos;m broke .
I know Tom is happy .
I like this book .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t have time .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell us anything .
Do you want to go home ?
Tom has more money than Mary .
We like children .
Tom left after me .
What did Tom want us to do ?
I can &apos;t hear a word .
Tom knows what to do , doesn &apos;t he ?
He did what he had been told .
Tom will be here soon .
I no longer want that .
It &apos;s been five years since I last saw you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
I &apos;m a friend .
Tom said he knew you .
I can &apos;t stay for dinner .
Tom said that &apos;s no problem .
I &apos;ve asked Tom not to do that .
I was right behind Tom .
There &apos;s one other thing we need to buy .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to learn French .
We can still be friends .
I &apos;ll stay at home tomorrow .
I know Tom wants us to help him .
It was yesterday that I saw him .
They were my friends .
I don &apos;t know when Tom left .
What do you want us to do ?
I may have told you such a thing , but I don &apos;t remember it at all .
I want to go to school .
Tom has a lot of books .
What &apos;ll you give Tom ?
Maybe what Tom said was true .
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time .
Why are we still talking about this ?
Let &apos;s help Tom .
Who knows what you saw ?
Tom wanted to go with Mary .
What &apos;s Tom doing with that ?
Tom walked alone .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
I know where Tom works .
He sat looking out of the window .
What am I going to do with this ?
He did not speak at all .
I want us to be a family .
What else did you see ?
I &apos;m sure that it &apos;ll be fun .
I have to sleep .
Tom , will you stop that ?
They don &apos;t want us .
Tom will help us .
Do you want me to go with Tom ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
Tom seems young .
I hope to see you soon .
Is that what people do ?
Tom gave me that .
I think Tom will like that .
I &apos;m too busy to help him .
We have to do something , Tom .
Did you hear what Tom said about Mary ?
I &apos;ve never been there myself .
I don &apos;t want to hear it .
What &apos;s that your wearing ?
You are a woman .
Please let me know what you want .
Why does Tom do it ?
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him .
There was nothing for us to drink .
What else did you buy ?
We don &apos;t have to be here .
I can &apos;t live any longer without him .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry .
Tom is important .
Tom is busy this afternoon .
Tom is going to enjoy this .
Are you from here ?
I think I know what you need .
I &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
Have you seen this man ?
I like my job very much .
I think it &apos;s time for us to leave .
I need to talk to Tom .
I must go right away .
Why are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
It is really quite a good story .
Don &apos;t tell her about it .
Tom didn &apos;t tell the truth .
That bicycle is mine .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished all his homework yet .
My father is rich .
My parents are both from Boston .
Tom always speaks French .
He &apos;s all right .
Where does Tom do that ?
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary is .
What if Tom is right ?
Tom won &apos;t be back .
What does Tom do every day ?
That &apos;s what she said .
I saw Tom coming .
Tom looked very busy .
You can still help Tom , can &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t want to drink that .
It &apos;s best not to ask .
She has never seen him .
What &apos;s it we &apos;re waiting for ?
Tom is going to school in Australia .
Have you finished it ?
Tom wanted to buy a new car .
I told Tom that I was busy .
He isn &apos;t like his brother .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
This might be over soon .
You have one hour to get this done .
Tom never goes to school by bus .
How far away are we ?
What did Tom tell you about me ?
He bought a book and gave it to his father .
Tom came too late .
I think this book is easy .
Do you want to know or not ?
How many people are there ?
This is too difficult for me .
What are you doing in my office ?
Will you be at home tonight ?
How much do you like Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
What has he done ?
Would you like to play a game ?
Will we be there soon ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
How hard would it be to do that ?
How are you now ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about Australia .
I &apos;d like to take this with me .
Don &apos;t be so sure .
Tom was almost as surprised as Mary .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
I need an answer now .
Tom lives with us .
I know what I want .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be here long .
Why were you there ?
I wish you had told me about the accident .
How did you learn to speak French so well ?
Let Tom buy what he wants .
What &apos;re you doing today ?
He is going to be a father soon .
Tom didn &apos;t think so .
He won &apos;t live much longer .
Can I stay ?
He lives in a large house .
I &apos;ll meet her tomorrow .
How much money do you have ?
You really did a good job .
Tom is playing with Mary &apos;s cat .
I hope that you will like it .
He was in the hospital for a week .
I want to be rich .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like me ?
Tom has to do that tomorrow .
I don &apos;t think that he will come .
Who wants tea ?
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
I am not too tired .
When did you get back home ?
I &apos;m very happy about that .
I &apos;m not coming .
They don &apos;t have to know .
I saw Tom this morning .
What &apos;s Tom eating ?
When did you learn how to swim ?
We &apos;ll take it .
I &apos;m thinking of the plan .
What are we going to do with it ?
I know this must be very difficult for you .
Why didn &apos;t I think of it myself ?
He has a new woman in his life .
I saw the movie .
I bought the book for ten dollars .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that right away .
I gave Tom my word that I wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary about that .
If I were rich , I &apos;d give you money .
I had fun doing that .
That &apos;s news to me .
Don &apos;t let Tom help Mary .
We need to know .
That &apos;s how it is done .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Who &apos;s with Tom ?
Tom is a good boy .
You &apos;ll be here with me .
Tom knows this .
You had better tell me now .
You should &apos;ve done it .
I thought that you might &apos;ve left town .
She is like a mother to me .
Tom can &apos;t speak French .
Tom wanted to be a teacher .
Why would I do that ?
They will understand .
I want a job .
You need not have come so early .
Tom wasn &apos;t very happy .
Tom asked Mary if she knew John .
Tom knows what to do .
Tom looked again .
I &apos;m happy about this .
You should wait until Monday to do that .
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;m sorry I cannot go with you .
She is old .
You didn &apos;t have to do this .
Tom knows I &apos;m at home .
I don &apos;t want to play tennis this afternoon .
I arrived this afternoon .
You &apos;re up early .
I was asked to do this .
Tom was here with Mary .
You &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
That &apos;s how you do it .
I &apos;d like to know why .
This is for Tom .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll get it .
Tom couldn &apos;t have helped Mary .
Tom is looking good today .
Why did Tom ask Mary to do that ?
I &apos;m not done with you yet .
Her plan seems to be better than mine .
Is there anything I should know ?
I &apos;ll go ask Tom .
You don &apos;t have to go .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have no more time .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
They want to see you .
I really wish I could play tennis with you tomorrow .
I cannot do without this book .
Tom went alone .
She speaks quickly .
Tom and Mary were the last two to leave .
I looked in the window .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
We &apos;re all right .
I didn &apos;t mean anything by that .
We don &apos;t like it .
He never saw his father again .
This book is too difficult for you to read .
That is not true .
He needs it .
I came to say I &apos;m sorry .
Can you really not swim ?
I said that quite a long time ago .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
Tom wants to come .
That &apos;s good advice .
What do you want to do with this ?
I know that Mary loves me .
I know that she is beautiful .
What &apos;ll you do with Tom ?
They &apos;re yours .
This book is very good .
What is this ?
The train left before they got to the station .
What did you expect me to say ?
How are Tom and Mary ?
That will do .
We didn &apos;t have school today .
What &apos;s up ?
Tom and Mary are both ready .
Tom can come .
They want to know what &apos;s going on .
We don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He never saw his sister again .
Can you hear it ?
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
They are going to meet at the hotel tomorrow .
How much can we take ?
Tom will like this place .
He wants to work in a hospital .
Why don &apos;t you just let Tom help ?
I think we can do that .
No one will believe Tom .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
I just want to get it over with .
That is quite another matter .
Tom said that he was too busy to help Mary do that .
That doesn &apos;t mean that I &apos;ll stop doing it .
Tom and Mary plan to get married soon .
Tom and Mary are young .
Tom looked at his dog .
I can read them all .
Don &apos;t you have anything to do ?
How many times did you talk to Tom last week ?
You can tell the truth .
Tom will never understand why we want him to do this .
Are you busy now ?
It was a good idea .
It doesn &apos;t have a name .
I changed clothes .
Tom and Mary are together .
Tom is doing well .
I want to be here for you .
That &apos;s what we want to know .
I saw Tom again last night .
Is what you said about Tom really true ?
I don &apos;t want to stay here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is like .
It seemed like a good idea .
I had to buy some food .
I saw him in the park .
We need your help .
Tom and Mary know about it .
We need more time .
You should have helped him with his work .
We &apos;re not good enough .
That &apos;s not possible anymore .
I &apos;m not doing it again .
I may never see you again .
I &apos;ll read it .
I really am very busy .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
Where do you have to do that ?
They don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
Tom knew exactly what he was doing .
I don &apos;t remember that at all .
Why don &apos;t you all come with me ?
Tom will do it .
Tom went back to the table .
He was angry with his son .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be as busy as Mary is .
I don &apos;t like this place .
That &apos;s not for you .
There was more than enough food .
It really happened , didn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
Where is her family ?
Tom got up at six almost every day .
We &apos;ll meet again .
Tom has to give Mary something .
I do not know whether it is good or not .
Did you see the accident ?
I think that we should forget about this .
I &apos;m not going home .
I saw Tom do that .
He must find work .
This one &apos;s on me .
What do you want me to do about Tom ?
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
I &apos;m sure Tom is just fine .
I think we can do it .
That &apos;s a table .
No one lives here .
Have you heard from him ?
I want to know why .
How did you come by all this money ?
Are you sure they can do this ?
I &apos;ve heard of you .
Can I help you ?
That wasn &apos;t what I wanted to hear .
I thought you &apos;d like Tom .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
What else does Tom have ?
I must visit my friend in the hospital .
They found us .
Tom can drive a car , too .
Did you see that ?
I hope he &apos;ll be able to come ! I &apos;d like to see him .
We &apos;re so busy .
What does that do ?
Please read that book .
It &apos;s time to put the children to bed .
Do you know what it says ?
Is Tom with you ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t want that .
Who else was there ?
We don &apos;t study French .
He doesn &apos;t always come late .
Give it to me , please .
We like it .
I can &apos;t work for you .
She wasn &apos;t able to meet him .
You should get out once in a while .
Get a doctor in here .
I want one !
I don &apos;t really know .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom again .
Can you give me some money ?
He loves coffee .
I think you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom saw Mary in her car .
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom ?
Tom asked Mary why she was late .
Let &apos;s see what Tom can do for us .
It &apos;s here .
I wasn &apos;t talking about you .
Tom stopped by .
He had more than enough money .
You can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I don &apos;t want this anymore .
Tom may be studying French .
The day is getting longer and longer .
I find it hard to believe .
Let me go just once .
You &apos;re talking too fast .
I have many books that I haven &apos;t read .
I didn &apos;t see it .
We know something about it .
She might come .
I want that book .
I would like to go to Japan .
That won &apos;t work !
I think I &apos;ll buy a new car .
Tom seems to agree with us .
I felt cold .
She is no longer what she used to be .
Tom wants to buy a new car .
Do you know who wrote this book ?
Tom will take it .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
What did he do to you ?
I &apos;m really old .
It looks like Tom is having fun .
I &apos;m sorry Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom wanted to know why Mary wasn &apos;t here .
Tom &apos;ll understand .
Tom is far from happy .
When will we go home ?
I need you to do it yourself .
What does Tom want us to do ?
It &apos;s all I want .
Let &apos;s play house .
I &apos;m afraid for his life .
I think Tom wants to stay .
Tom isn &apos;t quite finished yet .
I expect to come .
How did you get this idea ?
I &apos;m sorry , I forgot to do my homework .
You should listen to him .
Tom must do it now .
Will you let me try once more ?
You didn &apos;t need to do that .
Tom won &apos;t be here tonight .
I &apos;ll go to Boston with Tom .
What &apos;s wrong with yours ?
I &apos;m going home with Tom .
That is going too far .
Why does Tom always look so tired ?
He &apos;s too old .
The teacher can &apos;t have said such a thing .
I want to make Tom happy .
I wish that I could do more .
Tom isn &apos;t rich .
I just saw Tom and Mary together .
How do you want to do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what that is .
It &apos;s not cold .
I thought Tom was a doctor .
Tom wanted a new car .
It &apos;s not your money that I want .
I &apos;m tired of being sick .
How can Tom not understand that ?
I can &apos;t find a good job .
We should go this way .
I know exactly where I am .
Tom has my car .
Why are people here ?
I &apos;ve got to get back to work .
Tom may not come .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
Do you want to tell me what happened ?
I &apos;m not your son .
I expect that he will help us .
I hope we &apos;re not too late .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
I am surprised to see you here in this hotel .
He was out of town last week .
They don &apos;t want you . They want Tom .
I like them both .
I wasn &apos;t even there .
It &apos;s about time you went to bed .
Tom is my teacher .
I &apos;m very , very happy .
Can you please leave me alone ?
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
Do you know why Tom came here today ?
He is still in bed .
Tom is the man of the house .
Let &apos;s always be friends .
We know about Tom .
I don &apos;t want to eat this .
I know Tom does that every morning .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive .
Tom left his wife .
This must be the place .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that , could he ?
Come quickly .
Tom asked us not to come .
I can &apos;t be without you .
Is this it ?
What are you going to do tonight ?
Don &apos;t give me a thing .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home .
What &apos;re we doing here , Tom ?
I &apos;m not going to be very happy .
That &apos;s what I saw .
They &apos;ll find me .
We don &apos;t get out much .
I &apos;m going to need help .
I &apos;ll come back soon .
He is afraid of the dog .
I &apos;ll tell you how to do it .
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
Tom looks like a girl .
I know what her name is .
I thought that he was a doctor .
No one knew who he was .
My family isn &apos;t rich .
I do hope so .
Why is Tom there ?
I only hope that is enough .
Tom asked Mary if dinner was ready .
Why didn &apos;t you do that ?
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom .
We haven &apos;t even tried .
It &apos;s all I have .
Thank you for coming , Tom .
These books are my books .
Tom is a very good friend of mine .
We don &apos;t have long .
We came to see you .
I am ready .
I said I saw Tom .
There goes our bus .
Tom always looked busy .
I could help you with that .
I think Tom wants our help .
You shouldn &apos;t have done it .
It &apos;s a bad time .
You look sick .
Tom is his brother .
This is his car .
These are my books .
I don &apos;t want to know about it .
It &apos;s just money .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
Do you know where the money is ?
I hope your Tom will soon be better .
Who &apos;s going ?
Tom may go to Boston next week .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom .
I saw Tom in the park .
I can &apos;t go to school today . I &apos;m sick .
You &apos;ve done it again .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak .
Tom didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Tom does love Mary .
I &apos;ve nothing to give .
What are you going to do for Tom ?
Tom ate .
I &apos;ve got nothing to do .
I just need to know what happened .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
Have you eaten your dinner already ?
I need some time with Tom .
I don &apos;t do it anymore .
Tom is there .
I just don &apos;t understand you anymore .
Is Tom still around ?
He was born rich .
I wonder what it would be like to be rich .
Mary , I love you .
Tom and his friends are outside .
Tom didn &apos;t say a word to me .
We need some money .
Everyone makes mistakes .
It was not easy for us to find his house .
Are you here alone ?
He does not like tennis .
Tom wants this .
How &apos;s your French coming ?
We &apos;re very sorry about that .
He asked me what was the matter with me .
Tom wants to become a doctor .
He asked for my advice .
She hardly ever works .
I should &apos;ve known it was you .
It made Tom happy .
She always speaks English .
How much is that all together ?
Tom looks cold .
Tom told Mary that he was busy .
What does Tom want Mary to do ?
I &apos;m sorry , but my mother is out at the moment .
Tom is kind to Mary .
Tom knows what you did .
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom lives .
If Tom can do it , I &apos;m sure I can do it , too .
Why did you write this book ?
I know his brother well .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
Why did this happen ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why he &apos;s here .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I know what you &apos;re going to say .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Is Tom still on the job ?
Nobody came .
Tom didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know a thing about it .
Can you walk ?
You &apos;d better tell him the truth .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
Is this too big ?
I &apos;m not ready to be a mother .
I saw you .
You &apos;ve come too early .
I need to do something .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
I go to school every day .
I went to Boston by train .
Why don &apos;t you go to Tom &apos;s ?
She &apos;s not here .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be home .
No one is going with me .
She has been sick for a week .
They don &apos;t want you .
We needed to do that .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t very happy here .
Why do you have to do it ?
They know where Tom is .
Tom is going to like it here .
Is that your sister ?
Tom and Mary won &apos;t play tennis together this week .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t ready yet .
I &apos;m surprised to see you here .
Are you all by yourself ?
Tom gets up at six .
Tom thinks he knows where Mary lives .
Tom says he &apos;s on his way back home .
You can go home if you like .
My children don &apos;t listen to me .
Tom likes to eat out .
You must tell Tom the truth .
Tom was the one who wrote this story .
You already know the truth .
He &apos;s old enough to be your father .
I thought that he was angry .
He is her friend .
I know you &apos;re not like Tom .
This is me .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about Tom .
I expect I &apos;ll have to do that for Tom .
I love that movie .
You two seem to get along well .
Please ask someone else .
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
I need Tom .
Tom had only three dollars on him .
How much food do you need ?
You have to let me help you .
Tom and I have a daughter .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk right now .
I told you I don &apos;t know how to do that .
This might not be enough .
Everyone was happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary &apos;s living there alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to be here .
Tom needs to stop doing that .
I want to be happy .
My family is living in Boston .
She has already left the office .
I have no books to read .
Tom came to my office today .
The day turned out to be fine .
Do you want money ?
I don &apos;t think I understand .
I love her and she loves me .
Tom kept me waiting .
Where do you want this ?
Is that all you want to know ?
Tom didn &apos;t want anything to do with Mary .
Why is life so difficult ?
I will get in touch with you next week .
I still have a few minutes .
I will go if you go .
What will you make ?
Everyone &apos;s reading .
His mother sat up all night waiting for her son .
Is it difficult to learn French ?
I have never seen such a thing .
Tom was here with Mary yesterday afternoon .
I can &apos;t talk right now . I need to go .
You may come if you like .
I asked Tom to come .
How long has she been sick ?
Tom and I don &apos;t do that .
I thought you said you were bad at French .
Do you know how ?
What did this Tom say ?
We can &apos;t tell Tom .
We went to Australia together three years ago .
I believe you can help us .
She just left .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
Let &apos;s go by bus .
I am very sorry for what I said .
Tom and Mary were both busy .
What &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
Don &apos;t be like Tom .
This bicycle is Tom &apos;s .
It &apos;s time you went to bed .
Tom wasn &apos;t always this way .
I don &apos;t know that much about you .
I &apos;ve always done it that way .
No one can help you .
I was very happy .
Tom saw that Mary was busy .
Tom knew something .
Let Tom finish .
Did you see your friends last week ?
He didn &apos;t see a thing .
What else did Tom say ?
His story may not be true .
It &apos;s my job .
It is a long story .
I wish I could do something .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my dog .
What does she have ?
Tom made it for me .
Where is my car ?
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston ?
This book is Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;d already thought of that .
Tom did well in school .
You worry too much .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s you .
Do you have anything else to say ?
Tom wrote to Mary this week .
There &apos;s nothing I want to say to you .
We don &apos;t have to read that .
Tom said he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
We have enough food .
What should I say ?
Please come here soon if you don &apos;t mind .
I don &apos;t love her .
Are you through with the book ?
What are we going to do with Tom ?
Tom is getting married soon .
You &apos;re not alone , Tom .
What is two times two ?
That book is a new book .
I have to know .
Tom wanted it .
Don &apos;t be late for school again .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom seems busy .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
It must be pretty cold .
Who could forget it ?
Do you know who they are ?
I won &apos;t be able to help you .
Where &apos;s your dog ?
Tom lost his hat .
My mother is out .
I know the way .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
Tom isn &apos;t going to see me .
It is cold today .
You should probably tell Tom how to do that .
He did not come .
I only think of you .
He &apos;s too old for her .
I already knew this .
I &apos;m your brother .
I &apos;m not very busy .
What does he plan to do ?
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
I want to work in a hospital .
I didn &apos;t want anything to do with Tom .
They won &apos;t have arrived yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to work .
I said I &apos;m sorry .
I might not like it .
Did you study French in high school ?
Can he see us ?
Tom is rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
I want to know who &apos;s coming with us .
Tom did that a lot .
I understand it .
I did no such thing .
I want these .
She came to like the house .
Tom can &apos;t talk .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here today .
I don &apos;t have to ask anyone .
It is not my day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to eat anything else .
Tom wants to go , too .
You don &apos;t have to do what Tom says .
I will tell him about it when he comes next time .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
My wife &apos;s trying to sleep .
That &apos;s just not enough .
I thought we were out of coffee .
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t there .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting here like this .
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow .
Tom works all night .
What do you know about Australia ?
My brother speaks very quickly .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
He made mistake after mistake .
We all make mistakes .
Tom arrived very late .
Tom was at home .
Do you play tennis ?
That happened here .
I didn &apos;t know that he was there .
Tom has been busy all morning .
Do you have any children ?
I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
We shouldn &apos;t have let Tom go .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
That &apos;s never happened to us before .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come with us .
I want to show you something in my office .
I don &apos;t want you to go .
Tom isn &apos;t well today .
She &apos;s not my girlfriend .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
Is Tom a teacher ?
Tom is making us do this .
Why can &apos;t we do it again ?
I don &apos;t have anything to eat .
I want to know .
Would you like to drink anything ?
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
I think I &apos;d like to be your friend .
They aren &apos;t my books .
I have no idea who she is .
We can talk about it .
Do you want to come with us ?
I don &apos;t remember who gave me this .
Tom and Mary are here , too .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t need money .
Tom is in the house .
She came to see us yesterday .
English is not hard to learn .
How long were you in Boston ?
I &apos;m very happy to see you .
Tom isn &apos;t there .
Tom is very sick .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t stay long .
I &apos;ve already read this book .
I like both .
You can visit me tomorrow .
I &apos;ve been saying that all along .
I don &apos;t want to get married .
They need to work tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it .
I can &apos;t leave Tom there .
I didn &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
We &apos;re a big family .
You can &apos;t do two things at once .
Tom came by bus .
Is this book yours ?
He has made me what I am today .
She has done her homework .
You &apos;ll have to go .
Who saw me ?
Tom never told me he wanted to go to Boston with us .
We &apos;re going to Boston to see Tom .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom for quite some time .
Tom isn &apos;t a very good man .
Tom isn &apos;t a doctor .
Tom may be doing that .
I have a new car .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
They believe it .
His car is two years old .
That &apos;s a problem .
Tom won &apos;t leave if you don &apos;t want him to .
Why aren &apos;t they coming ?
I asked Tom to wait for a few more minutes .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what he needs to do .
I &apos;d say go for it .
Tom is going to like being in Boston .
This dog is big .
My mother gets up early every morning .
I hope Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
What is the matter with you ?
How did you come by that much money ?
They aren &apos;t alone .
This question is too difficult for me to answer .
He said , &quot; I want to be a doctor . &quot;
Tom had to stay in bed .
I have almost no money with me .
I think we have enough .
They will come .
When &apos;s the big day ?
Tom won &apos;t wait .
I know that he was busy .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I was in the house .
I don &apos;t agree with you .
I &apos;m not going to ask again .
I &apos;m a good teacher .
There &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem like himself .
I can &apos;t live without you .
Can &apos;t someone else do this ?
I wrote more today than yesterday .
I &apos;ve been doing this for thirty years .
What are you two doing ?
What else did you say ?
Tom is sick in bed .
Everyone is doing it .
Tom will meet you there .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to go ?
I was too happy to sleep .
We still need your help .
Why does Tom want to do that ?
Who are they ?
I &apos;m not a woman .
How often do you see him ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary went to Boston .
Is this your book ?
It &apos;s always been that way .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
Tom knew it was wrong .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows French .
I need time .
I have something else to do .
You go to school , don &apos;t you ?
I know a lot about it .
Are you through with this book ?
We &apos;ve only got three days .
I saw Tom on Monday .
I believe that Tom loves me .
Can &apos;t you speak English ?
She bought a new car .
I still love him .
I have to ask you about Tom .
Tom won &apos;t let me drive anymore .
I can &apos;t hear Tom .
We &apos;re working on that .
I didn &apos;t know you had a cat .
That &apos;s not very good .
I want to stay in Boston for a few more days .
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
Where &apos;s Tom from ?
I &apos;m going to go .
What have you ever done for us ?
This boy is his brother .
I never make my bed .
Tom &apos;s well .
You &apos;re in the way .
Can you give my brother a job ?
Tom said no one else was there .
Tom is always on the go .
I got Tom to help .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Why did that matter ?
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that .
Tom heard that Mary was sick .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been here today .
Have you ever seen this movie before ?
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
Have you read the book yet ?
This is our car .
Tom looked well .
I thought you might ask that .
Do you want me to do that ?
That can &apos;t be Mary . She &apos;s in the hospital now .
I knew you &apos;d like that .
They aren &apos;t happy to see Tom .
I can &apos;t trust what she says .
I heard that Tom wasn &apos;t a good teacher .
I &apos;ll talk to Tom later about this .
That &apos;s my book .
I want to make her happy .
He likes to talk about himself .
What do you think about this plan ?
Tom said Mary isn &apos;t happy .
I don &apos;t think I can get through all this work by five .
I &apos;ve still got work to do .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
I &apos;m not going out .
Tom left about thirty minutes ago .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy a new bicycle .
I didn &apos;t like it .
Tom comes here every other day .
Tom is no longer living in Boston .
Tom just got home from work .
I want to go to school in Australia .
Why doesn &apos;t he come back ?
I like your car .
Give me my money .
It only happened once .
Tom has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
Tom thought Mary knew John .
He doesn &apos;t know much about Japan .
If I were you , I &apos;d talk to Tom .
Tom got up early this morning .
I can &apos;t tell you that yet .
I wish I could sing as well as you do .
I hope he hasn &apos;t had an accident .
I &apos;ve got to show you something .
He had to stay in hospital for a whole week .
We have a lot of things we need to do .
Tom and Mary are like family .
I don &apos;t know who made the cake .
I hope that this isn &apos;t a mistake .
Tom &apos;s not going to be happy .
You had better not see her today .
I was born in Boston .
I &apos;m getting better .
I have a question for you .
Is this what you want ?
What is it , Tom ?
Tom was there with one of his friends .
Is his father a doctor ?
Why don &apos;t you go home now ?
Who said that it would be easy ?
Tom could &apos;ve said something , but he didn &apos;t .
I know what you did .
They did it again .
I can &apos;t drive a bus .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
Tom wanted you to see it right away .
Tom thought Mary was in the room .
You have my word .
That &apos;s one way of doing it .
I think I &apos;d better stay here .
I know him very well .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
We &apos;re finished here .
I didn &apos;t really know what to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Tom got out of bed and put his clothes on .
I can &apos;t see everything .
I said I &apos;d wait for Tom .
Tom said it was out of the question .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
I don &apos;t know why he was late .
Maybe we should talk .
Tom may do what he wants .
I am sure of his coming to the party .
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us .
You should &apos;ve let me sing .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe anything Mary says .
It &apos;s difficult to please Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary could swim .
Tom is in Mary &apos;s office .
I think I &apos;m just tired .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
I know what happened .
I think we need more time .
We can do a lot more .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
Do you want to do it ?
I &apos;d like you to have it .
What is it that you want , Tom ?
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
Would you mind not doing that ?
I don &apos;t think Tom likes me .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t like you .
Let them all come .
Tom takes a bus to work .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
Where did you buy these shoes ?
Tom knew nothing .
You look like Tom .
You can &apos;t swim here .
He &apos;s never been better .
We &apos;re sorry .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
I saw that one .
I &apos;ve got almost everything I need .
Tom is going to like it .
Is that your room ?
I was in the hospital for a week .
He has enough money to buy it .
I &apos;ll show you around town .
How many times do you think you &apos;ve eaten here ?
I wish I could go to Japan .
You need me more than I need you .
We are all happy to help .
We &apos;re not going there .
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
That &apos;s about it .
I know why that is .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong .
She isn &apos;t good enough for him .
What you need is a friend .
They may not be home .
What I want to know is why .
I &apos;d like you to help me do that .
I know Tom isn &apos;t very happy here .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Mary has big eyes .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I think they saw me .
Please don &apos;t go away .
I have to get back to Boston .
That &apos;s a good idea !
I can &apos;t tell you any more about it .
Do you have any good books for children to read ?
I knew Tom had something to do with it .
Tom gets up at six every morning .
What don &apos;t you like about your job ?
I want to visit you .
You are wanted on the phone .
Tom heard something and went to find out what it was .
He doesn &apos;t live there anymore .
I want to live in a town .
Mary is mine .
I made Tom do that .
A cat has been on the table .
My problem is I &apos;m too busy .
I love living in Boston .
I never get to see you anymore .
I have an idea .
What do you have to do ?
It all started in Boston .
Tom always thinks he &apos;s right .
I think Tom should do that .
I want to eat .
Tom and Mary have just left .
We tried that yesterday .
Tom just ate .
I wish I could tell you the reason , but I can &apos;t .
Tom isn &apos;t a good teacher .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
You might not want to go there by yourself .
You shouldn &apos;t have bought that .
Tom is still there .
Why do people do this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to think .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at school ?
How did Tom find you ?
Tom knows he &apos;s right .
How long do we have to wait ?
She &apos;s not a doctor .
It &apos;s cold here .
What did you tell Tom ?
I was tired , but I couldn &apos;t sleep .
It &apos;s morning .
What time does the first train leave ?
Don &apos;t worry about my dog .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
Have you seen him before ?
Tom likes the idea .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t sick .
I do that for Tom .
I wanted to give Tom some money .
You haven &apos;t seen Tom , have you ?
I know how busy you are .
I don &apos;t know what else I can say .
Tom will come soon .
What &apos;s not to like ?
I hope you &apos;ll soon get well .
Tom didn &apos;t speak .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
What I think doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;m coming to your party .
I &apos;m sure Tom &apos;s fine .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that with you .
I want to talk to the police .
We want to be here for Tom .
I want a new car .
You &apos;ll like this .
How long has Tom been gone ?
Are you with Tom ?
They were really cold .
I forgot Tom knew how to read French .
Tom is Mary &apos;s son .
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sister .
They are my friends .
I should go to bed .
Tom is still outside .
I &apos;ll be back in just a few minutes .
Where does Tom have to do that ?
What is this girl &apos;s name ?
It &apos;s time we went home .
I &apos;m sorry I have to go .
No one could tell where she was .
Why can &apos;t Tom come ?
I &apos;m doing this for you .
Nobody came to help me .
I have never met a person like him .
I &apos;d like some shoes .
You should get married again .
I almost feel sorry for you .
Tom took it .
Tom says he still has no idea where Mary is .
They &apos;re our friends .
They &apos;re coming home .
Did Tom say anything before he died ?
Tom is the one who told me what to do .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
What &apos;s Tom going to say about that ?
Tom wanted to stay at home .
We have nothing .
I can &apos;t remember when I first met Tom .
Tom lives with his parents .
Tom would like to know what he did wrong .
Are you alone now ?
That is all right .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom lives .
You don &apos;t know my brother .
Tom speaks French a little .
Can we have a moment alone ?
It was all Tom &apos;s idea .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do today .
Tom knows he shouldn &apos;t do that .
There are many people who don &apos;t speak French .
We know what you want .
You &apos;re big .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom about his brother John .
I think we &apos;d better go .
Tom asked Mary some questions .
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t talk with you .
Is that coffee ?
What have I done wrong ?
She knew what needed to be done .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary was the one who did that .
I know what I will do .
I haven &apos;t been in Australia very long .
That &apos;s not my car .
I just have one question .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us everything .
I asked Tom what was wrong .
He was alone there .
I had a good time .
Who did you get this from ?
There &apos;s not enough coffee .
I &apos;m busy , so I can &apos;t go .
You &apos;re not too old to do that .
I think I know what to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to work here anymore .
Why is that here ?
That &apos;s enough for today .
Come on , Tom .
Don &apos;t you know what it is ?
I know you want to see Tom .
He will become a good doctor .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
He &apos;s not a boy anymore .
I &apos;m not going to stay here with you .
The world is not what it used to be .
I &apos;m going out in an hour .
That looks like Tom .
The police were here .
I don &apos;t know what has become of the boy .
You never come over anymore .
My mother and father aren &apos;t home right now .
Tom would leave .
It &apos;s been a long night .
Come and see me tomorrow .
It &apos;s been a long week .
He made for home .
Can &apos;t you buy a car ?
I just wanted to listen to some music .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do if he were me .
I &apos;m at the hospital now .
You &apos;re a woman now .
I wish I could swim .
He did it just for fun .
Tom comes from a big family .
I have money enough to buy it .
I &apos;m happy to be able to help you .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be rich .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
Tom can drive now .
I have to stay in bed all day .
This is something Tom made for you .
I don &apos;t quite know how it happened .
It couldn &apos;t be Tom .
How do they look ?
We &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
What &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
We &apos;re studying French .
I don &apos;t know anything about her family .
She was busy doing her homework .
Is it that hard ?
Tom doesn &apos;t care about money .
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
That &apos;s what I heard .
That &apos;s very good .
Tom had a good idea .
I have a problem and I need your advice .
You can &apos;t trust what she says .
I must study .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t have children .
I hope it &apos;s not Tom .
Can we talk about this later ?
You &apos;re so right .
Tom really made it happen .
I know your son .
No one had an answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go .
I think I &apos;ll like being here .
Tom will come tomorrow .
It &apos;s important to Tom .
It &apos;s mine , not his .
Tom is going , too .
Tom usually doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
Do you mind if I ask why ?
Everyone is talking about it .
Tom &apos;ll stay .
Did he say that ?
Give me your phone .
You must go at once .
He &apos;s a friend from work .
Tell us something we don &apos;t know .
My father has bought a new car .
Is there another door ?
Tom did this over a year ago .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something .
How long ago did Tom leave ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
I think it would be a mistake to do that .
I made these for you .
What more do you want , Tom ?
I need French for my job .
It &apos;s going to be fine , you know .
Did you see him at the station this morning ?
Tom knew about this .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
We &apos;re getting there .
He is old enough to understand it .
It &apos;ll be good to get home .
That &apos;s not my problem .
I know that he knows .
Where is your school ?
What do you have ?
What have you been doing all week ?
I &apos;m out of here .
Tom is going to be happy here .
Tom said Mary was happy .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his dinner yet .
I don &apos;t want to live here .
There is a man at the door .
The way you &apos;re doing it is wrong .
That &apos;s not all Tom said .
Can someone tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
Where does your family live ?
I believe this is mine .
I kept my word .
I almost wish I could be in your shoes .
I don &apos;t know if he knows it .
Tell Tom I won &apos;t be there .
There &apos;s something I need to ask you .
I &apos;m not doing this for the money .
Just say you &apos;re sorry .
Tom is back in Boston .
What are you going to do there ?
You are very rich .
I asked Tom why .
This is how Tom did it .
He looked like a doctor .
We &apos;re all alone .
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
Did Tom say that ?
Maybe Tom can do it .
I don &apos;t even think about it anymore .
Tom said Mary is very happy .
That &apos;s what you do , isn &apos;t it ?
I wish I could be there with you .
Have you read this book yet ?
Please speak English .
Tom looked a bit sick .
I don &apos;t have enough .
The bus was two minutes early .
I &apos;m going to take this home .
Mary is Tom &apos;s daughter .
What has happened to him ?
I like you .
Tom can speak a little French .
I don &apos;t know that word .
Tom was surprised by what he saw .
How much should they get ?
I fell .
Tom looked very old .
Do you know what time they came ?
Tom wasn &apos;t told why Mary wasn &apos;t there .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary is here .
Come on home .
That wasn &apos;t so bad , was it ?
Tom wanted some food .
That was the trouble .
I did that because I wanted to .
Did something happen ?
What do you want to say to Tom ?
I want you to be happy .
I tried everything .
What &apos;s she doing ?
What do you say ?
Why haven &apos;t you told Tom about what happened last night ?
What do you think of Japan ?
I bought a house .
I &apos;ll write to Tom .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Tom has a lot of money .
I won &apos;t hurt you .
I &apos;m not ready .
I bought a lot of things .
Is Tom ready ?
I have a few questions for you .
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
Give that to him .
I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time .
I can &apos;t get Tom to even talk to me .
I &apos;m a teacher .
Tom found that .
Why did he do such a thing ?
It &apos;s Monday today .
When did you learn to read ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for her help .
Tom knew this .
This is the book Tom gave me .
I never really thought I &apos;d live this long .
I want to know where they are .
I know that Tom is a doctor .
It was just as I thought .
I &apos;d like to go home early today .
I &apos;ll give these to you .
Don &apos;t tell Tom where you live .
My train left at six and arrived at ten .
Did Tom say why Mary isn &apos;t here today ?
I &apos;m not so sure this is such a good idea .
Tom became a doctor .
I couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
I would do that right now if I were you .
I &apos;m not going to do that again .
I should not have said that .
Tom and Mary are playing with John &apos;s cat .
When should we come to Boston ?
I said I &apos;ll do it .
I don &apos;t think Tom will like this place .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom looks good , doesn &apos;t he ?
Did Tom come ?
I don &apos;t want you with me .
What would you do if you were in my place ?
My watch is five minutes fast .
Do you have any more of these ?
Let &apos;s end this fast .
He &apos;s already left .
I will go if I must .
He doesn &apos;t have a family .
Tom gave me this watch .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for years .
Tom seems quite busy , doesn &apos;t he ?
We can &apos;t turn back .
We need to take Tom home .
Did you hear that ?
Tom met with an accident .
Tom must be from Boston .
Tom wanted Mary to be his wife .
Tom &apos;ll talk .
This book is easy enough for me to read .
Is this what Tom wants ?
It &apos;s from your family .
What books did you buy ?
Tom should come .
I think about that from time to time .
I &apos;m coming right away .
I let him go .
He is not young .
I love my country .
That &apos;s a very good question .
You make hardly any mistakes .
Tom was tired .
We &apos;re sorry , too .
They are looking to you for help .
It &apos;s a new book .
That book is old .
Where do you want it ?
I &apos;m a little early .
Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name is John .
What &apos;s this street called ?
We no longer need you .
Tell us how you did it .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten all day .
Tom can &apos;t say for sure how many times Mary has been to Boston .
Tom knows me well .
You don &apos;t look so good .
You &apos;re as beautiful as ever .
Stop saying that .
He thinks he knows best .
It makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ve read this book before .
I had nothing left to eat .
We don &apos;t want that , do we ?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was .
Tom gave his dog something to eat .
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore .
Tom went outside .
How did you do this ?
No one ever saw such a thing .
What were Tom and Mary doing at John &apos;s house ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything about himself .
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
Have you ever seen anything like this before ?
I can &apos;t help you with this .
You &apos;ve already told me this story .
Let me buy you a new one .
Can this be it ?
What does that tell us ?
I know a man who can help .
I can &apos;t help myself .
They know we &apos;re here .
Tom comes from Boston .
We &apos;re not done yet .
Tom may do that .
The room was cold .
Tom is surprised .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see us .
I have to have it .
He saw everything .
Tom wanted Mary to know .
Can someone help me ?
That should be enough .
We &apos;re not going to stop here .
I &apos;ll stay until tomorrow .
Is anybody home ?
My father is in his room .
No one could buy anything .
Don &apos;t come .
I can hardly believe his story .
I &apos;d very much like to know your opinion .
Is it always like this ?
I can &apos;t do this .
Tom was like a father to me .
I want to see that .
What kind of dog is that ?
What does this do ?
I have something to tell you .
Do you know what Tom is doing now ?
I don &apos;t want to do that .
You lost the game .
I feel better every day .
I want you to leave us alone .
I see you &apos;re at it again .
You won &apos;t give that to Tom , will you ?
Tom has money , but I don &apos;t .
He can read and write .
We want to get out of here as soon as we can .
I just wanted to see if I could do that .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
Many parents think it &apos;s important for their children to learn how to speak French .
Tom and Mary were happy .
It &apos;s the first time that anybody said something like that to me .
Is this true ?
Is this the one you saw ?
I &apos;m just about done .
Tom wants to see you and me .
Did Tom give you that ?
How rich is Tom ?
I think Tom is in Boston .
What &apos;s his name ?
I &apos;ve bought a car .
We are at home .
You can &apos;t help me .
Please give me the letter .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
I don &apos;t want to leave Boston .
Tom is old enough to know better .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
What do we have here ?
Where are you taking Tom ?
We were friends .
What Tom did was very wrong .
I think Tom is up .
We &apos;ll see you when we get home .
Tom is now up .
I &apos;ve never done this in my life .
Is that car yours ?
No one is saying that .
Are you still busy ?
Tom makes Mary very happy .
No one came .
I met him at the station .
What do you want me to do with this ?
Tom has made it happen .
Where are you going to live ?
If you need my advice , I &apos;d be glad to give it to you .
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
Tom didn &apos;t have to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy , does he ?
Tom looked ready .
I only want to help Tom .
He had already gone .
I have to see you .
Tom says things are going well .
Tom doesn &apos;t want one .
I can &apos;t understand this word .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
He and I are friends .
Tom goes to school with my son .
This is very easy .
I don &apos;t want to work .
I started to worry .
I want to see Tom .
I already know what happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there alone .
Tom had no reason to be angry .
What &apos;ll it be like ?
I used to go to school with him .
Where do you live ?
It &apos;s no problem .
What do you really want to do ?
That &apos;s quite a long time .
When did I do that ?
Where are you off to ?
You should &apos;ve heard Tom sing . He was really good .
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow .
It &apos;s really Tom .
Tom and Mary are waiting .
Tom made mistakes .
It seems that something has happened .
Tom and Mary both want to study French .
You &apos;re not fast enough .
Tom looked quite tired .
That &apos;s what Tom said , too .
I don &apos;t know if she will come .
I wish I had been there with you .
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Does Tom have a car ?
How are you going to help Tom ?
This used to be my room .
I like you , too .
How did that happen ?
Tom said that he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
I think that we can do that .
We cannot do the work in a day .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat after all .
Tom gave it to us .
Tom asked a few questions .
This is all that I know .
We should go to sleep .
I &apos;m not your mother .
I don &apos;t like your dog .
Tom has been gone for a long time .
We were worried .
Tom came back soon .
This house is very good .
That &apos;s what Tom said this morning .
Tom comes from Australia .
We don &apos;t do this often enough .
They know where we are .
When does he come ?
Don &apos;t spend too much money .
You &apos;re good at this , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom saw you do that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
May I try it ?
I should not have bought such a thing .
I &apos;ll stay at home today .
We all work .
That &apos;s the house where Tom was born .
I like the way you walk .
Are you going to sing here ?
I want to stay here .
Could you please help me ?
Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
I think so , too .
They don &apos;t want you here .
I should &apos;ve stayed home .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten a thing all day .
Tom won &apos;t be here next month .
I can &apos;t even do that .
I just got a letter from my girl .
What was I thinking ?
I &apos;ll have to do that .
I &apos;m not tired .
In Australia , they speak English .
I know Tom is rich .
Tom knew he didn &apos;t have enough money .
You have what it takes .
I want to wait for Tom .
I thought the game was over .
I had better ask them .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that kind of thing anymore .
When did I give you that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look too good .
Do you want to drink ?
Tom says that he &apos;s tired .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
It may be true .
That &apos;s possible .
We ate together .
Tom has asked Mary not to do anything .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom right now .
Tom sat on the bed .
Tom had no food .
I was born here .
They &apos;ll do it .
Tell Tom you can &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it now .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
You &apos;re not going to like that , are you ?
I &apos;d like to help you .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
Do you have a sister ?
Tom asked Mary to stay where she was .
All Tom does is eat .
We &apos;ve got to talk .
I &apos;ll give this to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for anything .
Tom had to leave his dog at home .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
You eat more food than I do .
What I need is more time .
She is , if anything , a little better today than yesterday .
We don &apos;t have to do that .
I was busy yesterday .
I think we need those .
A child needs a mother .
Is she your mother ?
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that &apos;s true .
This does not make me happy .
They are big .
She speaks good English .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to do that .
I can &apos;t leave work until five .
Tom is back again .
Tom knew that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom wasn &apos;t eating .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
We are who we are .
This book is for you .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know .
Tom couldn &apos;t find a job .
She hardly ate anything .
He looks like your brother .
Tom is still in bed .
You should not go alone .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
I hope you and Tom will like it here .
Tom doesn &apos;t do things like that .
I &apos;ve heard everything .
Tom is in need of help .
We are at home today .
You should not have done that . It was wrong .
I just finished .
This work has to be finished by Monday .
I shouldn &apos;t worry .
Tom has work to do .
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
I still have things left to do .
I love you , Tom .
I &apos;m all alone here .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom to do that ?
He &apos;s wearing a hat .
He stopped talking .
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
We &apos;re the problem .
We did nothing wrong .
I &apos;ll visit him tomorrow .
You may still do it if you want to .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is going to do .
Tom said he had a friend in Boston .
What &apos;s the matter with Tom ?
Tom needs to help Mary more than he does .
He came home exactly at ten .
I thought Tom told you about me .
You &apos;re the only person who ever comes to visit me .
We &apos;re not going , are we ?
Tom has what Mary wants .
Tom did it just for fun .
What &apos;re you after ?
I &apos;m very happy with it .
Where did you learn all this ?
What does Tom have to do with this matter ?
Tom isn &apos;t busy today .
I want Tom .
Tom may be at home .
I &apos;m going to need some help .
When can I see you ?
I think of her day and night .
Have him come .
I asked him not to drive so fast .
I &apos;m not sure I want to see this .
Tom asked me to tell you something .
Tom looks happy today .
Tom looked very tired .
This is your problem .
Tom has no friends .
How can I get to the police station ?
Tom is with her .
That &apos;s not what we have to do .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour .
Tom likes to do that here .
Are you still there ?
Please let me in .
I really have to go now .
We went to Boston .
I want to be a good father .
She &apos;s my sister .
I only want to help you .
I was tired and cold .
We don &apos;t have a lot of time .
They &apos;re not always there .
Would you care for more coffee ?
Why are you doing that ?
Tom has one , too .
Tom needs your help to do it .
It &apos;ll be hard to find someone to do that .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
This is my plan .
You cannot do this .
It &apos;s about time .
You can &apos;t stay here .
He stopped reading a book .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom still lives here or not .
I would like to go with you .
Tom was behind me .
I wasn &apos;t busy .
We understand each other .
You &apos;re busy all the time .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that .
Do you know why Tom did it ?
They &apos;re about to go .
I can &apos;t speak English as well as he can .
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
I haven &apos;t told him anything .
I never saw him again .
I did exactly what I said I would do .
I can &apos;t do it that fast .
He doesn &apos;t care about money .
I only have time for coffee .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary , but he couldn &apos;t find her .
Don &apos;t talk !
Who &apos;s coming ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to come .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
Let &apos;s go by car .
My mother can &apos;t come .
I hardly see you anymore .
He will always be with you .
I have a new bicycle .
Tom looks sick .
What do you want with us ?
Nobody talked about the movie .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom will probably be right .
Why don &apos;t you want me to know ?
What can you tell me about this ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem to know what he was doing .
We &apos;re good to go .
The man took the boy by the hand .
I &apos;ll help as much as I can .
Tom needs that money .
Do you want me to be happy ?
I wanted to stay home .
It &apos;s important to read a lot of books .
I never heard you play it better .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with you .
Tom didn &apos;t look at the picture again .
I can &apos;t believe you gave Tom that much money .
I &apos;m here to help .
Tom is doing what he loves .
I know a lot about Australia .
You can wait for me here .
What do you people do ?
I love this park .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend anymore .
You look like a boy .
Why isn &apos;t it good ?
Tom looked old .
He told me a long story .
You &apos;re just making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t buy a car .
I find it hard to understand Tom .
How &apos;s it coming ?
Is French difficult ?
Tom has many things he has to do today .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
He is old enough to drive .
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
We saw Tom do it .
I let Tom in the house .
He ran away with the money .
I think Tom is fine .
How is it possible ?
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
Tell Tom .
We want to go home .
I &apos;m not that happy .
He can &apos;t sing well .
You can &apos;t stop now .
I told you Tom was busy .
That &apos;s what makes me happy .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom .
Which one of you is Tom ?
You don &apos;t know them .
I see your house .
Tom had to stay in the hospital for a week .
Tom does what he says he &apos;ll do .
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
I need this more than you do .
You don &apos;t really know , do you ?
They &apos;re doing great .
Tom is really big .
Nobody can help you .
Tom should &apos;ve done that with us .
It &apos;s time for you to go to bed .
Tom and I see each other every day .
I can &apos;t remember how I got home last night .
Tom has more friends than Mary .
The money is gone .
She left here right away .
Why don &apos;t we take a look ?
That &apos;ll be difficult .
Do you want to go again ?
Why do you want to talk to me ?
We want to see you .
That &apos;s my problem with Tom .
I &apos;d like to see my son .
I need to ask you something .
I &apos;ll be with you right away .
Tom did a really nice job .
It &apos;s that important .
You must believe me .
I &apos;d do it if I could .
As far as I know , he did nothing wrong .
My father gets up early .
I like this . I &apos;ll take it .
Tom says it &apos;s up to Mary .
Is that what Tom said ?
Tom had nothing to do with this .
Let &apos;s do only one thing at a time .
Tom and Mary have a son .
We don &apos;t make mistakes .
They have to go to school .
I want to go to bed early .
I want you to go there with Tom .
We have a problem .
The old man lives alone .
No one else was in the room .
Tom and I have to leave .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
I don &apos;t believe a word Tom says .
Tom could hardly walk .
It takes three hours to get to Boston from here .
I have no friends .
Tom and Mary are friends .
I &apos;d like some more water .
Tell Tom what &apos;s wrong .
Tom is bad .
It was almost too good to be true .
No one loves me .
Who saw you ?
I don &apos;t see what that has to do with this .
My mother died when I was a child .
May I have one of these ?
I &apos;d like to live in Australia .
Tom can do it better than me .
Do you know who I am ?
You have friends here .
I want to talk to him about it .
I let Tom drive my car .
We go to school because we want to learn .
What have you eaten today ?
She &apos;s got more books .
You have a lot of books .
I &apos;m here to see Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be there .
You can &apos;t be everyone &apos;s friend all the time .
Did you go to school today ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can sing well or not .
Tom came to Boston with me .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
This is Tom &apos;s .
Are Tom and Mary with you ?
You should take it easy .
I made Tom go there .
She was my first girlfriend .
They &apos;re afraid of me .
Do you live here ?
Tom didn &apos;t buy it after all .
You are exactly like your father .
I know what to say .
I am a student , but he isn &apos;t .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years .
I want to be in Boston .
What does Tom have to do ?
Tom saw a doctor .
Tom wants to see his son .
How do you know what you should do ?
Tom probably got home last Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
Tom likes Mary , and so do I .
Tom wants you to eat .
I think Tom would tell the truth .
We can make this work .
Is there any room for me ?
I will be busy next week .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is right .
Tom has things to do .
You look fine .
I can &apos;t stand him .
When did it first start to happen ?
I already told you everything I know .
I don &apos;t understand .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t think about that .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom for advice ?
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
I know what this is .
Tom won &apos;t get back home today .
No one saw Tom .
I came as fast as I could .
That &apos;s not a cat . It &apos;s a dog .
I asked Tom to wait for me at the train station .
Tom told Mary she was beautiful .
Tom got up early .
This is Japan .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French at all .
Will Tom be here this afternoon ?
Nobody knows what has become of her .
You &apos;re not going .
When do you have to do that ?
It &apos;s very good .
What book did you buy ?
I really need a job .
Why do you want to see Tom ?
He needs the money .
Let &apos;s get together again !
Tom doesn &apos;t know the whole story .
I don &apos;t know where to wait for her .
How does Tom do this ?
Tom told everyone .
I think that I &apos;m doing something wrong .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a good idea .
She is now well enough to work .
I didn &apos;t want Tom at my party .
Tom likes to drive fast .
I &apos;ve got to leave soon .
Tom can do all that and more .
He couldn &apos;t bring himself to believe her story .
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
I want to be sure Tom is happy .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
I &apos;m as old as Tom is .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s Tom .
I am at home .
It wasn &apos;t enough .
Is the job too much for you ?
How much does Tom spend a month ?
It was so beautiful .
There is nothing to do .
I &apos;ve told Tom everything .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
Tom will always be here for you .
What don &apos;t you have ?
What do we have to do ?
I knew there was nothing you could do about it .
Tell me what I have to do .
I asked him if he would help me .
That house is mine .
Come help me .
It should be possible .
I think Tom and Mary like each other .
I &apos;m sorry , but Tom isn &apos;t home .
Did you see my father ?
I can &apos;t come tomorrow .
Tom couldn &apos;t sleep .
I &apos;ve met you before .
What &apos;s Boston like ?
It &apos;s up to me .
What do they think ?
I know where she lives .
Tom said he needed some more time .
I gave the boy a book .
What was Tom wearing ?
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
He &apos;ll be here soon .
I don &apos;t know why .
Tom is home again .
He looks like his father .
You &apos;re going to be a good father .
Who would do this ?
How long do you need to stay in Boston ?
You can &apos;t just leave .
I &apos;ve already told you that .
Tom never asked questions .
Tom won &apos;t be doing that anymore .
We don &apos;t have to go .
I think you &apos;d like that .
Did you do that ?
We know everything .
That &apos;s what I hope .
I am going to do it .
Can I speak with Tom ?
He won &apos;t be away for long .
Tom was better .
I told Tom not to worry .
We have enough water .
They &apos;re going to try .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that Tom had a daughter ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy .
She could not find her way back .
Why me ?
This is my friend , Tom .
Tom may do that for you .
Tom couldn &apos;t take it any longer .
The cat doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
This is what I need .
Tom will do it when he comes in .
The man at the door wouldn &apos;t tell me his name .
I think this is good .
This one &apos;s mine .
My watch may be one or two minutes fast .
What &apos;s wrong with that ?
It &apos;s been three years since I &apos;ve been to Boston .
Tom knows a man who lives in Boston .
What were you and Tom doing yesterday ?
Let &apos;s get this over with quickly .
I think you &apos;re really going to like it .
Tom was here , too .
Tom can understand you .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
Where do you go to school ?
We want to go .
I want to know more about your country .
Tom was wearing a new hat .
You don &apos;t look all that happy .
I &apos;ve already tried doing that three times .
He has never been late for school .
This work must be finished by tomorrow .
I don &apos;t see why not .
You don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
Tom wants me to do that for him .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
Please , tell me .
Tom isn &apos;t ready .
She loves her children .
No one &apos;s seen Tom .
I need some help with my homework .
I think Tom is getting ready .
A cat was on the table .
It &apos;s your turn .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll like it .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming home .
We were busy .
That &apos;s not what I said .
Why did you buy another car ?
Tom must be about thirty .
I never thought I &apos;d finish it .
He will be back in an hour .
Tom was alone in his room .
What have we done ?
She had a little money .
What happened to him ?
I stayed up all night .
We &apos;re almost there .
There &apos;s got to be something you can do .
We want to help you .
I &apos;m very happy about it .
Tom knows what to say .
I came here to tell you something .
I &apos;m ready for anything .
Tom knows nothing .
Did you speak to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary at all .
When &apos;s that going to happen ?
I was at Tom &apos;s place yesterday .
Tom &apos;s first wife was from Boston .
I have enough money to buy a car .
They &apos;re not coming .
I don &apos;t have any money .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe us .
Tom could hardly hear what Mary was saying .
How do you like living on your own ?
I &apos;ve heard nothing .
I asked him to help me .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know the answer .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money on me .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
I have a lot of work to do today .
We &apos;re done here .
I don &apos;t have any children .
That &apos;s good , too .
How far is it from here to the station ?
Tom wants to see us .
I don &apos;t want to become like those people .
Tom always gets up early .
I don &apos;t have enough money .
I thought that he would come .
I want to sleep .
Are we alone ?
I wanted to do that with you .
I don &apos;t know how to do that .
What more is there ?
What were you doing about this time yesterday ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
I know both of them .
Tom began working .
Tom wants to learn French .
Where did you learn this ?
I wanted to go home .
Tom can &apos;t know the truth .
There was someone else there .
How long have you been busy ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows exactly how that happened .
I didn &apos;t know you had a girlfriend .
Is this my life ?
Tom said it was a problem .
I didn &apos;t do it for you .
I &apos;m here with Tom .
I &apos;ll give you what you want .
Did Tom try ?
Tom went back to bed .
The teacher cannot have said such a thing .
Let Tom do that .
I didn &apos;t eat anything .
Tom wanted to come with us .
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened to me .
Tom saw something behind Mary .
If you really want to know , all you have to do is ask .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you last week .
I think about you all day long .
It was time to leave .
I think Tom looks really good .
I &apos;d like to leave early .
We &apos;re going to get you home .
I wish he were here .
I want to learn .
I &apos;ve always done that that way .
I could not speak to him .
I made Tom happy .
He did not buy it after all .
Did you eat too much ?
What is his age ?
We should wait for help .
Have you eaten ?
I like her very much .
Tom was gone for three days .
He is still angry .
I &apos;d like to ask you about Tom .
This has never happened before .
Tom knows hardly anything about it .
I don &apos;t want to say that to Tom .
What do you want Tom to do ?
Tom must have been at home at that time .
Do you have any beer ?
I think Tom can help .
He &apos;s better than us all .
I &apos;ve heard all this before .
I would do anything for you .
Nobody knows his name .
It &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom did it for fun .
Who says that ?
I don &apos;t know how to swim .
You should have told him .
I &apos;m a doctor .
I don &apos;t think she can speak French .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
You should &apos;ve gone home already .
I &apos;m so happy for you two .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
No one knows where Tom is .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m here .
Tom looks like you .
Could you say that again ?
Tom has to do that before Monday .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
It gets better .
I have to go alone .
Tom won &apos;t be here much longer .
We can &apos;t do it .
I saw her a week ago today .
Where is the boy ?
Tom looked very young .
How did you hit on that ?
I used to do that every day .
Tom was home .
What were they doing there ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
Tom is getting better .
He did it for fun .
That &apos;s too much .
I have to go to sleep .
We all know .
What have you been doing this week ?
I hope you know it doesn &apos;t really matter all that much .
I already told Tom that .
Tom isn &apos;t my father .
I let Tom do that yesterday .
We have enough time .
I &apos;m there for you .
I &apos;ll tell you why I don &apos;t like Tom .
Why did she come home early ?
I &apos;ll be coming back tonight .
That isn &apos;t it .
I want a person who can speak French .
I should &apos;ve been there .
He came home at ten .
I wanted to be with you .
He will not be back tomorrow .
Your family needs you .
My brother is in Australia now .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to school ?
I &apos;ll never see her again .
What Tom really wanted was to be happy .
Tom is going to do that again .
Why don &apos;t you have a look ?
Tom said that .
I thought you &apos;d want to see this .
Tom heard nothing .
It &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
I love doing that .
What does she do ?
I went to the room .
I fell into the water .
No one knows her name .
Tom looks like his mother .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait so long .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what to do .
They look like us .
Where is your homework ?
You are old enough to know this .
I &apos;ve all but finished doing that .
Tom is like family .
You are my friend .
You can &apos;t see Tom today .
I &apos;ll say it again .
I &apos;m not going to work with you today .
I &apos;d like to give it to Tom .
You &apos;d better go .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary just said that .
Tom knew nothing about it .
What did you do with them ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like doing that .
Tom wrote this book .
French is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
I want Tom to do that .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
Tom arrived yesterday .
Tom is working on your car .
They &apos;re not here .
I asked Tom a question .
When will you visit me again ?
Tom and Mary often sing together .
Tom was surprised by what Mary said .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
Come on up , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t seem surprised .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary .
Where did you see her ?
I know that I know it , but I can &apos;t remember it .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
Tom knew how important doing that was to me .
I got my hair done yesterday .
Are you finished here ?
I want to speak with you .
It &apos;s possible , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a family .
I see what &apos;s going on .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom .
She knows my wife .
It was a mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t seem all that surprised .
You may take this .
Can you take me home now ?
How did you learn French ?
Her idea is better than yours .
I think I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
What am I to do ?
I &apos;ve never heard Tom say anything like that .
He might come tomorrow .
Tom went into the house .
Tom has gone to Boston .
It was my first job .
A beer , please .
Tom is doing well now .
Tom said he was asked to leave .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
Why are these people in here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
You &apos;re the one I love .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
Tom asked Mary why she was so late .
Tom is living in Boston .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
I am a man .
Why didn &apos;t you come to yesterday &apos;s party ?
I want to help if I can .
I thought I could help Tom , but I couldn &apos;t .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I know .
I &apos;ll give you my opinion .
I have a job for you .
I &apos;d like to be alone now .
I &apos;d like to know where you are .
You &apos;ll like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to do that anymore .
I was having dinner with Tom .
Mary used to be beautiful .
It &apos;s too cold .
&quot; Why did Tom do that ? &quot; &quot; Do what ? &quot;
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t hear you well .
May I leave this book with you ?
I used to be like you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time .
I want to know your name .
Why don &apos;t you go to school ?
When will we meet ?
Tom isn &apos;t as rich as his friends think he is .
What does it look like ?
I already feel better .
It can &apos;t be true .
I told Tom why I wanted to do that .
I &apos;m going to go there with Tom .
I &apos;ve already seen that movie .
You aren &apos;t me .
It &apos;s late .
You have to help us .
I &apos;ll be doing that with Tom .
I might see Tom tomorrow .
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
The old man has enough money .
Do you know what these are ?
This happened before .
Did Tom buy it ?
I can &apos;t just do nothing .
Tom looked at Mary .
I won &apos;t go there anymore .
I &apos;ve got a job .
We &apos;re going to try .
Where will we meet ?
I don &apos;t know how other people do it .
I &apos;m not sure yet .
I knew Tom was busy .
What &apos;s that look like to you ?
That &apos;s not the only problem .
He will be back in ten minutes .
He asked me if I was busy .
Tom is with me .
They aren &apos;t like us .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has to do that or not .
Tom is still in Boston .
What was Tom &apos;s answer ?
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
How do you like it ?
Have you done this kind of thing before ?
I think I won &apos;t go to work today .
I &apos;d like to hear what your opinion is .
This would be a mistake .
You always say that .
Tom has a lot of friends to help him .
Is Tom from Boston ?
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
I don &apos;t want to see this again .
He will be here soon .
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Australia .
Tom said that he never said that .
I got here as soon as I could .
You &apos;re going to do fine .
Is that really true ?
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
I never want to see your face again .
Tom ate something .
I have to talk to Tom now .
I know it &apos;s not easy .
Tom asked for some water .
It &apos;s not there .
How long have we been here ?
They don &apos;t have a car .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting .
I went there .
Tom says he &apos;s happy .
What do you think is going on ?
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
He is good at playing tennis .
He asked me two questions .
Tom is going to know what to do .
It was your idea .
It &apos;s my money .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy .
I &apos;ve been here before .
He seems quite happy .
It &apos;s more than enough .
I feel very good .
I have to go now .
Do what he says .
Why are you doing this to yourself ?
Tom is hardly ever at home .
Tom , answer the door .
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner .
Tom wants to speak .
Did Tom say what happened exactly ?
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know those people .
I want someone to tell me why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
How old is your dog ?
He may have said so .
Can I eat this ?
Let go of me !
We &apos;ve never done it before .
I just hope no one saw me .
I wish it had been that easy .
I can &apos;t remember where I first met Tom .
I can &apos;t hear a word Tom is saying .
He will not go .
I &apos;m surprised Tom isn &apos;t with Mary now .
I know next to nothing .
It was cold outside .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
Tom had to stay at home all week .
He may not come .
What else does Tom want ?
We have to be there .
I still can &apos;t believe it happened .
Tom likes you a lot .
Have you already read this book ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a bad idea .
Where &apos;s your car ?
It &apos;s what Tom would want .
My brother is out .
I &apos;m not happy .
He will be very busy next month .
I can &apos;t talk .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
Tom had to go there alone .
Tom says he &apos;s not going to do that .
What does Tom want with me ?
The job &apos;s not done yet .
I know why you want this job .
Did Tom say why he was here ?
I can come .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me all day .
His girlfriend did it for him .
They &apos;re not going to stop .
You said that last time .
Tom had nothing left to drink .
I know your father very well .
Tom seemed to have many friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can speak French .
Is this your beer ?
Tom can swim fast .
Tom wanted more .
I don &apos;t want to work here anymore .
Can you read French ?
I cannot read French .
We &apos;ll tell Tom .
I &apos;m OK .
Tom always works a lot .
I &apos;m not sure why .
Tom will do that tomorrow , too .
Tom will know what this is .
Don &apos;t be sorry .
Please tell me your name .
We &apos;re sure that it was an accident .
I saw that , too .
I can &apos;t quite understand .
If anyone can do it , Tom can .
You &apos;ve been at it for hours .
You &apos;re very busy .
This is what he said .
We &apos;re not surprised .
Give me your hand .
Tom has made a mistake .
That &apos;ll be possible .
I wish we had more time .
I know you have it .
That &apos;s not what I mean .
He told me that he would see it once more .
What &apos;s Tom doing in there ?
Where were you an hour ago ?
Do you have any idea what &apos;s wrong ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to go , does he ?
Mary said that she wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s daughter .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop doing that .
I didn &apos;t say anything .
I can &apos;t get along with him .
I wish I could understand French .
They need help .
What is it that you want from me ?
Tom is your friend .
I &apos;ll get to it .
Is her father a teacher ?
I expect that Tom will do more .
They &apos;re very , very good .
I was away .
Tom said he &apos;s not doing it .
Tom came along much later .
Tom would wait .
It &apos;s not true .
You drive .
Tom looks like his brother .
We don &apos;t get on well with each other .
How hard can this be ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
My mother always says she &apos;s going to visit me soon .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll show you around .
Who ate ?
We have work to do .
This has nothing to do with what happened here last week .
I bought this book yesterday .
Tom can &apos;t swim .
I only need one thing .
I &apos;d like a table by the window .
It &apos;s not my car .
Tom is coming on Monday .
I thought you were going out with Tom .
He &apos;s a good boy .
I can &apos;t swim as well as Tom .
I &apos;m going and that &apos;s that .
What are you going to say to Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
Can I stay a little longer ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about it right now .
It &apos;s not going to be that easy .
You know this is a mistake .
Where was he born ?
The accident happened two hours ago .
Tom took Mary home .
She could not swim .
You &apos;ll go far .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to his wife .
What do you want , Tom ?
I would like to see it .
They know who they are .
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can .
Where are your children ?
I think I should probably go .
I will never see him .
I thought he was sick .
Tell Tom to get here early .
I did my homework yesterday .
Tom is home alone .
Tom and I both work .
I can &apos;t remember exactly who told me that .
I see why you don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom was thirty .
I don &apos;t need that .
I was ready .
Can you remember his name ?
He often comes late .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary told John .
I can &apos;t agree with you on this matter .
Tom is quite good at his job .
You did it all right .
I think he takes after his father .
How are we going to do it ?
That was Tom .
I &apos;m very busy these days .
Where are we ?
She always gets up early .
I like this house as it is .
Tom told Mary he wasn &apos;t busy .
She gave money .
They don &apos;t know who I am .
Tom will probably come tomorrow .
I &apos;d never have done that that way .
Is Tom with us ?
I &apos;m doing this for Tom .
Can I work here ?
How &apos;s your father ?
Do you let your children drink coffee ?
Tom saw Mary today .
He is far from happy .
I need a doctor .
I don &apos;t think Tom needs our help .
We &apos;ll never work for Tom .
We &apos;re students .
He &apos;s too young to understand .
I thought a lot about what Tom said .
I don &apos;t believe you .
Can he speak English ?
I have nothing to write .
I made that for Tom .
Just give me the phone .
I don &apos;t like those shoes .
I thought he would come .
He had a new idea .
Tom needs you here .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
I can do it now .
You learn quickly .
Tom has come home .
I think I remember how to do that .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s doing now .
It is a little cold .
I can &apos;t drive .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
Come on , let &apos;s go .
This letter &apos;s for me .
I couldn &apos;t sleep .
My mother is out there .
Why don &apos;t you want this ?
I know only this .
Tom is still sick in bed .
Tom knew I was ready .
Tom still speaks French every day .
I know you better than your wife does .
I &apos;m Tom and this is Mary .
Did you have a good time this afternoon ?
When did you go to bed last night ?
Can you put the children to bed ?
This answer makes me angry .
That is all .
You have to go .
I asked you not to play with that .
No one has come .
We &apos;re not going to do that .
I don &apos;t need them anymore .
Did you buy this book ?
Tom was sick last week .
I told my parents everything .
I don &apos;t know what you want to do .
I don &apos;t need any help with my homework .
I know why Tom &apos;s happy .
We &apos;re ready when you are .
It &apos;s not very good .
Tom asked for more money .
Tom wrote the letter himself .
Can I see that ?
Tom &apos;s right .
Tom knows what he wants to see .
We &apos;ll have to do it even if we don &apos;t want to .
What &apos;s in front of you ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything .
What are they saying ?
I don &apos;t know where I am .
It was Tom &apos;s idea .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
Tom and Mary want to get married .
What does this have to do with my family ?
I love you people .
It is time to go to bed .
My mother is making a cake for my father .
I just didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom is the same age as I am .
How do they do that ?
Don &apos;t you feel cold ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like this hotel ?
We don &apos;t have that long .
What have you been doing ?
I wish Tom would learn to speak French .
Maybe I should go .
I know the boy .
What is it with you and Tom ?
Tom goes to Boston every once in a while .
We &apos;re not happy .
I &apos;ll be thinking of you today .
They &apos;re coming .
That &apos;s not what you said last night .
He &apos;s angry at the world .
I can &apos;t read .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
Tom didn &apos;t see anybody .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak much French .
I go to school here , too .
You were always too busy to talk to me .
Would you like for me to make you something to eat ?
No one knew the answer .
What do we do with it ?
I &apos;m already tired .
I just need five minutes .
I &apos;d like a car like yours .
The house has been bought .
That &apos;s all I have .
Tom should have done it the way Mary told him to do it .
You must think of your family .
This isn &apos;t a new car .
I don &apos;t know how many years I have left .
You don &apos;t need to go there if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom never takes the train .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s saying .
Tom can &apos;t get enough of it .
Can you find her ?
Tom knows I want to leave as soon as possible .
Why didn &apos;t anyone come ?
It won &apos;t be as fun as you think .
What if Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to do that ?
We &apos;ve never been to Boston .
Tom came to see you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary everything .
I saw it coming .
Where &apos;s the boy ?
I &apos;m already at work .
Tom used to read a lot .
Would you like to go for a swim with me ?
Tom looks fine .
We need you .
You should listen to your wife .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
I believe you know what I mean .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
He is always on the go .
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
Tom likes that .
Tell Tom why .
Why does Tom want this ?
Can &apos;t you speak French ?
He had no friend to talk to .
Tom and Mary are going to get married next month .
Why is your French so good ?
Let Tom do it .
He is old .
We &apos;ve got to go .
He doesn &apos;t look happy .
What do you want to buy ?
I wasn &apos;t afraid .
I don &apos;t have the money .
Go on .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary what John did .
He asked my mother .
I want to talk to you about last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
You are children .
I would like to come and see you .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
This dog isn &apos;t mine .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
I &apos;m old enough to be your father .
Which cat is yours ?
Tom is about the same age as you are .
Tom is working .
Tom won &apos;t like that answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is happy .
Tom seems to be rich now .
I want to do it right .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really Tom .
I &apos;m very cold .
I thought I heard something outside .
If you want to talk , let &apos;s talk .
Let us go home .
Are we done ?
I &apos;m quite sure of it .
I &apos;m happy where I am .
Mary was like a sister to me .
How is this even possible ?
I &apos;d like to be as rich as Tom .
I don &apos;t know much about your family .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
This looks great .
This is just water .
Tom is the only student at this school that Mary knows .
Tom wants to learn .
Tom said Mary is good at French .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
Tom asked for our help .
This has got to stop .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
Tom knows what happened .
Don &apos;t you have school today ?
We have time enough to eat .
Tom never said a word .
Tom wanted people to like him .
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
I want to be a teacher .
I &apos;m in Boston for a whole week .
Did you really do that ?
Is anybody here ?
Can you stay a bit longer ?
I saw someone .
Do you want to hear the truth ?
I thought you would say that .
I always do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
She doesn &apos;t know how to drive a car .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
They &apos;re going to do it .
Tom lives and works in Boston .
I was tired today .
It has to be there .
I have something good to tell you .
He would not listen to my advice .
We can &apos;t help you .
I can &apos;t give those to you .
I &apos;ve been doing it for years .
He wasn &apos;t even there .
How long does it take to get to the station ?
We aren &apos;t alone .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s already time to go home .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
Tom did it , didn &apos;t he ?
Tom has a new girlfriend already .
She has a few friends .
Tom and I want to see you .
A baby boy was born to them .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
All I think about is you .
How old was Tom in this picture ?
Can you tell me the time ?
Don &apos;t give the dog anything to eat .
It &apos;s been five years since my father died .
What Tom does is his own business .
How beautiful !
Is there anyone you didn &apos;t tell ?
Tom was afraid of Mary .
Where did Tom buy this book ?
I &apos;ll go tomorrow if the weather is good .
Tom knows her .
We never talked about that again .
Please come again .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
They &apos;re happy .
Do it right now .
Where &apos;s Tom going to be ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to be here .
That &apos;s my cat .
What about Tom ?
Tom found one .
I believe in him .
I think I &apos;m OK .
Tom goes to school .
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
I really don &apos;t want to do that .
He left after me .
I do love you .
Who else was at Tom &apos;s party ?
Did you do your homework by yourself ?
Tell Tom about it .
What else did Tom want ?
Do it for Tom .
It &apos;s very hard to understand .
I am very happy .
I &apos;m not going to go there .
You &apos;ll have to go to Boston to meet Tom next week .
They had had that problem before .
I &apos;ve told you the truth .
Tom knows this place .
I &apos;ll see you in Boston .
Do you know how to do that ?
What &apos;re they doing ?
You need not go there .
Where are you now ?
Are they still here ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
I &apos;m not done .
I need some time to myself .
I had dinner with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t remember .
Tell Tom I want to talk to him right away .
Tom has this large room to himself .
It &apos;s just too soon .
It &apos;s a problem .
I hope he will come .
He does not live there any more .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
I heard that Tom is sick .
We have only three days .
I haven &apos;t done that yet .
Tell them what happened .
There is nothing to do today .
I don &apos;t know what more I can say .
I &apos;ve just finished reading that book .
Tom was still in Boston this time last year .
I want to spend more time with my family .
I love going to Boston .
She wouldn &apos;t even speak to him .
Tom put his shoes on .
What is it you want , Tom ?
Tom did it .
What kind of book did you buy ?
I need you in my life .
Tom likes being alone .
I only need Tom .
I don &apos;t have to work on Monday .
She became happy .
What did I do wrong ?
This table is the same as that one .
How often have you done that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I do not love him anymore .
Who is this girl ?
I like tennis .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
We &apos;re friends now .
We live in Boston .
Are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
What did you do with my book ?
I don &apos;t know . What do you think ?
I want them .
Are you free this afternoon ?
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom said to give you this .
I found it there .
Tom saw something .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was this happy .
He asked me whether she was coming .
I &apos;ve only seen Tom once .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave Australia .
When did it happen ?
Tom is always getting people to do things for him .
This isn &apos;t over yet .
You have to help me .
Tom is happy to be home .
I have things I want to do .
Tom has two children .
Let me try .
Did you make it ?
I wish we &apos;d done that .
We both know what happened .
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
Is Tom that good ?
The old man said something .
That was fun .
What &apos;s going on in here ?
You have to stay in bed until next Monday .
Where did Tom learn that ?
You know what , Tom , you &apos;re right .
Stop that !
I don &apos;t know how I did this .
Tom was late for work .
Tom is the one who wants to wait .
Don &apos;t you want these ?
Tom knows that Mary loves John .
They gave it to me .
He bought a new car .
Tom isn &apos;t really sure .
What are you thinking ?
Tom has to listen to us .
The bus stopped .
Let me know if you need my help .
What is it you want to know ?
Are you tired now ?
What &apos;re you doing there ?
I think Tom has made a mistake .
We know that your name isn &apos;t Tom .
I &apos;m here .
I love his son .
What do you expect me to do ?
You have to take this .
I like Tom very much .
Don &apos;t you know what to do ?
They were afraid .
My hair &apos;s too long .
You &apos;ll have to come tomorrow .
All of them speak French .
I still have to do that .
What do I need to do now ?
That is quite possible .
We lost the game .
That &apos;ll do .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
This isn &apos;t my first time to be here .
No one likes me .
She needs to help him .
Let it go , Tom .
It happened .
It &apos;s at home .
Maybe we should help Tom .
Tom went too far .
How about some coffee ?
Your hair is too long .
Tom is sorry .
Did you come here to help me or not ?
I want to watch this .
You aren &apos;t going to tell my parents , are you ?
I don &apos;t think they would &apos;ve done anything .
My mother is sick in bed .
I have nothing to do now .
It made me very happy .
It &apos;s all in the room .
What did you do then ?
I want to see my parents .
I bought a book .
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I like it very much .
You know what I think .
Where are you from ?
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
How is it at school ?
Why aren &apos;t you going ?
He asked me for money .
Tom is almost never busy anymore .
If you want to , we &apos;ll go .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
If I had money , I could buy it .
I don &apos;t know how I did that .
I may be too old .
We &apos;re from Boston .
This question isn &apos;t easy .
Let &apos;s ask him .
I think Tom is here already .
Tom wants three of them .
She kept me waiting for over an hour .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go .
Why are you out here ?
I don &apos;t like school .
I won &apos;t leave .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
You &apos;re not a doctor .
You &apos;re probably the only person who can help me do that .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at home ?
Mary is my girlfriend .
I can &apos;t talk about this now .
Tom &apos;s mother &apos;s name is Mary .
How long were you gone ?
Is that a question ?
It &apos;s too far away .
We were happy .
I see something .
We are not alone .
I think Tom did exactly what he said he did .
What will my parents think ?
If you wish to speak to Tom , you &apos;ll need to wait about three hours .
I love you more than anything .
We &apos;re doing what we want to do .
You &apos;re doing everything wrong .
He &apos;s not always happy .
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston .
We &apos;re surprised .
Do you want to play with Tom ?
Tom and Mary want you there , too .
Where &apos;s your friend ?
Tom couldn &apos;t remember .
Have you found anything ?
I &apos;m not taking Tom &apos;s word for it .
Tom and Mary have been studying French together all afternoon .
This is not a good idea .
I don &apos;t think we have enough time .
I &apos;m not a teacher .
Her father died when she was three .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
The book is here .
Tom changed clothes .
Tom became very sick .
What kind of person is she ?
Which of you did it ?
It looks like Tom isn &apos;t at home .
Tom likes it in Boston .
They &apos;re afraid of Tom .
Do you have a problem with me ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
It was you that made the mistake !
Tom is too busy .
Did you watch the movie ?
What you said surprised me .
I want to forget her .
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
You are no longer a child .
Do you have a child ?
I thought I told you not to come .
She looks very happy .
There &apos;s no beer here .
We &apos;re not like that .
This isn &apos;t French . It &apos;s English .
Are there any other questions ?
I &apos;m sorry about that , Tom .
I am going to see the doctor this afternoon .
May I do it right now ?
Tom wants to come and see you .
Tom didn &apos;t say when he &apos;d be here .
Did you ever talk to him ?
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
All we want to do is eat .
When did he go ?
I only have a few books .
It is time you went to school .
Where &apos;s the park ?
Can you be sure ?
He asked me a question .
Tom only has eyes for Mary .
He has been sick in bed for a week .
What are these doing here ?
He went to the hospital yesterday .
I think Tom knows Mary .
How &apos;s your family ?
I &apos;d never do anything like that .
How old is Tom now ?
How did he find us ?
I can &apos;t stop thinking about it .
I know you said that .
He &apos;s now on the phone .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
Don &apos;t make a mistake .
Who &apos;s here ?
That isn &apos;t good .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary are getting married .
They &apos;re there .
Tom asked Mary for advice .
They won &apos;t come until tomorrow .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
That &apos;s a good question .
Did Tom ever talk about his father ?
I bought a new car for Tom .
Tell me what to do with it .
I don &apos;t think I want that .
Have you eaten dinner ?
I let go of Tom &apos;s hand .
I know her .
We &apos;re parents .
I can &apos;t walk .
The answer to this question is easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
I don &apos;t understand much about it .
He had fun with her .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
I need a new car .
If anybody can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
I think I &apos;ve seen enough .
I knew there would be something to eat .
When did you learn to swim ?
I like this one .
I didn &apos;t know what else to say to Tom .
You have what they want .
Did Tom say where we should meet him ?
It was big .
I can do this alone .
Come on , it &apos;s easy .
She went home .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d help him .
I think he won &apos;t come .
Did Tom go alone ?
What &apos;re you doing in Boston ?
Tom is three years old now .
Tom will work .
Is that so bad ?
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
You have many books .
My family lives here .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I &apos;ve said all I have to say .
I know you are rich .
Tom is playing .
I &apos;m not happy about that .
Tom and Mary have gone .
I read the whole book in one day .
Tom might be late .
Do you really want Tom to do this for you ?
I asked why .
I was very happy to hear the news .
Don &apos;t give me anything .
I like this school .
What do you think of this work ?
You look like my sister .
What would the world do without tea ?
Tom has a lot of money , but he has no friends .
I &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s Tom .
I don &apos;t want to play with Tom .
Tom has what he wants .
What about us ?
Tom told me that he was sick .
Tom asked Mary to buy him something to eat .
Tom looks like his father .
Where do you really live ?
I don &apos;t want to read this book .
Tom said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t hear you .
He did not have enough money .
He came to my office yesterday .
Tom can &apos;t speak much French .
Tom never saw her again .
This is my sister , Mary .
Who asked you to help ?
Tom said that he had been busy .
Tom looks nice .
He needs you .
Tell them the truth .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet been found .
I can &apos;t remember where I bought it .
They &apos;re gone .
I couldn &apos;t help Tom do that .
All of them went there .
I don &apos;t think I want to talk about it .
I &apos;ll sleep in my room .
Tom wants a large family .
This book is better than any I have ever read .
Please find Tom .
You need not do it at once .
Who do you think it is ?
Tom made his mother happy .
I don &apos;t know what Tom is doing .
Tom is a good friend of mine .
I asked Tom a few questions .
Tom went back to sleep .
You &apos;ll be happy again .
I &apos;m busy all the time .
We love having Tom back .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants to do .
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early .
The answer was easy .
Tom can &apos;t go home until after 2 : 30 .
He did it as he had been told .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
This really is something .
Tom came yesterday .
Who wrote the letter ?
I need more room .
Tom isn &apos;t with me .
He bought it for five dollars .
You can &apos;t say that .
I &apos;m making coffee .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary and she won &apos;t talk to him .
You don &apos;t know a thing about me .
Do you want to hear it ?
I had no idea what to do .
Tom could write his name when he was three years old .
I want to know who did this .
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
I will never be your friend .
I think I know him .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have enough money to buy that .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home .
He gave me his word .
I &apos;m sure Tom is OK .
I will help you when I have finished my work .
Tom had only three dollars with him .
Give me what you have in your hand .
I &apos;ve got nothing .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I was ready for Tom .
Tom speaks French well .
He did it himself .
She seems to be sick .
I had nothing else to do .
Tom looks ready .
I need 30 minutes .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better .
I &apos;m not doing that today .
You &apos;re my girlfriend .
Are you out there ?
Let me say one thing .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to say .
We lost .
I may not come .
Did you tell Tom that ?
Tom kept me waiting for a long time .
I stopped working for Tom three years ago .
I &apos;ll wait for you .
I don &apos;t think this is how it &apos;s done .
She gave him some food .
Tom is very busy .
Let me ask you something .
I want to take Tom with me .
I bought this for my girlfriend .
I have a bicycle .
Tom wants to be with us .
Nobody &apos;s ever heard of him .
Tom has everything he needs .
I have something else to show you .
Can you please say that again ?
Tom has already gone to bed .
I don &apos;t want to eat any more .
Tom was very good .
He did exactly as I had told him .
We &apos;ll talk about that later .
It is important for me .
This is the house that he lives in .
What &apos;s up , Tom ?
We only have three days left .
Is that all Tom told you ?
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
I asked him to drive me home .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
I don &apos;t want to be with you .
You should stay in bed .
Where do you see yourself in five years ?
Why do I have to give this to you ?
Tom is going to love being here .
How do you want me to do that ?
She took her own life .
Can &apos;t you do it ?
I was just going to do that .
Tom wants to do it .
Tom and Mary usually get home later than their parents do .
Tom won &apos;t like this .
Tom is too old for you .
Can we come ?
I &apos;ve still got a lot of work to do .
Tom thought about it .
I &apos;ve got to go back to Boston tomorrow .
I &apos;m going home .
I made that one .
Tom came to my office yesterday .
Did you like Tom ?
I don &apos;t have much time now .
You look happy today .
What do I look like ?
What do you want to do in the afternoon ?
You &apos;ve got my phone .
Tom , I want to go to sleep .
I need to go back to Australia .
I won &apos;t forget .
I wish I could have gone with her .
He is not there .
Why do you want to learn French ?
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is .
Tom said Mary was too busy to help us .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do this .
I never thought I would get married .
Can you really swim ?
Tom and I went to school together .
Tom didn &apos;t know a thing about it .
I think I found a problem .
Do you want to know the truth ?
How old are you ?
I &apos;m able to speak French .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
All you have to do is to meet her there .
Why do I have to do this ?
Tom could &apos;ve said something .
Tom wanted to learn to read .
There &apos;s nothing more to say .
Tom is too good for Mary .
This is not about money .
I &apos;m sure Tom will be here soon .
Tom can only get better .
Tom isn &apos;t a child anymore .
How is that possible ?
Her story is true .
Tom now lives in Boston .
When I saw him last , he was still a child .
I saw your father .
He was very happy .
Could you show me the way to the station ?
He bought her a dog .
You must do it this way .
His house is by the river .
I &apos;m too busy to talk with Tom right now .
I wish I could remember it .
Tom said he may do that .
I like how you think .
What do you enjoy doing ?
The work was all but finished .
I know how angry you are .
We lost it .
What does Tom want to eat ?
That hat looks good on you .
That &apos;s just the way he is .
Who else could &apos;ve done it ?
I &apos;m going to wait here for Tom .
How much money does he have ?
I &apos;d like you to go there .
Tom ran out of water .
I can do this myself .
I wish that had never happened .
I &apos;m happy to see you .
I really need to talk to you .
I want to meet with Tom .
This one &apos;s for you .
That &apos;s not a cat . That &apos;s a dog .
There &apos;s someone at the door .
You were never alone .
We study English at school .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Are they gone ?
Would you stop that , please ?
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
Tom &apos;s family is rich .
It &apos;s better that way .
Your French is getting much better .
What will become of me ?
They can &apos;t hear you .
I should learn some French .
I love you just the way you are .
He should come right away !
Tom can &apos;t help it .
I think you look like Tom .
It &apos;s easy .
I know where you want to be .
Tom did it for money .
I will be gone by the time she comes back .
I can &apos;t believe Tom said that .
I don &apos;t really understand why .
Tom and Mary are still working .
This book is mine .
I know where to find water .
This is going to be easy .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off Mary .
Tom seems really happy .
I &apos;ve got enough money for a car .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can drive or not .
It &apos;s a good question .
He went to Boston by car .
How often do you read books ?
Everyone loves their father .
What did Tom give Mary ?
You &apos;re not watching .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done that .
This is not my problem .
Tom loves children .
I don &apos;t have much time left .
You &apos;re going to be fine .
I think I know that girl over there .
There is nothing here .
Have you seen that movie ?
No one here can swim .
My father became old .
I don &apos;t remember exactly what Tom said .
Did you watch the game ?
I want to know where Tom lives .
It won &apos;t come to that .
There are hardly any books in this room .
Tom looked tired , but happy .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
How are your parents doing ?
She has been sick in bed for a week .
I &apos;ve told you everything .
Where &apos;s everyone else ?
You seem tired . You should go to bed .
Tom is home now .
That &apos;ll make Tom very happy .
I wrote that book .
He &apos;s no doctor .
We &apos;ll meet Tom there .
Tom loves me .
I like your thinking .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Mary ?
How can I get there ?
I love my mother .
Tom said he &apos;d come tomorrow .
Tom told me what he wanted .
That does it .
Let Tom speak .
Tom may be home on Monday .
I thought I could do it .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I &apos;d still like to have coffee with you .
I have something that I want to say to you .
I &apos;ll see you Monday .
I want to help you .
It didn &apos;t last more than three minutes .
What does Tom want from me ?
Did Tom give you anything ?
We have to do that this week .
Don &apos;t you want to swim today ?
You have one hour .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time .
That doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom isn &apos;t looking too good .
I have got to go now .
We &apos;re very sorry .
I &apos;m thinking of you .
I know where Tom lives .
What are you doing now ?
I don &apos;t think so .
How long do we stop here ?
That &apos;s what I like about you .
You and I aren &apos;t like that .
We can get what we want without your help .
I cannot understand what you say .
Tom should tell Mary that .
I just want to have fun .
Tom knows my wife .
Did you find another picture ?
I think you &apos;re doing that wrong .
Tom was a little surprised .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t coming .
I didn &apos;t have enough time to do what I wanted to do .
Is that the train I have to take ?
What do you want me to do there ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
Where is your room ?
Tell me what happened .
I need to know where you are .
Tom and Mary are playing tennis now .
I have no idea what that is .
Tom did it for me .
Tom didn &apos;t think it was right .
I don &apos;t think this is such a good idea .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I already knew that .
May I speak to Tom ?
You don &apos;t want this .
He was angry with himself .
They &apos;re after me .
He won &apos;t talk to her and she won &apos;t talk to him .
We &apos;re just good friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to drink anything else .
I need to be sure that you understand this .
Tom has never done anything like this before .
Why wait until Monday ?
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet , have they ?
Tom will see Mary today .
Can you do that again ?
Tom went back home .
Nobody knows why .
That girl is Mary .
Tom will never have to worry about money .
You &apos;d like it .
Tom has big eyes .
I &apos;d like to be alone .
Let &apos;s have a party tonight .
Tom tried to talk to us in French .
We &apos;re still very busy .
This isn &apos;t Australia .
Tom saw Mary with John .
Let &apos;s eat out .
I have to go back .
Why would anyone do such a thing ?
We &apos;d better find it .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t find a job .
I want to know what it is .
I hope he &apos;ll get better soon .
I &apos;ll finish it in two or three minutes .
I wish I could write as well as Tom .
What do you want to ask me ?
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help .
You should go to the doctor .
Tom wants me to do it .
I must find Tom .
Tom wants to help .
Tom and Mary are good people .
You should &apos;ve let me help you .
Why would I say anything ?
Do it quickly .
He could not speak French well .
Tom has a car .
We need a plan .
You &apos;re not going to like this .
I &apos;m going to be ready in five minutes .
You made a mistake .
This is not true .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thought .
Who is the father ?
Come back in an hour .
I &apos;ll never forget .
I don &apos;t want to live with that .
Tom wants to go to Boston .
Why did you tell Tom Mary didn &apos;t like him ?
How would you help Tom ?
Maybe you should ask around and see what other people think .
How many people are here today ?
Are you with us , Tom ?
He did not know what to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what time it is .
I &apos;ll be with Tom and Mary .
Tom can do it better than I can .
She is too young to go to school .
I have to be here .
I can help you if you let me .
I think Tom knows French .
Tom has a lot of things he has to do .
I &apos;m still in school .
Tom knows what this is .
Do your homework .
You can &apos;t talk to Tom like that .
I &apos;m going to go with Tom .
That &apos;s not an answer .
I think it &apos;s true .
Are you ready to go out ?
I can &apos;t think of everything .
I don &apos;t know what has happened to him .
There &apos;s nothing else to do .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t know where we are .
That &apos;s no good .
I &apos;m hardly ever home .
All we want is for you to be happy .
I don &apos;t know when he will come .
I thought you said Tom was your brother .
I don &apos;t know why Tom got sick .
I met your girlfriend .
Tom asked Mary what she had been doing all morning .
I &apos;ve never heard such a thing .
I thought about my family .
How is it going ?
I know what it is .
Who said it was going to be easy ?
Tom bought Mary a dog .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do .
He lives on this street .
I have to finish my homework before dinner .
I want to know where Tom is .
I think you &apos;d like it .
She was very beautiful when she was young .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
Let &apos;s finish the job .
I &apos;ll give it to you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know him .
You need to help me .
We must find it .
She needs it .
No one else could do my work .
I think we &apos;d better be going .
I am a teacher .
I don &apos;t know if I should believe Tom or not .
Tom took Mary to the train station .
I &apos;m not ready for it yet .
That &apos;ll be fine .
Tom doesn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
I &apos;m sorry . I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Do you know anything ?
You look tired .
You &apos;d better leave .
Have you seen my new car ?
Tom had one daughter .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to help Mary ?
I know that Tom is out .
He won &apos;t like this .
It &apos;s almost time .
Tom can &apos;t stop it .
Tom can &apos;t be sick .
Everyone knows everyone .
How good are they ?
I need some time .
Please think it over .
I wonder who &apos;s going to be at the party .
What about you ?
You don &apos;t have to come .
I need a little more time .
I had to stay in bed for a while .
Tom wants to be here .
She began to sing .
Tom told Mary the truth .
Why do you want to do this ?
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
He cannot swim .
I had to talk to Tom .
We have three children .
I couldn &apos;t get it .
I have to speak with Tom .
No one knows what &apos;s really going on .
I want to see you in my office this afternoon .
He still wants to come .
That &apos;s what I told them .
We &apos;ll take Tom with us .
It &apos;s very cold today .
I have to write a letter .
Tom is in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t go home last night .
He made us do the work .
I can &apos;t help you .
Are you sure this is what you want ?
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
Tom is never going to ever forget Mary .
It hasn &apos;t been that long .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary .
I know what you did in Australia .
Tom works very hard , but not as hard as Mary .
It &apos;s time to go home now .
Tom isn &apos;t at home .
I would like to come to your party .
Tom has never been back to Boston .
Tom was late again this morning .
We don &apos;t need them .
Are you alone right now ?
Tom and Mary are in Tom &apos;s car .
I forgot his name .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom sat alone .
We had a really fun time .
How can I forget it ?
You &apos;re a good man .
Why didn &apos;t she tell me ?
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
She didn &apos;t go far .
Tom gave us everything he had .
Maybe they know something .
We want to live here .
Tom is very busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
They are all very busy .
We must leave right away .
What is all this ?
We are worried about you .
How are you going ?
Did Tom go home ?
What do you know about him ?
I wanted to read a book .
What do you think I want ?
I didn &apos;t mean that to happen .
I like tea .
I think Tom and Mary are going to be so happy together .
Tom has to be here .
Tom saw us do that .
She &apos;s eating for two .
It &apos;s time for me to be on my way .
Is Tom at school ?
You will be able to see him tomorrow .
I think you can do better than that .
I know Tom is a doctor .
I &apos;m not going to help Tom .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
These are my students .
Tom has enough time .
I don &apos;t know what to do about Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has enough money to buy that .
How &apos;s your mother ?
She has a bicycle .
That doesn &apos;t happen .
My friends won &apos;t talk to me anymore .
What &apos;re you doing with this ?
I &apos;m as old as you .
We &apos;ll work .
He looks like his mother .
They are very far away .
Tom is very happy here .
Tom has been doing that for a number of years .
I &apos;ve never heard my mother sing .
Don &apos;t you know how ?
All my friends do it .
You &apos;re not Tom .
If that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
What &apos;s wrong with these people ?
No one knows that .
His story is true .
We &apos;ve got each other .
Tom is under the bed .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like it .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait long .
He knows the city well .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where we are .
You need us .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
I ran out of money .
I wonder if something has happened .
You don &apos;t look very good .
Tom is old enough to drive a car .
There &apos;s very little we can do now .
I can &apos;t help Tom with his homework .
These are for you , Tom .
I just finished reading the book .
They already know .
Tom is very happy .
This is my school .
He always wants to have the last word .
Just give me what I want .
How &apos;s your wife ?
I know Tom is fine .
Tom came to help .
May I speak to you alone ?
He does this all the time .
Tom has a sister .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know he was rich .
Tom is going to need my help .
I , too , am a teacher .
They lost again .
Let the boy go .
They &apos;re coming to the park by bus .
I just got home from school .
Do you know what they said ?
That makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ll never forget you .
I don &apos;t know what kind of car Tom has .
I like it out here .
Tom isn &apos;t coming home with us .
He likes music very much .
You did so much better this time .
That &apos;s what we do here .
Can all your children speak French ?
There is no other way .
What are you going to do with it ?
This was all a mistake .
Tom is doing that for Mary .
It &apos;s not difficult to speak French .
How long has it been since you &apos;ve been to Australia ?
I can &apos;t talk about that right now .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
Why are they doing this ?
Tom looked good today .
The question is how much .
Where will your friends sleep ?
This is difficult to do .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that today .
Tom is in there with Mary and John .
Do you know how to drive ?
That &apos;s the only way .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen the picture yet .
Have you found something ?
Tom is as old as Mary .
We &apos;ll make it .
Tom likes living in Boston .
I don &apos;t remember what time Tom told me to meet him tomorrow .
We don &apos;t want you with us .
I was with Tom the night he died .
I haven &apos;t heard from him for a long time .
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
Do you have a table ?
Tom really should be in bed .
It must be here .
There seems to be a mistake .
They &apos;ll find him .
I think Tom knows things that we don &apos;t .
Nobody wants to do that .
Tom is good to me .
Tom said Mary is very tired .
I &apos;d like you to stop .
Where do I find that ?
Tom is very sorry .
I want to know how you did it .
I didn &apos;t buy the book .
How many people are there in this office ?
I think his name is Tom .
Are you students at this school ?
We &apos;ve done everything possible .
I have to take off .
She is looked up to by her friends .
Nobody knows where Tom is .
Is that all you have ?
How else can we do this ?
Did you talk to Tom ?
I can &apos;t see Tom .
I know where he lives .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
Tom and Mary were here .
Are you through with your work ?
My mother is always busy .
I should learn French .
Give it to Tom .
This would be better than that .
I go to school because I want to learn .
Tom takes the bus to the city .
Is that the plan ?
I &apos;m your father .
This bus will take you to the station .
This is a hospital .
I want to talk to Tom .
He seems to have left the country .
Tom wanted to meet me .
I was too surprised to speak .
Tom was never happy .
Tom only saw Mary once .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I &apos;ll show you what I can do .
I don &apos;t know anything about Boston .
I was happy to do it , Tom .
Tom says that he wants me to go to Boston with Mary .
I already have a plan .
I didn &apos;t ask for help .
You didn &apos;t get very far .
I think Tom said he was from Boston .
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston ?
Tom won &apos;t speak to Mary .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me .
She lost a book .
Tom knew that Mary was rich .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be gone long .
I &apos;m not at all surprised .
Tom gets up early every morning .
Why does it have to be me ?
Tell me what really happened .
Tom is a very close friend .
Tom should know .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
Do you study French at school ?
I am too busy to go .
I &apos;ll give it a go .
I &apos;m not here because of that .
I believe anything is possible .
I know you &apos;re here .
You shouldn &apos;t go to work .
You &apos;ve made a mistake .
He , and he alone , must go .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a lot to give .
I got up early in the morning .
I &apos;m still in love with you .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for Mary ?
This is a very busy station .
Are these yours ?
Do you know what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary doing that .
What was I saying ?
Tom didn &apos;t say where or when to meet him .
The weather &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
We &apos;re just friends ?
Tom could write his name when he was three .
I have to wait .
Tom was very busy all day .
I need to buy one .
I &apos;ve had enough .
You and Tom are good friends , right ?
Is that your house ?
Tom is not my friend anymore .
Tom is really sorry .
This is what Tom wants .
Tom knew that what he did was wrong .
Tom was surprised how well Mary could swim .
You &apos;re still young .
I just wanted you to know that .
Do it Monday .
I knew you &apos;d understand .
Can Tom walk ?
Can I say something now ?
I know almost nothing about Boston .
Tom got everything he wanted .
I &apos;ll always remember you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
I was sick .
I had to stay at home .
We have everything here that we need .
She will never talk about it .
I &apos;ll be there Monday .
We didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
Tom said he was going to Australia .
I don &apos;t want anything to do with that .
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I thought it was true .
I &apos;ll never be your friend .
Tom has never been sick .
I wish I &apos;d kept up my French .
How did you learn that ?
I need to go to work .
Don &apos;t ask me what it was .
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
I would like that .
Tom is in the hospital .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
He &apos;s too old for me .
Tom has told us everything we need to know .
I hardly even know you .
I know Boston .
I don &apos;t have much money on me .
Tom no longer has to do that .
I think I might be able to speak French better than Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t where he wants to be .
I don &apos;t understand the question .
I &apos;m angry with her .
You have to believe in something .
They &apos;ll come to us .
Tom loves the new house .
I know that Tom is happy .
You know why we &apos;re here .
Tom has been busy since this morning .
I &apos;m with him .
Nobody knows this .
You wouldn &apos;t want that to happen , would you ?
Tom is coming .
I &apos;m not sure how that happened .
Tell Tom I &apos;d like to talk to him .
I don &apos;t think she would understand it .
I &apos;m here because of you .
I did it the way he told me to .
There &apos;s nothing to do here .
We should not have done that . It was wrong .
I wonder why she didn &apos;t tell him about it .
No one will believe me .
They aren &apos;t here .
I think that &apos;s Tom .
It &apos;s never too late .
I have a lot of things to do .
I &apos;m going there alone .
I can &apos;t do what you want .
You must always do what is right .
It &apos;s cold today .
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
Please don &apos;t use French .
Please let me go home .
Thank you for doing this .
The dog needs water .
I want you to want me .
I have no problem with this .
I came because of Tom .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
They know who I am .
What did you do wrong ?
Tom is not happy about this .
I &apos;ve never been late before .
I don &apos;t understand this question at all .
Do you want me to help you or not ?
It doesn &apos;t make Tom happy .
Tom looked at Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything .
I &apos;m not in the office today .
He &apos;s her friend .
Tom left an hour ago .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with Mary .
What &apos;s going on with you , Tom ?
It &apos;s about time I was going home .
I couldn &apos;t stand .
Tom knew what Mary wanted to buy .
I &apos;ve already done that once today .
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
Tom likes doing that here .
Tom wants to learn to swim .
Tom has said he has to do that .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t eat that .
I have to go do this .
What do you know about it ?
Tom is not who you think he is .
He took me by the hand .
You must be tired .
Who will come with me ?
He must have been rich .
That &apos;s your problem .
I may not have time .
Why do I have to do that ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
Tom never gets sick .
I can &apos;t listen to this anymore .
He can come .
I always wanted to do that .
It &apos;s time for us to go .
Why are these people here ?
Is Tom outside ?
Tom didn &apos;t have any money .
Why are we here again ?
Tom said he saw Mary doing that .
That isn &apos;t what I want to see .
Tom must be over thirty .
I want you to see her .
It seems that he &apos;s happy .
This isn &apos;t money .
I have something to show you .
You can &apos;t have the job .
Don &apos;t let Tom drink beer .
I just came from my house .
When Tom &apos;s happy , I &apos;m happy .
I will do what I need to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that at all .
Why don &apos;t we ask his advice ?
I won &apos;t help Tom again .
The police are after me .
The car is very fast .
I get it .
He works all night .
I &apos;m better .
Let &apos;s go home , Tom .
Tom has a daughter .
Tom left five minutes ago .
Where could he be ?
They won &apos;t find you .
There were a lot of people there .
I read a book .
I &apos;d like to go to Boston .
Tom lives here alone .
Thank you for coming early .
Why do you want to do that ?
Are you in Australia ?
I don &apos;t want to spend any more time in Boston .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom is up .
How is Tom now ?
The big question is why .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows exactly how that happened .
Let &apos;s meet again soon .
Did Tom give it to you ?
You know that I like you .
You are my father .
Tom didn &apos;t study at all .
Could you please stop saying that ?
Is there someone who could help me ?
How do I look ?
I know what they &apos;re going to do .
We have no school today .
I took the money .
I need to put the children to bed .
Tom wants to live in Boston .
Is that true ?
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
Do you know where we are ?
Tom is right .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
How did Tom find us ?
Are those yours ?
This book is too difficult for me .
There is still much more to be done .
We &apos;re almost done .
Why do you think Tom likes it ?
I &apos;ll show you around the town .
I think Tom needs me .
How would you like your coffee ?
I &apos;d like to show you something .
I have to get home .
Why isn &apos;t that good ?
What &apos;s wrong with this ?
Everyone needs friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t live far away .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
Let me sleep for another ten minutes .
You can come .
Where did Tom eat ?
How did the party go ?
Please have someone else do it .
Tom can &apos;t walk .
That &apos;s really a great idea .
I love it here .
I think it &apos;s a good idea .
I don &apos;t know whether he will come or not .
I have to do it again .
Tom can &apos;t speak any French .
How did you come up with that answer ?
Can you see that ?
Tom did this .
What else ?
It &apos;s not like I want you here .
You know Tom won &apos;t do that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has to do that .
Tom can &apos;t swim very well .
We will talk over the matter later .
How cold is it ?
You &apos;re just like your father .
He has gone too far .
We tried .
I think you &apos;d better leave .
I need to get back home now .
That doesn &apos;t answer my question .
You won &apos;t believe what happened .
Tom wants you .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his way back home .
Tom looks like he &apos;s rich .
He didn &apos;t want to do it .
I had no idea you couldn &apos;t speak French .
He goes there every day .
They are still children .
Tom knows that I don &apos;t like him .
You have to help .
Tom lives alone .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom right now .
It &apos;s time to go to sleep .
Tom &apos;ll wait .
This is all I have to say .
I &apos;m not from Australia .
How are they doing it ?
I gave the boy what little money I had .
No one knows what has happened to him .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know you .
Tom can do that without my help .
Tom didn &apos;t hear anything .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to his advice ?
I want to keep my car there .
I don &apos;t trust you .
Tom &apos;s watching .
Tom can speak French a little .
I &apos;d like to know if that &apos;s true .
Tom may be in Boston .
It isn &apos;t here anymore .
She has more books .
You &apos;re not very happy , are you ?
I want to know what that is .
Tom and Mary both want to say something .
Why doesn &apos;t he tell the truth ?
You make me happy .
Could you tell me how to get to your office ?
They don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom and I are happy .
No one saw me .
I know why Tom is here .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here in Boston .
Is there anything I can do for you ?
I like your idea .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
I see a boy .
I &apos;ve never done it this way before .
We have to talk .
We &apos;re late for school .
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him .
You have my word on it .
It &apos;s good to have you here .
It &apos;s what I want to do .
What are you doing here so early ?
Can I get your help with something ?
English is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
We never swim .
I don &apos;t have time right now .
Tom is already in Boston .
I think Tom is thirty years old .
We know you &apos;re still there .
Tom used to be pretty good at tennis .
Did Tom find it ?
I love you a lot .
I just want to know what happened .
What do you do here ?
Tom &apos;s father died before he was born .
Tom isn &apos;t that young .
My house is very cold .
I &apos;m not a baby anymore .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
This watch is my father &apos;s .
What did you do at that moment ?
I found the money .
Tom hasn &apos;t done anything .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will go .
I am still alone .
This isn &apos;t yours .
I &apos;ve been here for an hour .
I can &apos;t eat any more .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here long .
I will always remember you .
Tom didn &apos;t read the book .
He will come soon .
They &apos;re going to Boston .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
I &apos;ll go when I &apos;m ready .
I didn &apos;t know Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
I can &apos;t say exactly .
Tom has something he wants to say to you .
This one &apos;s from me .
I should like to go for a swim .
I &apos;m not sure I can swim that far .
He doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
Tom said he &apos;d be home for dinner .
I found these .
Tom is from another country .
We &apos;ll be here all day .
I love being with you .
I &apos;m going back .
Tom is not like that all the time .
Why does Tom want to go with us ?
We need the money .
I &apos;m not young anymore .
These are yours .
Did Tom talk to Mary ?
I have a few questions .
I really hope so .
I said what had to be said .
I know how I am .
Tom won &apos;t forget this .
Don &apos;t be like that .
You better go .
Tom is out of work .
You should be in a hospital .
I &apos;m going to do that .
It &apos;s hard to say .
What more can be said ?
I went to school there .
I didn &apos;t sleep at all last night .
I &apos;d love to do it .
Tom told me that he wasn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
I forgot to tell them .
He gave up .
Tom says he knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
What kind of person would do that kind of thing ?
I know why you &apos;re doing this .
I can sleep a lot better now .
Tom has already eaten .
Is that a new car ?
I like them all .
Tom asked Mary where she &apos;d been .
Tom doesn &apos;t like school .
Tom is as busy as ever .
Tom put some clothes on .
He isn &apos;t young .
I love your name .
I think Tom might know something .
They don &apos;t know what they should do with the money .
That &apos;s all for today .
Where can I find Tom ?
There &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
I don &apos;t know what they think .
I think what you need now is to eat something .
When were you in Boston ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like it .
It isn &apos;t hard to do .
They had no idea what needed to be done .
I hope that won &apos;t happen again .
I wonder why Tom went and did something like that .
I &apos;d like to get some sleep .
Tom wants to do that , too .
I bought a watch .
I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;ve been told that often enough .
Tom was rich .
Tom goes to work by car .
Tom wanted to work .
Tom wants Mary to know he likes her a lot .
I &apos;m not going out because I have to do my homework .
I want a car , but I have no money to buy one .
I &apos;ll be there right away .
What about this one ?
What I need is a friend .
Tom wasn &apos;t alone .
It was not an accident .
We &apos;ll use what we have .
She wants to work in a hospital .
I didn &apos;t want that to happen .
Do you want to know why I &apos;m here ?
Who is better at French , Tom or Mary ?
When does Tom go to school ?
That &apos;s not what he said .
Tom asked Mary not to drive so fast .
I will give her the book tomorrow .
I &apos;d like your opinion on this .
Tom and I don &apos;t want that .
It &apos;s fine with me .
I &apos;m hit !
I &apos;m fine .
He told everyone .
I wish you had let Tom go with us .
I had no idea that you were coming .
We understand this .
Where is my money ?
I can &apos;t keep my eyes off of it .
Tom said that yesterday .
I think this one is good .
Tom is in Australia already .
What do you want from me ?
They did what had to be done .
Is that not possible anymore ?
What do you think about this ?
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
I think Mary likes me .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
You aren &apos;t alone anymore .
What will become of her ?
Who gave you this watch ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
I want more of that .
This is a hotel .
He &apos;s done this before .
Where are Tom and his family living now ?
You don &apos;t have to worry about a thing like that .
It &apos;s hard to speak French well .
I took it .
You know that better than I do .
Do you want to know what &apos;s wrong ?
Give that to me .
He asked me to .
He doesn &apos;t know any better .
How can I become rich ?
Don &apos;t worry about us .
I want to go home and sleep .
Tom and Mary are doing their homework .
Where is he playing ?
I can &apos;t do that now .
Why aren &apos;t you in Boston ?
May I ask about your family ?
What will you do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll do that .
I want to see your house .
Why is Tom doing that ?
I really don &apos;t like Tom .
What happened to you last night ?
How long will it take me to finish my homework ?
I &apos;ll be home as soon as I can .
They want us to do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long he &apos;ll have to wait for Mary .
I &apos;ll get there in an hour .
His name is Tom and he &apos;s Mary &apos;s brother .
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
I don &apos;t have as many friends as Tom .
I was really busy .
I have lost my watch .
Tom is in his office .
That &apos;s too long .
You should be a teacher .
I want to live in Australia .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
I never said that .
What do I know ?
Tom does everything well .
I don &apos;t know if it is good .
I &apos;m busy now .
He is alone .
I don &apos;t know why my friend wants us to wait .
Are you sure about that ?
How old do I look ?
I &apos;ll be in the car .
Let me hear it .
He is afraid of making mistakes .
I see nothing wrong with it .
This is good for us .
How long was Tom sick ?
I had fun with it .
We &apos;re going to Boston for a week .
I hope that Tom can wait for us .
I must leave now .
Tom is happy with it .
That &apos;s what Tom wants .
Tom and I are doing fine .
My father is always busy .
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to go .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
He lives in his car .
We want a car .
You have to listen to Tom .
That &apos;s a pretty good question .
Tom was busy .
Tom is getting married next month .
I &apos;m not doing that .
I didn &apos;t see you coming .
We &apos;re not going to leave Mary alone with Tom , are we ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
Is my French really that bad ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t need our help .
This is the house he was born in .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary likes him or not .
Is this Tom &apos;s room ?
I saw one .
I wonder how long Tom has been here .
No one really knows what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;ll do anything for you .
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
He gave me a watch .
We like music .
Tom is at home today .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
The food is ready .
Tom is here .
Tell me something that I don &apos;t know .
Tom told Mary .
Are you a doctor ?
Tom came to see us yesterday .
I don &apos;t swim as well as you do .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom .
Did you just say something to me ?
Tom &apos;s not here .
Tom seemed tired .
We saw them leave .
Did you hear something ?
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
He left the house .
How long have you been in here ?
Tom was born in Boston .
I do hope you &apos;ll come again .
I saw the whole thing .
We &apos;re not going to find anything .
Why don &apos;t we ask Tom &apos;s advice ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
I know what we can do .
I &apos;ve read both books .
Do you know why you &apos;re here ?
Tom was eating .
I wasn &apos;t sure if Tom had eaten yet .
Tom is still working for us .
We can &apos;t help you now .
Can I go now ?
Tom did a pretty good job .
Tom isn &apos;t a good person .
It &apos;s never been done before .
Is he right ?
I think that &apos;s what it is .
I see a book .
I have homework to do .
Why are you going to Boston ?
I &apos;m often here .
Can I help you with that ?
It doesn &apos;t look like anything to me .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
He can hardly speak .
Do you want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
Tom loves to read .
Who would buy this ?
Tom seems to like studying French .
Tom is not our man .
No one saw a thing .
What time , exactly , did Tom leave ?
Tom knows something Mary doesn &apos;t .
How many times have you done this ?
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
No one here has a car .
Tom &apos;s afraid .
It &apos;s not enough .
I &apos;m going to do it .
Who &apos;s going to believe that ?
Is Tom still able to drive ?
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
I wonder where Tom is now .
I have finished my work .
Tom comes to see me once in a while .
I was the only woman .
Tom knows where to find me if he needs me .
Why are the police here ?
Tom and I have both been very busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is in Boston .
That was two years ago .
Tom had no money with him at that time .
My father loves my mother .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with him .
We aren &apos;t going to stay at that hotel again .
This doesn &apos;t happen very often .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this one bit .
I want your money .
I am not a teacher .
How are things at home ?
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
There &apos;s nothing in this room .
What &apos;s going on with you ?
You &apos;d better tell Tom you &apos;re sorry .
Tom needs new shoes .
My parents are old .
Tom seems tired tonight .
I &apos;d like to see you .
I bought this book for myself , not for my wife .
I &apos;ll stop .
I &apos;m very sorry about Tom .
I don &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do that .
Tom never seems to have much to say .
How long &apos;s Tom been gone ?
He has been busy since this morning .
Is that something for me ?
You know where it is , don &apos;t you ?
Why did you say such a thing ?
Come on .
I &apos;ve made a mistake .
You &apos;re a problem .
I can &apos;t remember anyone &apos;s name .
Tom wants to talk .
It was easy to answer .
How old is this dog ?
That &apos;s just what you need now .
How are things with you ?
We want what we want .
It &apos;s great to meet you .
Tom is making his bed .
I told you so .
That &apos;s not exactly what happened .
I don &apos;t really know why he wrote the book .
What does he see ?
I really have to go .
I didn &apos;t eat dinner last night .
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
Are you sure Tom did that ?
I didn &apos;t have a job .
He did not say a word to us .
That man is Tom .
Why don &apos;t you like Tom ?
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s family .
Tom asked Mary not to leave him alone .
Don &apos;t say it again .
There &apos;s only room for one of us .
Tom has done his homework .
You &apos;re Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I think you should tell Tom .
He may not be happy .
Do you know where Tom works ?
You &apos;d better leave now .
Tom knew that .
Can you stay for a few days ?
There &apos;s nothing to it .
Do you want to have some coffee ?
I &apos;m sure he will come tomorrow .
How was your night ?
How many other people are there ?
Tom went with Mary to Boston .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really here .
They were all surprised to see me there .
Let &apos;s go to my place .
Where are we going to meet ?
What are you going to be doing with that ?
Tom wants to go there again .
Why aren &apos;t you at home ?
I just wanted to say that I love you .
I &apos;ve done that once already .
This is a picture of my mother .
Tom thinks he knows why .
How &apos;s the water ?
Tom won &apos;t tell me exactly why he was late .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like me .
It may never happen again .
Have you heard Tom &apos;s music ?
Do you want to go or not ?
Tom has to stay .
I &apos;d leave .
We have no water .
Tom could tell Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
What time is dinner ?
I &apos;ll talk .
We can &apos;t turn back now .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I said that .
When they &apos;re happy , we &apos;re happy .
I &apos;ve known Tom for a long time .
We &apos;ll go .
They all look the same .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
Do they have that ?
I made this for Tom .
It takes time .
Why don &apos;t you help us ?
I went home .
Do you really want to go to Boston with me ?
Who was it that gave you that ?
Tom is busy .
This is the first time that I have been here .
My brother speaks very fast .
Where can I find a hospital ?
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
Don &apos;t give up !
Tom can &apos;t find a job .
I haven &apos;t tried .
Tom looks much better now .
Do you have a family , Tom ?
I don &apos;t want anyone to see me like this .
It &apos;s getting late .
Why do I have to do it ?
Is this your first time here ?
Tell me more .
I &apos;ve already been here two hours .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she didn &apos;t want to .
How &apos;s that possible ?
Tom gave it to Mary .
I heard you talking on the phone .
He speaks really well .
Tom has done a lot for Mary .
It &apos;ll be fine .
Tom said that it might be true .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy here .
No one knows the reason .
That &apos;s not what I think .
You haven &apos;t even tried .
How old is that dog ?
Did anybody else see it ?
I hear you .
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
I want to take Tom home .
What he said made us angry .
He gave me back the money .
He died one year ago .
We don &apos;t know why .
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
There &apos;s nothing more you can do for me .
Do you want me to go without you ?
I really like you a lot .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy here .
We &apos;ll talk later .
You should know it .
What does Tom look like ?
I just met her on the street .
Why are you going to Tom &apos;s again ?
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
What are we doing ?
I need to see you in my office .
He is my brother .
When are you going to work ?
Tom had Mary do that .
Let me do something else .
Tom tried that .
He &apos;s in the hospital .
I want to be there .
Tom said that isn &apos;t the only reason .
Tom likes to do things by himself .
Tom &apos;ll speak .
How do we do it ?
He is doing well .
What are you going to have ?
We tell each other everything .
How could that happen ?
I think you know that .
I don &apos;t want to play with you .
He is able to swim very fast .
That &apos;s what Tom said to Mary .
Why isn &apos;t anybody doing anything ?
No one else knows it .
I &apos;ll go if you go .
I didn &apos;t expect you .
Tom is still here .
How do we do that ?
Tom will never listen to Mary .
It &apos;s too difficult for me .
I don &apos;t want to hear any more .
That &apos;s my answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
I can &apos;t tell you what happened .
I &apos;ve been busy this week .
He tried it with a friend .
I &apos;ve already had a coffee .
I got into town only a week ago .
We know what happened to Tom &apos;s car .
Who &apos;ll drive ?
I &apos;m tired of Boston .
I gave you my answer already .
I &apos;ll see you there .
I want Tom to be happy .
Come with me , please .
I took my hat off .
You &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d think you &apos;d understand .
Tom likes to go to Boston .
I didn &apos;t hear what you said .
This is not my day .
What do you do ?
What do you think of it , Tom ?
We get along really well .
Tom walked through the door .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
I know why you want it .
I thought Tom had already gone home .
I &apos;ll do that later .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
I think Tom can do that .
Tom won &apos;t live long .
Tom has many friends here .
The car is ready .
Tom is the only friend I have .
I go home early every day .
Tom likes Mary , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
There &apos;s nothing I really have to do today .
This book is easy to read .
He doesn &apos;t like us .
No one knows you &apos;re here .
Tom asked a lot of questions .
He did it for the money .
Tom is doing that for the money .
He didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
You &apos;ve got a problem .
Tom didn &apos;t see it .
We know this .
No one will believe us .
I know I &apos;m good enough .
We &apos;re going to my brother &apos;s .
Why are you still up ? You should get to bed .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary .
It &apos;s a long story .
This is not enough .
I no longer need it .
The problem is what we should do with this money .
Tom looks young .
I just want to be happy .
It &apos;s right over here .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Why would Tom want to help us ?
Have you ever lost ?
Come to me .
Tom is doing very well .
I can &apos;t hear what they &apos;re saying .
They don &apos;t speak French here .
Do you have a car ?
That one &apos;s good .
You do what you have to do .
I won &apos;t be here next month .
How did you get into our room ?
That &apos;s quite a story .
Tom is sure Mary is right .
I &apos;m about to turn thirty .
This cat is as big as that one .
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ?
We &apos;re not going out .
I would like to meet his father .
You &apos;ll want to see this .
Tom and Mary want to see us .
There &apos;s so much left for me to learn .
I believe his name is Tom .
What are we doing out here ?
Tom loves you . I know he does .
I &apos;m beautiful .
He is my father .
The movie was really good .
I don &apos;t like the house he is living in .
What was Tom like ?
It &apos;s been tried .
She must be angry .
Tom did well .
I will give you anything you want .
Tom might need to help Mary .
I can only speak for myself .
That looks good on you .
Tom is gone .
I &apos;m going to do it again .
I was very busy this week .
I saw Tom doing it .
What is this car doing here ?
He can &apos;t sing .
She got the money from him .
I &apos;ve just seen Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Tom wanted to leave , but Mary wanted to stay a little longer .
You &apos;re the only friend I have .
We can do a lot better .
That will happen later .
I &apos;ve been here for three days .
Get me some , too .
I think I can help with that .
I know what Tom knows .
I understand Tom .
I get on with him well .
I was at the party .
Why is it so important ?
Can you help me a little ?
This &apos;ll help .
Tom seems to be sick .
I already told Tom everything .
I only wish I could help all of you .
Tom wants to be like his father .
Give me some advice .
The police found Tom &apos;s bicycle .
I will stay home tomorrow .
That should make you happy .
I heard that Tom is going to play tennis with us this afternoon .
How long have you been waiting ?
Please leave Tom alone .
Everyone &apos;s waiting .
Let Tom have his turn .
He doesn &apos;t have to know .
Tom could hardly believe him .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll like that .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Tom isn &apos;t from Boston .
We &apos;re always right .
Tom makes Mary happy .
What &apos;s Tom have to say about this ?
That is the house where I was born .
That has nothing to do with you .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s coming .
Tom is going to do that for you .
I thought you were into it .
Thank you for coming .
Tom had some questions .
Tom didn &apos;t like the new plan .
I will help as much as I can .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
I really like him .
Do you want to take this one ?
I was able to help her .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
I can do it myself .
You were busy .
My father isn &apos;t at home .
Did Tom say why ?
This is from Australia .
I must have made a mistake .
I want to stay home and read a book .
Why did you do that ?
I went to school here .
Let go of my hair .
I don &apos;t know who he is .
It &apos;s good to see you .
I have just finished eating .
Could you come and see me tomorrow ?
Tom asked for my help .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
Who fell ?
Monday &apos;s not good .
Tom was the first one to leave .
Is that from a book ?
Tom asked me what I needed .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
I &apos;m here because I want to be .
They enjoy playing together .
I have a new plan .
Tom is very busy right now .
I &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
I need someone who can speak French .
I think that it &apos;s too big .
You should do that right now .
Tom said he would write to us .
Tom probably did that last Monday .
This is the boy .
How many people know about this ?
You &apos;ve never told me your name .
That &apos;s it .
Tell me what has become of him .
This one is for us .
You know what to do , don &apos;t you ?
Tom is good at playing tennis .
Are you done with your homework yet ?
There &apos;s a letter for you .
I &apos;ll help you all I can .
You really don &apos;t need to do that .
I tried to help .
Why don &apos;t you go ?
Nobody did anything .
I &apos;ve got to speak to you .
I &apos;d like to be friends .
I &apos;ll be there .
Tom did that well .
I know that already .
I had no work yesterday .
I need it today .
Tom and Mary are in the office waiting .
We never go to Boston anymore .
I &apos;m in bed .
Tom and Mary are the same age .
We want you here .
Why aren &apos;t you home ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he is .
I &apos;m in the hospital .
I can &apos;t take Tom &apos;s money .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
My father usually comes home at six .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is .
My French isn &apos;t that good .
I didn &apos;t write that .
Tom made Mary happy .
I want this one .
I tried for almost an hour .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s party .
Tom has it wrong .
He arrived late .
I &apos;m not your father .
When will we go back ?
Tom asked me to help him .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that , is he ?
That &apos;s how he likes it .
Have you read Tom &apos;s book ?
Tom had dinner with Mary .
Don &apos;t you want to go , too ?
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
What &apos;s Tom up to ?
We &apos;re not exactly sure what it was .
What &apos;s that have to do with me ?
Is that the best you can do ?
You have a family to think of .
You had better go at once .
I think we should just be friends .
What &apos;ll Tom say ?
He was so tired that he could hardly stand .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say to Tom .
Tom and Mary have three children .
We &apos;ve lost them .
We &apos;re going back to Boston .
Have any of you read that book ?
I don &apos;t know the truth .
I want you to help Tom .
Where did you buy your car ?
I saw you with Tom .
Tom can &apos;t have gone to bed yet .
Is Tom still up ?
Tom asked for some money .
My dog didn &apos;t do that .
That &apos;s my dog .
They &apos;ve been at it for hours .
We &apos;re still here .
Tom didn &apos;t know how to help Mary .
They &apos;ve gone .
It would be better to try .
I &apos;ll ask him .
You swim very quickly .
I &apos;m going to read some other books .
I don &apos;t know your name .
We &apos;re not going to wait for Tom .
Have you seen enough ?
I don &apos;t go out much .
No one can understand your letter .
It is too good to be true .
I have to find it .
How long do we have ?
We &apos;re in Australia now .
Are you two busy right now ?
What would you like to do while you &apos;re here ?
Let Tom live .
Tom and Mary look very tired .
I told Tom .
I want this .
I plan to go to Boston next month .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
I don &apos;t think of it like that .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
What do you do with these ?
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
I still don &apos;t know yet .
Tom must be over thirty by now .
Tom said he &apos;d never leave his wife .
It should be fun doing that .
When do we go ?
Tom is difficult .
Tom and Mary are with me .
I don &apos;t get it .
How many times do I have to tell you this ?
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s doing OK .
We &apos;ve run out of tea .
What will we eat ?
Tom looks well .
What &apos;re they up to ?
I &apos;ll come home .
Tom is fast , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom &apos;s not sick .
I &apos;m alone with Tom .
Tom says he has to study French .
Tom has been living alone for a long time .
I don &apos;t want to be your wife .
I &apos;ll see you a week from today .
You should ask Tom first .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house for dinner .
Did you give it to Tom ?
I think you should eat something .
Why would I want to help Tom ?
Who is that boy ?
Can you please help me ?
Do what you like .
Can you tell me how to get to the station ?
There &apos;s no one there .
Tom didn &apos;t keep Mary waiting too long .
Tom wanted to get back to the office .
I don &apos;t ever want to see Tom again .
What do you have there ?
It &apos;s important to read books .
I went to the hospital to see my wife .
I have the money .
Tom tried .
Is it five already ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look old .
Tom has started studying French again .
I will make a man out of you .
Come with us .
I &apos;d like to know what it is .
I know Tom is tired .
Tom likes to talk about himself .
I don &apos;t like Tom and Mary .
I don &apos;t love her , not even if she loves me .
Tom is a good friend of yours , isn &apos;t he ?
They &apos;ll like it .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love it .
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him .
She asked me a question .
Tom took off his shoes .
You should do that soon .
Why can &apos;t I sing like they can ?
I &apos;m not a child .
He needs help .
No one knows .
I have nothing to say to you .
I love my life .
We &apos;ll do it this way from now on .
Tom won &apos;t be here until later .
Who found this ?
They are all very happy .
I won &apos;t forget you , Tom .
Did Tom come home ?
We &apos;re going to do it again .
Are you sure that you want to do this ?
I can see Tom .
Where do you have to be ?
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you .
It &apos;s good to see you , too .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
The weather is bad , isn &apos;t it ?
We know what Tom and Mary want .
We don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
Tom seems to be waiting for someone .
Let &apos;s talk about it after school .
Tom says he has a plan .
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon .
I want my life back .
Let &apos;s not play .
I &apos;ll get this .
I can understand French better than I can speak it .
I can &apos;t give it to Tom .
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
I don &apos;t really know Tom very well .
I want to go , too .
Tom can &apos;t find his watch .
I like your hat .
I don &apos;t know where Tom will do that .
This hat is too big for you .
I wrote the book .
This is my new car .
Just how long do you think it &apos;ll take to get there ?
Tom isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
What would you like to eat ?
Tom gave me a bicycle .
He doesn &apos;t know French at all .
I &apos;d like to have an answer .
Tom turned up three hours late .
Can &apos;t you help us ?
Tom is a good father .
The question is whether he &apos;ll read the letter or not .
He said that he was very happy .
What do you think about it ?
I don &apos;t like what &apos;s going on .
How do we get back home from here ?
I want to buy a new bicycle .
I want a friend .
It won &apos;t help you .
I think Tom should do it .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
It &apos;s the only thing we can do .
Tom is just like you .
This is the watch that I bought yesterday .
Tom never would &apos;ve said that .
I &apos;ll be done in an hour .
We have only two dollars .
He never speaks of the accident .
I want to sleep a little longer .
Tom thinks he knows what to do .
I &apos;ll come to your place .
I &apos;m taking off .
I need to talk to you .
You should meet Tom .
What are you doing ?
He did nothing wrong .
I don &apos;t want to visit Tom .
When &apos;s Tom going to get here ?
Boston is where I want to be .
I &apos;m busy , too .
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
He probably won &apos;t come .
Why can &apos;t I see you ?
I asked Tom how his job was going .
Tom really needs your help .
English is not easy for me .
I can &apos;t speak English at all .
I love my friends .
We &apos;re almost home .
You can &apos;t do this .
You &apos;ve never had a girlfriend , have you ?
I became angry .
Tom has come to Boston .
Is that important ?
Tom won &apos;t like you .
Tom gave me this .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t even know why I don &apos;t like him .
There &apos;s no need to go to school today .
Do you know Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
Don &apos;t say too much .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d seen John .
I want to become a doctor .
Tom is going to have to do it .
She did pretty well .
I don &apos;t know if we can help Tom this time .
Where were they born ?
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
She forgot to write him .
We don &apos;t have it .
I &apos;m a little tired .
Tom didn &apos;t come back .
This is a very good tea .
Do you want to do this now ?
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I found Tom .
Have you been in Boston long ?
What is it you want to do ?
I think that Tom likes Mary .
I was able to find the street , but I couldn &apos;t find her house .
I was surprised to see you here .
They lost everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;d do without Mary .
I know that Tom is in love with Mary .
It &apos;s still Monday .
Would you please show me how it &apos;s done ?
We all agree with you .
I &apos;ve got to find Tom .
Don &apos;t you want me to be happy ?
I don &apos;t want to go outside .
There is no one there .
We do what we have to .
I have no one to go to for advice .
I will not go to school tomorrow .
I &apos;m busy right now , Tom .
How can I help you ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good boy .
I will speak to you tomorrow .
I can &apos;t help it .
Mary really takes after her mother .
As soon as Tom finished work , he went home .
Tom says that he &apos;s just eaten .
Tom found nothing .
I thought you &apos;d want this one .
We have enough time to catch the train .
What are you trying to say ?
What did you expect ?
I &apos;ll be here .
What was Tom up to ?
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school .
I &apos;ve got friends in Boston .
What did Tom just tell you ?
Where do you think you are ?
Tom took off for home .
I just want you to know that I &apos;m here for you .
You don &apos;t have to do this .
We need to speak to Tom again .
Do you know when she will come ?
I wish today were Monday .
Tom got that bicycle from Mary .
I &apos;m not even sure I want to see that movie .
Why were you late ?
Tom is too busy to help .
She lives alone .
Tom can &apos;t read yet .
This is food .
I have seen her before .
I &apos;m going to Boston .
Where did you hear that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look too well .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with you ?
Do you have a lot of time ?
Did you let Tom drive your car ?
What &apos;s Tom up to in Boston ?
I did not read a book yesterday .
Tom heard Mary talking .
She can play tennis very well , but I can play just about as well as she can .
I still don &apos;t believe it !
It is said that he was very rich .
He said he would write to me , but he hasn &apos;t .
This car is good .
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out .
I don &apos;t want to play anymore .
We &apos;re not as young as Tom .
I want my money .
We &apos;ve already lost three days .
I &apos;m coming to Boston .
I don &apos;t know if you remember me .
How did you find Tom ?
Can I come over ?
Can they see me ?
I &apos;m on my own .
I talked with her for an hour .
We can do a lot better than this .
I think those are Tom &apos;s books .
Come on ! We &apos;re going to be late .
I &apos;m bad at tennis .
I understand you .
How long has it been since you heard from him ?
Tom seemed to enjoy it .
Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
I don &apos;t know whether he &apos;ll come by train or by car .
I know I have a lot to learn .
That &apos;s the only answer I can give .
What did his wife say ?
Tom did it right away .
Is French hard to learn ?
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us that he didn &apos;t know how to swim ?
I just couldn &apos;t sleep .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he comes home .
It makes me very happy .
Tom might come .
I can &apos;t give you that .
I can hardly believe it .
Tom said he just needed more time .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
You can &apos;t stay for long .
All my friends have children .
My father thinks that he &apos;s always right .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Tom &apos;s family is in Australia .
Tom didn &apos;t see a thing .
Tell Tom I &apos;m ready .
Tom needs to get ready for school .
Tom has many books .
He had fun with it .
How is the family ?
I never do that .
Maybe I went a little too far .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
That &apos;s what I want most .
Nobody needs me .
Give that to me , please .
I can go .
How do you do ?
Tom is living with his family .
Tom was happy .
How was your afternoon ?
Tom never had to study very much .
How is the weather today ?
We &apos;re young .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
I &apos;ll be your teacher .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she had to get back to work .
We &apos;ll help .
I don &apos;t want that .
Tom is probably alone in his room .
I only hope that that &apos;s enough .
I won &apos;t ask you anything else today .
I &apos;ll be OK .
I don &apos;t know if I still have it .
Tom thought about Mary a lot .
You can &apos;t bring your cat to school .
I think that boy &apos;s name is Tom .
Tom is at school right now .
Do you have enough time ?
Tom is going to Boston with me .
I &apos;ve only been there once .
Tom wanted to know how Mary had become so rich .
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself .
My family &apos;s not rich .
You can &apos;t please everyone .
I &apos;ve never heard you talk like that .
I have a lot of books .
I want to know why you did that .
Do you want one of them ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t eat .
Do you like to live in the country ?
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
You seem very busy .
Tom gave me a book .
Tom had an accident at work .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the doctor .
Tom lives with his mother .
They can &apos;t see Tom .
I can &apos;t go back to that house .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
He &apos;s afraid that he might be late .
Tom knows we know it .
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
What did Tom find ?
I could swim well even when I was a child .
Tom &apos;s home .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything .
I know Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
I have to go to school .
Tom has three children .
Do you want to know why ?
Tom wants to be with Mary .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
She didn &apos;t give me my money back .
I love you .
Tom was there for three hours .
Tom won &apos;t believe I did that .
What time is it now ?
I &apos;m going to come .
You look just like my sister .
What do you want me to ask Tom ?
You don &apos;t want to do this .
I can &apos;t believe Tom bought that house .
Tom and Mary are sick .
Tom spent a lot of time with Mary .
What time does the next train leave ?
He has made me what I am .
I &apos;ve lost my friends .
I want to make you happy .
Did Tom really do that ?
I finished work at six .
No one wants to go there .
I don &apos;t know who that man is .
Why do you think Tom is here ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Could we please go home now ?
We shouldn &apos;t have left Tom alone .
I want to talk to the doctor .
You &apos;re my friends .
What &apos;s the matter ?
We need them .
I &apos;m happy for you .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
I did not think that he would help us .
My father has just come home .
Tom needs help now .
Can you do this without any help ?
This is better than nothing .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother ?
No one says that .
Does Tom have a big family ?
No one had any questions about the plan .
I &apos;ll need some help .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come or not .
We &apos;re just friends .
Maybe we should wait until Tom gets here .
Who &apos;s going to do this ?
I &apos;m not sure .
I want that more than anything .
He came home very late .
Don &apos;t give me that !
There was food enough for us all .
I have to study French .
What are you doing here in Boston ?
Is there anything else to eat ?
You know that I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come see me .
We &apos;re out of beer .
I &apos;ll find someone .
When is school out ?
Who found you ?
Please let me go .
I gave him what money I had .
Tom has a lot of things to do .
I still have time .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
I &apos;m very sorry for being late .
Why is that ?
What &apos;s your sister &apos;s name ?
What have you been doing all this time !
Tom found a job .
Did you get their letter ?
Tom isn &apos;t as young as most people think he is .
I &apos;m not sure why I &apos;m here .
I love her sister very much .
I wish Tom were more like you .
How do you think it &apos;ll go ?
This makes me think of you .
What do you think of my new hat ?
Tom loves Mary and she loves him .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s father .
I don &apos;t think he knows I love you .
Tom looks really good .
Tom can &apos;t swim at all .
This is my office .
This seems too good to be true .
I want your opinion .
We &apos;re back from Australia .
The coffee &apos;s ready .
I have one question .
I &apos;m not busy .
No one knows whether he loves her or not .
Tom had nothing left to eat .
There is nothing that can &apos;t be bought with money .
I think you &apos;re ready .
That &apos;s all I have to say .
She said that she was happy .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom .
I do not like both of them .
This isn &apos;t for me .
What do you see here ?
I &apos;ve already told Tom what needs to be done .
Come quickly !
I want something to drink .
I know you have it with you .
I haven &apos;t got it yet .
How &apos;s your French ?
Tom is still in Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I &apos;ll know tomorrow .
Tom died before Mary was born .
Tom can &apos;t wait any longer .
Tom had a plan .
Who &apos;s not busy ?
He gave up his life for his country .
Do you want to go ?
That is your book .
What &apos;s wrong , Tom ?
There is no school today .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
She is eating .
Tom was hard to please .
Tom loves Mary more than I do .
Where did you get this ?
Tom seemed to know what he was doing .
I think he &apos;s right .
Is there anyone here ?
Tom thought it was a good idea .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
I thought you , of all people , would understand .
We haven &apos;t got much time .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see this .
You may take the book .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that Mary is happy .
Don &apos;t leave them alone .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything else ?
This was my plan all along .
Have you heard this story already ?
Tom doesn &apos;t always come late .
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question .
I need to go to the hospital .
Tom likes what he does .
I think that Tom is thirty years old .
Mary is Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
I do not like music .
I think I know what Tom is doing here .
Give me another reason .
We &apos;ll sing .
Tom doesn &apos;t do anything .
Tom said he &apos;d be back soon .
What did you make ?
I did it and I would do it again .
I think Tom likes Mary .
Tom got sick .
Tom bought a new car yesterday .
I knew Tom would like it here .
I think Tom is here .
Tom and I are both a little busy right now .
That can &apos;t be .
This is the man I told you about .
I love doing this .
I did what Tom wanted me to do .
Tom and Mary were very happy together .
Tom has finished .
Why do you learn English ?
Tom came to Boston to visit Mary .
That was hard to believe .
I &apos;m not even sure whether Tom will come or not .
I &apos;m surprised .
I asked Tom where Mary was .
She should not have done such a thing .
I heard that Tom did that .
Tom just turned thirty years old .
Maybe I just need some time alone .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat .
I got angry .
Mary is young and beautiful .
I don &apos;t remember any of it .
That &apos;s what we think .
No one was late .
You &apos;re not one of us .
I can &apos;t go alone .
I think that it was his mistake .
What do you think ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to tell Mary , but he did .
Tom thought no one was at home .
How are you , Tom ?
Are you sure you want to do it ?
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s house .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
I &apos;ll be at home tomorrow .
Tom is very good to Mary .
He &apos;s your friend .
How are you ?
I like to be here .
I want to know what to expect .
Tell me what to do .
I &apos;ll write to Tom again .
Are you Tom &apos;s mother ?
I haven &apos;t even told Tom .
I wish I had enough money to buy a new bicycle .
I know where you are .
That is my dog .
What do you think of me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like it .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me what to do ?
Did Tom see this ?
That is really good news .
Can you please stop that ?
I just need to talk to you .
You &apos;re not as young as Tom .
Tom and I did that .
I want you to take me to Tom .
You &apos;ve done it !
I still don &apos;t know why you asked me to be here today .
I don &apos;t think they like me .
I can &apos;t let you give me your last ten dollars .
Who likes Tom ?
I know that this is important .
We can &apos;t do this anymore .
Tom has more books than I do .
You aren &apos;t rich , are you ?
Come back home .
Tom wanted to say more .
Tom can talk .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
Tom saw us .
It &apos;s not a big thing .
We can help Tom .
I get on well with him .
I should &apos;ve done that .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
When does Tom want to do that ?
I &apos;ve found the answer .
You &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
I can &apos;t eat .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
There &apos;s no coffee .
I just can &apos;t help .
I lost a lot of money .
I &apos;d like to go with Tom .
I don &apos;t know whether to go or to stay .
I don &apos;t have a problem .
I would like to speak with Tom .
It is fun to speak in English .
What does your father do ?
I &apos;m done with you .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
I &apos;m not sure yet , but I think I &apos;ll become a teacher .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
I wonder why Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
What time do you want me to be here ?
It won &apos;t take me a long time .
Tom says he was busy .
I have to be home for dinner .
It &apos;d be better if you didn &apos;t come today .
I want to give this to Tom .
He was at home .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
Give it back .
Did Tom tell you who his wife is ?
I do hope that he will get well soon .
Tom will probably be here all afternoon .
What &apos;ll Tom be doing in Boston ?
Why aren &apos;t you here , Tom ?
Tom may have been there . I don &apos;t know .
I thought that you had already eaten .
Can it be true ?
Tom won &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
He &apos;s rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
I want you to go to Boston with Tom .
Why are you going there ?
Everyone wants something .
Can I come ?
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him .
I believe Tom can do that .
Tom has a lot of friends now .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
I wonder what became of Tom .
Tom looked very tired when I saw him yesterday .
It won &apos;t be that easy .
How are things ?
This morning it was very cold .
Can I have some more tea ?
Tom already knows the truth .
I have to go to work .
What makes you so sure Tom wants to stay ?
I thought Tom was at school .
Tom is old enough to go to school .
Tom is doing quite well in school .
Please don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
In Japan , all children go to school .
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;d love to , but I can &apos;t .
Do you know how busy I &apos;ve been ?
A man came to see him .
I &apos;m sorry for that .
I quickly tried to get advice from him .
I &apos;m thinking about it .
Who &apos;s having a problem here , you or Tom ?
Why do you think Tom would do that ?
We saw you .
We know who they are .
I &apos;ve just talked to Tom .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
He is often late for school .
I can wait for you .
I &apos;ll write you a letter .
That makes me very happy .
Tom only does what he has to do .
I don &apos;t like him .
She takes a walk with her dog .
You really should talk to Tom .
He &apos;s not very good at it .
I don &apos;t know how they do it .
No one knows his name .
We &apos;re not young anymore .
I don &apos;t think Tom has met Mary yet .
Tom was afraid to swim .
I &apos;m thinking of going .
You need help .
Is Tom big ?
How many people did you see in the park ?
Let &apos;s buy this one .
Can I say something ?
I &apos;m going to sleep on it .
Why does Tom want to go there ?
You &apos;ve lost everything .
I &apos;m getting to it .
I &apos;m better than Tom .
Tom had work to do .
Let &apos;s talk .
I will never see him again .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Let &apos;s play something .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
I think Tom will like this .
Tom has friends all over the world .
I think it would be fun .
Tom , how &apos;s it going ?
What did Tom do ?
Who &apos;s sick ?
I don &apos;t know any more than you do .
I believe Tom is right .
Tom was surprised .
Tell me everything you know about Tom .
You &apos;ve tried .
I love you very much .
I did that already .
I haven &apos;t eaten yet .
I &apos;m going out with Mary .
The mother didn &apos;t know what to do with her son .
Tom wants to know your name .
No one likes it .
It &apos;ll be over in a moment .
He has money .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
They don &apos;t want Tom there .
I never did that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to do .
What are you doing right now ?
Tom got a letter from Mary today .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
What would you have done in Tom &apos;s place ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom saw .
Tom is only five , but he already knows how to read .
Tom told me that he doesn &apos;t have a problem with that .
You didn &apos;t come to school yesterday , did you ?
I have a little money now .
His house is by a river .
Everyone knows .
Tom is kind of tired . He wants to go home .
I have known that for a long time .
He was alone .
Give me a drink .
Tom and Mary want to go home .
I thought you &apos;d like it .
Tom seems to be very sick .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his brother .
I &apos;m on my way .
Do you want to work here ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
Tom knows Mary and John are no longer together .
I look like Tom .
He thought the matter over for three days .
My family lives in Boston .
How long is he going to stay in Japan ?
My door was closed .
This is all the money I have .
We have to leave now .
Do you know why she &apos;s so angry ?
I told Tom that I wasn &apos;t busy .
I should &apos;ve gone home .
What did you find ?
I thought he was my brother .
We found something .
What makes you think I want this ?
I &apos;d like to come home now .
Which do you like better , tea or coffee ?
I don &apos;t want to come back here ever again .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be able to work tomorrow .
Tom came .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t like children .
No one knows what happened .
This isn &apos;t just for me .
I can &apos;t forget her .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
How far do we have to go ?
I &apos;m the last one who saw Tom .
If you don &apos;t want to do it for Tom , then do it for me .
Who else is going with us ?
Tom and Mary are waiting with John .
I bought many books .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
Let me go !
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
We know what we want .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
It &apos;s time to go .
I &apos;m here for you , Tom .
That &apos;s not for Tom .
I do think it &apos;s possible .
He lives all by himself in the country .
I didn &apos;t read the story .
I wanted to talk with you .
You don &apos;t have to tell that to your parents .
It was already too late .
I &apos;m not busy now .
You have to find Tom .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer his question .
Tom has a bicycle .
We don &apos;t need you .
When you &apos;ve finished reading that book , I &apos;d like to read it .
You look like your father .
Give it up , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to remember Mary .
I &apos;ll see you when you get here .
I have something to ask Tom .
That &apos;s exactly what I mean .
Do you know where ?
Do you have enough time to do that ?
He has more books than he can read .
I thought I was too old .
We need to know what happened .
Can you swim at all ?
I have no money with me .
Tom did that really well .
How long do we have to wait here ?
Have you seen my wife ?
When do you plan to go ?
I want you to come with me .
Tom seems to be tired .
We &apos;ll be home all day tomorrow .
Tom knows what we &apos;re doing .
If Tom doesn &apos;t eat this , please give it to Mary .
I &apos;ll be back .
Tom has a job .
Is Tom your brother ?
I wish I were young again .
I was born in this hospital .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
Tom will find something .
Please come home as quickly as possible .
Tom arrived too early .
Tom and I are good friends .
Tom and Mary gave me that .
I &apos;m really sorry about Tom .
It &apos;s too late now .
What were you doing out here ?
I believe Tom .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d enjoy doing that .
It &apos;s too fast .
Is this baby a boy or a girl ?
I &apos;d like that .
Don &apos;t you give up on me .
Tom looks very young .
I &apos;m just looking .
She made tea for me .
You shouldn &apos;t wait any longer .
I don &apos;t believe you can do it .
Tom has told us a lot about you .
It &apos;s every man for himself .
I just wanted to be sure .
Can you come back later ?
We have everything we need now .
Are you sure he can do this ?
Tom is very busy now .
He &apos;ll be back home soon .
I can &apos;t remember his name .
He has many friends .
I didn &apos;t really want to do that .
I need to work .
Tom would do that .
I &apos;ve found it .
Tom knows the man Mary came with .
He came to see you yesterday .
Tom is going out again .
I &apos;m not a bit tired .
Tom does that , too .
There are many books in my room .
Tom is out of the office .
They found it .
Tom knows we aren &apos;t happy .
Her friends look up to her .
Tom is busy right now .
My mother must be angry .
That &apos;s a book .
Let &apos;s go to eat together .
I don &apos;t remember him saying that .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
I didn &apos;t want to do it again .
Tom is probably rich .
We &apos;ll go see Tom .
We don &apos;t want to do this .
Tom is going to want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to make of this .
Tom will understand .
What do you want to say ?
That &apos;ll do it .
I agree with both of you .
Tom likes money .
We know you &apos;re there .
I &apos;m a man .
Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to .
Tom is at home now .
Tom didn &apos;t go home .
Have you read this ?
I have to stay home .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
I don &apos;t see a problem with this .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been there .
Tom had other things he wanted to buy .
Don &apos;t say that .
He does not like us .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
I can &apos;t say I &apos;m surprised .
Did Tom leave ?
I don &apos;t want to do that , but I have to .
I think there &apos;s someone out there .
Maybe I don &apos;t love you .
I &apos;m not really sure why .
I am busy .
I was surprised .
I didn &apos;t expect that question .
We are his children .
Tom has one brother .
I need you .
This isn &apos;t my car .
I think you &apos;ve been here too long .
I wonder if you might be able to help me .
You should &apos;ve seen that movie last night .
The dog is in the house .
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary .
I &apos;m not here every day .
Tom lives in the city .
Tom is coming to Boston with us .
It &apos;s only Monday .
What if he doesn &apos;t want to talk to me ?
The man is right .
I &apos;m too busy to help you right now .
Don &apos;t worry about it !
You know what you must do .
They didn &apos;t do anything .
She gave him some money .
Tom hasn &apos;t been back here for years .
Tom does not look happy .
The old man died last week .
I want to go to Australia .
I had nothing to do with it .
Nobody likes Tom .
Is Tom still here ?
It &apos;s always like that .
I &apos;m very worried about Tom .
I have to do that .
Let &apos;s have some fun .
I &apos;m not sorry that I did this .
Tom &apos;ll know .
This is good for me .
Tom made me angry .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
This house is very big , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom is already here .
Tom gets up early .
We always want what we don &apos;t have .
Tom knew that he &apos;d have to tell Mary the truth .
We can &apos;t do that .
May I ask you a question ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about Mary .
I wonder why you would say something like that to me .
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t here .
I love tea .
I wonder why .
Why are we still here ?
Tom can help .
Don &apos;t you want to do this ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a brother .
He &apos;s getting up early .
I don &apos;t know whether I will have time to do it .
Where do I come in ?
I couldn &apos;t speak .
When does the next train leave ?
You have to study more .
Tom knows why Mary is here .
That cake looks good .
I can &apos;t say that .
Tom seemed afraid .
Tom is the kind of man I like .
Tom knew exactly where Mary was .
I wonder if he loves me .
I said I &apos;ll get it .
I &apos;m doing it for Tom .
We do need your advice .
I think we both know why I &apos;m here .
Tom looked at his dog and his dog looked at him .
What &apos;s Tom doing out there ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom wouldn &apos;t be afraid .
What do you think I should &apos;ve said ?
He doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
I didn &apos;t read the book .
He asked a very good question .
Have you read all of these books ?
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
That &apos;s for you .
I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
Tom thinks he knows the answer .
Tom likes Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom died three hours after Mary died .
They won &apos;t hurt you .
I haven &apos;t read all of these books .
&quot; Who is it ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s your mother . &quot;
Tom doesn &apos;t know that yet .
Where do you want to go ?
That boy won &apos;t tell me his name .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
We still need more time .
Tom won &apos;t like it in Australia .
Tom came to me for help .
He is as busy as ever .
Tom &apos;s young .
Tom is still too young to drink beer .
When do you need it by ?
Let me know when you &apos;ll be ready .
I think Tom knows what to do .
I don &apos;t know anything about Japan .
Tom and Mary are in the car waiting for us .
They don &apos;t want us to know .
You need it .
Tom is outside .
They say he is very rich .
It &apos;s not like it used to be .
Tom knows who Mary is .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants .
I don &apos;t like this hat .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
I thought you would come .
I &apos;m finished .
You are really very good .
I love everything about you .
That &apos;s our problem .
All we can do is wait .
It doesn &apos;t matter what she said .
You &apos;re back again .
I understand why .
We &apos;re back .
Tom and I were very busy last week .
We can &apos;t leave Tom .
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
I knew you &apos;d be here .
Please tell me what I &apos;m doing wrong .
Tom is going to tell Mary he &apos;s sorry .
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon .
Tom died young .
You don &apos;t need to study today .
This is easy .
This is where I was born .
I hope you feel better tomorrow .
Give me just a little .
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
You &apos;ll be with me .
Tom didn &apos;t really enjoy studying French .
I told him everything .
I &apos;ve never been this happy before .
I come here every Monday .
Tom is very important .
Tom and Mary are still together .
I could do it again .
We can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about Mary .
Tom is still looking out the window .
Tom already knows my opinion .
Is there any beer left ?
It &apos;s no trouble at all .
Why do you put up with that ?
You know where everything is .
You &apos;ve got to go home .
Tom asked too many questions .
There &apos;s something I want you to see .
It was too easy .
Tom had many friends .
Tom said he would try .
Why don &apos;t people like me ?
I wasn &apos;t at home then .
This is how it happened .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
All of my children want to go to Australia .
I &apos;ve been here almost three years now .
Tom can speak French , too .
How long has Tom been working here ?
Tom is our friend .
You can ask me anything you like .
Tom can &apos;t wait until next week .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
That &apos;s what we want .
I don &apos;t know them at all .
It &apos;s what Tom had .
We don &apos;t know why he had to leave .
We &apos;ll help you .
Is Tom there , too ?
Tom still hasn &apos;t eaten dinner .
He looked very tired .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
I don &apos;t even have time to read .
Tom told me that he &apos;s cold .
He looks a bit tired .
No one came with me .
I asked Tom where he had gone to school .
Do you know what has become of him ?
How do you say that in French ?
Tom knows how to do that .
He has this large room to himself .
I don &apos;t know where you live .
I know the girl .
I &apos;m going to be late .
I am not busy now .
Tom has nothing to do .
Tell me where Tom lives .
I will give it to you .
There is a woman who wants to see you .
Don &apos;t do it again .
I think Tom is too old for Mary .
Tom went out of the room .
He was alone in the house .
Why are we studying French ?
I can &apos;t stay .
You can stay with us .
I wish I could speak French as well as you do .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that the way he should be .
We have a lot to do .
Where &apos;s your hat ?
I &apos;ve seen that .
The weather is beautiful .
Don &apos;t say things like that .
I &apos;ll come as often as possible .
Tom and Mary have found something .
I just love that .
Tom will have an answer for you by next week .
He has much more money than I have .
Where did you learn to drive ?
Tom isn &apos;t here .
I know your father .
They &apos;ll like that .
Did you read them ?
I thought we did a good job .
I &apos;ll make you a drink .
Let &apos;s go back to Australia .
I could hardly hear him .
We &apos;re at home today .
I &apos;ll write to you as soon as possible .
Tom might be sick .
I don &apos;t have the time to read this book .
How old are you now ?
Tom still lives with his parents .
Tom is sick .
I don &apos;t like your girlfriend .
Is it money you want ?
Tom didn &apos;t make it very far .
Did you see her there ?
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be .
We &apos;ll have to do this later .
Where is the money , Tom ?
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
He never said it again .
We didn &apos;t talk long .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether he can do it , but he &apos;ll give it a try .
Can we help you ?
Do you have a bicycle ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good father .
I don &apos;t know what I did wrong .
Tom didn &apos;t have time .
He gave me this book .
I &apos;m here , too .
I wonder if this is wrong .
I mean it !
Tell me how that &apos;s possible .
Tom is still on the job .
Tom was right at home .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Do you want to go to Boston with me ?
We can &apos;t live like this .
Tom did that for Mary .
We can &apos;t see it .
Where are our friends ?
I had a lot of fun at the party .
Where have you been all this time ?
No one loves you like I do .
Is there anything more I can do ?
Please do not try this at home .
Tom is here in Boston with me .
What time do you expect me to be there ?
How far along are you ?
I know your name .
This is what I have to do .
Your French is very good .
The boy I love doesn &apos;t love me .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything today .
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said .
Tom comes to Boston once a year .
We &apos;re sorry , but we can &apos;t do anything more for you .
I forget his name .
Tom is so happy .
My father is a teacher .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
I was quite surprised .
I hope it &apos;s not true .
May I have a word with you ?
Tom won &apos;t be able to go with us .
Tom might think that we want him to do that .
I feel cold this morning .
I knew you would understand .
They &apos;ll understand that .
I should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
You must help us .
Tom couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
It was a long time since I &apos;ve done that .
What did you do this week ?
I don &apos;t mind doing it .
Why don &apos;t you want to do this ?
There &apos;s something I forgot to tell you .
I do not want to work .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
Do you want to see it ?
Tom saw her .
How long has Tom been living in Boston ?
Tom might know something .
I will help you if possible .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom .
I want to study English .
Tom will come for sure .
Can you come to the office by train ?
What is he like ?
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
Tell Tom when you &apos;ll be back .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he has to do .
Let &apos;s play this game again .
Tom is not coming .
I should &apos;ve known you &apos;d come back .
We all make mistakes , don &apos;t we ?
I want to stay .
I don &apos;t know who you are .
It &apos;s one of the things that I like about you .
Tom asked Mary when the last time she had bought a book was .
Tom had a good opinion of Mary .
Tom may not do that .
Why is that good ?
He wouldn &apos;t believe us .
That &apos;s how we do it .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
We will visit them soon .
I &apos;m kind of happy .
There was no need for you to do that .
I wish Tom was here with us today .
Tom wants to live .
I had to go there alone .
They &apos;ll be afraid .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will come .
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Give them to me .
I don &apos;t think Tom will hurt Mary .
Get out of the water .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
I could swim well when I was a boy .
The whole country is talking about it .
Tom left Australia three years ago .
I can &apos;t live without Tom .
It &apos;s time to leave .
It didn &apos;t end well .
Is your mother here ?
Do you want anything to eat ?
I want money .
I would like to have some more water .
It &apos;s not as bad as it seems .
Tom can &apos;t do everything himself .
I &apos;d like a beer .
I want some cake .
They &apos;re very busy .
Did you tell Tom about Mary ?
I knew it was wrong .
What has Tom done now ?
What does this have to do with us ?
You know what you said .
I won &apos;t do that again .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to see what he &apos;s doing .
I think I &apos;ll be fine .
I &apos;ll come with you .
We know Tom didn &apos;t do it .
Tom told Mary what John wanted .
Is there anything else I should know about Tom ?
We don &apos;t want to do that here .
These are good .
Tom is looking at it .
We &apos;ve already eaten .
Tom speaks no French .
We need to leave .
You should never ask a woman how old she is .
Have you found an answer to this question ?
We saw Tom .
They don &apos;t listen .
Mary is a girl .
Tom may leave .
Tom tried to sleep , but couldn &apos;t .
Nobody could believe it .
This is Tom &apos;s room .
I found this watch at the station .
Where did you eat ?
Tom is better at this than I am .
Tom isn &apos;t sick .
I don &apos;t like doing this .
Tom can sing very well .
We &apos;ve already met .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
She won &apos;t like this .
They just left .
I can only tell you what I know .
What &apos;s that thing you have in your hand ?
You have to speak French here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
You can speak French , can &apos;t you ?
You could do better .
It isn &apos;t what I thought .
Tom can speak French as well .
We have to find Tom .
Tom found me a job .
How does Tom go to school ?
I wonder where she lives .
I am very sorry .
Tom really should speak French .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s father .
This is exactly what we want .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here in a long time .
The office seems very busy today .
I &apos;m alone now .
It &apos;s almost over .
I don &apos;t think anyone can help me anymore .
Tom would be able to do that .
How much money do you have with you ?
How come I haven &apos;t seen you here before ?
He doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
I &apos;m not in Boston .
Tom and Mary both should know better .
I can &apos;t speak to Tom .
They were never alone .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have married Mary .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
There was a lot of food in the house .
Tom is coming with us .
It was really good .
The problem here isn &apos;t me .
How long do you want to stay in Boston ?
Where are we eating tonight ?
I &apos;m not so good at tennis .
What are you doing next Monday ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have time .
Are you sure this is what Tom wanted us to buy ?
Tom found it .
Tom hasn &apos;t been home yet .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
I don &apos;t know where Tom lives .
Tom and Mary are both my friends .
I wasn &apos;t sure what to say .
Tom wants to go back to Boston .
I met Mary yesterday .
Tom already knows .
This doesn &apos;t happen every day .
Give me five days .
How long will you stay in Japan ?
You &apos;re not my friend anymore .
Tom has all day to get that done .
That &apos;s what works .
I like Tom a lot , you know .
This has to stop .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
Which one is mine ?
That &apos;s not how it is .
I wonder if Tom still likes Mary .
I have a big family .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
Who are you and why are you here ?
We have a lot of time .
I need to sleep now .
Do you want to see her very much ?
I don &apos;t look like that .
What does Tom see in you ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom didn &apos;t know how to swim .
This has happened before .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I really wish there was something I could do .
Tom took Mary with him .
I know all I need to know .
I would like to see that .
That won &apos;t happen .
Give them to him .
Tom speaks French better than I do .
It &apos;s what I want .
I need a lot of them .
This is good news .
You know I can &apos;t wait any longer .
I am busy now and can &apos;t play with you .
I really wish to see you today .
He can drive a car .
I thought so .
I just don &apos;t get it .
We &apos;re back early .
When did you first meet him ?
We can &apos;t just let Tom leave .
I &apos;m going to speak to Tom .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I told her what to do .
I &apos;m afraid of Tom .
Tom and Mary want a big family .
We know you have it .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
I want to be young again .
I &apos;ve been seen .
I think you &apos;re both right .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
Why did Tom want to learn French ?
Tom wasn &apos;t very good .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
Tom goes to bed early .
Get it ready at once .
Tom couldn &apos;t forget Mary even if he wanted to .
Tom looked fine .
I &apos;m not quite sure .
When does Tom walk his dog ?
They are talking about what they will sing .
That is how it happened .
Let &apos;s do that again .
Tom had nothing to do with that .
Do you want to be my friend ?
I have a brother .
I spent all day thinking about Tom .
It &apos;s been over a week since I last saw Tom .
She will be coming to see us again soon .
I want Tom to do it .
This is just too much .
My sister doesn &apos;t have a car .
It could &apos;ve been better .
Tom has thought of everything .
Tom is sure to come .
Maybe he will be a good teacher .
I think we have enough money .
There &apos;s something I have to tell you .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
I like this tea .
I &apos;m not sure I want Tom working for us .
I know who likes Tom .
What does that have to do with me ?
I know who it was .
This should be more than enough .
She says that she is happy .
I &apos;ve never done it before .
He knows hardly anything about it .
I may have to study French .
Tom doesn &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
What does he say in his letter ?
Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
I already tried that .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Tom has left town .
He needs money .
We all want you to be happy .
What is it you &apos;re doing ?
We &apos;ve got a lot to do .
Mary is like a sister to me .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
I don &apos;t think Tom saw us .
Tom likes Mary .
I want to know what you &apos;ll do .
Tom has gone to bed .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how much Mary loves him .
They &apos;re going .
I don &apos;t know what I believe .
I don &apos;t need to do that as often as I used to .
You know enough .
I wish I had a car .
Are you alone ?
Tom is taking too long .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Can you tell me what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
I wish Tom was here with me today .
Thank you for everything you have done for me .
I don &apos;t have a car , but my sister does .
We need to help Tom .
Tom loves Mary , but she doesn &apos;t love him .
I &apos;m taking off now .
He &apos;s not ready .
They &apos;re at home .
I don &apos;t remember where I bought it .
You should tell your mother as soon as possible .
I wanted more .
I have no home .
I &apos;d never say that .
What do you want me to do with these ?
I think you worry too much .
This will be difficult to do .
Tom isn &apos;t as old as I am .
What do they do ?
Thank you for doing that .
Take your time with it .
I have to do it myself .
He &apos;s going to love this .
Tom should leave now .
Why do we have to do that ?
What do you do after school ?
I didn &apos;t need to do that .
I &apos;ll be good to you .
He &apos;s really good looking .
Your shoes are here . Where are mine ?
I want to talk to you about Tom .
I &apos;m old , but I &apos;m not that old .
Do you still have it ?
I thought you &apos;d already talked to Tom .
He asked me what I needed .
Is your school far from here ?
That &apos;s what I told him .
Do you want some more tea ?
It can &apos;t be Tom .
I have a dog and a cat .
This is your dog .
We &apos;ve got to do something .
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
Tom has a picture he wants to show us .
I &apos;m sorry about what I said .
All you have to do is ask .
It just doesn &apos;t matter .
I told you Tom would help us out .
I wrote to Tom .
Would you like to go with me ?
Tom is playing with his son .
Tom doesn &apos;t think so .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me anything about it ?
I don &apos;t have to be here . I &apos;m here because I want to be .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I don &apos;t know what they are doing .
Give me the money .
What is it ?
We &apos;re doing it together .
We &apos;ll go a week from today .
Tom was busy , so he couldn &apos;t help us .
I &apos;m busy right now .
Is Tom over there with you ?
Why can Tom speak French so well ?
He went by bicycle .
We &apos;re not finished .
What &apos;s your opinion about that ?
I was the only man there .
This is how you do it .
I don &apos;t really understand what you want to say .
What does Tom want ?
I was at the hospital with Tom when he died .
Tom is always like that .
Is there anyone who can answer ?
Tom is not happy to be here .
How &apos;s your brother ?
Tom says he &apos;s very rich .
Tom sat in front of me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to buy anything else .
She might come tomorrow .
I really can &apos;t understand it .
Tom will go .
I &apos;m very afraid .
Give me some water , please .
You &apos;ll be fine .
I gave it to Tom .
Tom kept going .
I think you &apos;ll really enjoy reading this book .
I saw her only a week ago .
Tom knows where it is .
I know what I &apos;d say .
I have to say this .
I want to go there by myself .
Who &apos;s watching ?
Is Tom out ?
Why don &apos;t you go with Tom ?
Why would someone do that ?
Where are my parents ?
Why are you so tired today ?
Tom became tired .
Tom might talk .
I know how to do this .
Are you with me ?
Tom is here with me .
Are you for or against my plan ?
She works all night .
Why do we have to do it ?
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
I would like to talk with you again .
I don &apos;t like that anymore .
I want some food .
I don &apos;t understand why you want to do that .
I &apos;m in the park .
Tom has been sick for a very long time .
As far as I know , they are still together .
This isn &apos;t fun .
I might ask Tom what happened .
That &apos;s how it should be .
He was busy , but he took the time to show me around the city .
Tom wants to work .
What can I do for you ?
I hope that &apos;s not true .
Tom looked around the room .
We shouldn &apos;t swim here .
Tom lives in a big house .
Tom may not be able to come .
What happened there ?
My parents don &apos;t like Tom .
I would ask him if I were you .
I don &apos;t like what he said .
Are you really a doctor ?
Is this your phone ?
Do you want Tom to go to Boston ?
I know something about it .
Give it to him .
Tom needs more .
Do you want this or not ?
Who was the woman you were talking to ?
What they did made Tom happy .
How are you these days ?
I saw her last week .
I want you to have it .
I know what to do .
You &apos;d better go . It &apos;s getting late .
You have a problem .
We sure don &apos;t want that .
He went to bed .
I think I love you .
Tom thinks Mary knows .
It &apos;s my mistake , not yours .
Did you tell Tom ?
Everyone &apos;s going .
I will help you all I can .
Did you go to school yesterday ?
Don &apos;t you want to be rich ?
She &apos;s not a child .
I &apos;m going to tell Tom the truth .
I thought you &apos;d ask that .
I &apos;m happy .
Tom will be here for three days .
We haven &apos;t got all day .
He doesn &apos;t live far away .
I hope that I can do it .
I wish I could understand you better .
We &apos;re here for the day .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he wants .
I &apos;d like to go home .
Why don &apos;t you just forget it ?
I &apos;ve got a few questions .
What kind of person does something like that ?
You didn &apos;t tell Tom anything , did you ?
What books have you read in English ?
We have a lot of things that need to be done .
Would you like to see my new car ?
She is young .
Tom made only three mistakes .
Japan is not what it was ten years ago .
That &apos;s life .
Tom and I will meet you there .
Don &apos;t keep company with him .
I didn &apos;t hear you coming .
Tom said he &apos;d wait .
Let the children play .
I &apos;d love to have one of those .
We &apos;re not finished yet .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home now .
Tom is afraid of his father .
Are you really sick ?
That won &apos;t work .
He is no longer here .
You &apos;ll have to work a lot .
We can talk .
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
What do you think I did ?
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
You gave me your word .
It may well be true .
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary .
I know I love you .
Tom has bought a house in Boston .
You &apos;re going to wait , right ?
What time does the bus leave ?
I have no idea what to expect .
Get Tom some food .
He asked his friend for advice .
You did not come to school yesterday .
I will tell the woman what I know .
I asked Tom to speak French .
Tom isn &apos;t here , is he ?
I can &apos;t do it by myself .
Why do you want to buy this book ?
Tom wanted to buy that book and give it to Mary .
You don &apos;t know where he is .
Let &apos;s wait here .
Why don &apos;t you come over after work today ?
Tom can &apos;t help us anymore .
That &apos;s what we saw .
I can &apos;t believe you came here alone .
Tom wants a new bicycle .
Why are you home ?
How long does it take to get from here to the station ?
Tom won &apos;t talk .
I think you &apos;d better go and visit him .
He has too many books .
I wish I were young .
He made his parents happy .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
Tom isn &apos;t always late .
Are you at home ?
This was a lot of fun .
She &apos;s happy .
Tom said he &apos;d help Mary .
How much time do we have ?
I lost .
What do you know about this ?
I &apos;m going to need more help .
That can &apos;t be the good news .
What is it that you want ?
I have to stop this .
Tom left Mary behind .
It &apos;s always been like that .
Where are you on Monday ?
You will stay at home .
When will he come ?
I come to Boston quite a lot .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t always right .
She can swim .
I have another question .
I may do that .
Let &apos;s go back to the office .
I thought that Tom had done that for us .
He can swim very fast .
It &apos;ll take you too long .
Did you buy a new car ?
You &apos;re not happy , are you ?
Have Tom do that .
I go to school every morning .
Give me your book .
It &apos;s not like you think .
I don &apos;t want to do that with Tom .
He will be talking with his family at this time tomorrow .
I could hardly understand him .
I can &apos;t remember her name .
I &apos;m sure Tom can &apos;t swim .
The old man lives by himself .
I got it .
Is he a teacher ?
Have you met him already ?
They know who he is .
This door won &apos;t open .
Please tell me what &apos;s wrong , Tom .
I &apos;ll meet with Tom .
I know what it &apos;s like to be alone .
Tom says he &apos;ll give it a try .
Tom isn &apos;t looking at Mary .
I got up at six .
I don &apos;t see anything .
Where do we have to do that ?
You have no idea , do you ?
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
I want another beer .
I have nothing to say on this matter .
Tom does it all the time .
We &apos;ve talked about it .
Tom seemed surprised .
I thought Tom would meet Mary .
Tom made this for Mary .
Can we swim here ?
I &apos;d like to tell her that I love her .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a wife .
I am very happy with it .
She needs our help .
Tom is coming for dinner .
What &apos;s it going to be like ?
I don &apos;t have a sister .
Tom is his name , I think .
Tom said that , too .
Tom knew .
My work is done .
He looks very good .
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
I have just three dollars left .
You don &apos;t want to go , do you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play outside today .
I was happy .
We &apos;re late .
Tom went home .
Why are they here ?
Please don &apos;t ask me about Tom .
I am having a look at it .
You must do as you are told to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
I gave you a book .
You didn &apos;t let me answer .
Tom hasn &apos;t come yet .
This is all I know .
This is the very book that I want to read .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
We haven &apos;t done a thing all week .
We need Tom .
Tom could &apos;ve bought this car .
Do you know if Tom is here ?
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Do you want this ?
This is the very book that I wanted to read .
I didn &apos;t read any books yesterday .
That &apos;s your answer for everything , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
We can &apos;t help Tom now .
I know who lives in that house .
I &apos;m not going to stop .
I wish you &apos;d stop being afraid of me .
Tom isn &apos;t going to want to do that .
Tom has long hair .
I think they look good .
You know what to do .
What time is it in Boston ?
I &apos;m never late for school .
We often make mistakes .
Tom could do it if he tried .
Tom was born rich .
Tom must have seen me .
I wish that I could give you something .
Why are they doing that ?
They &apos;re rich .
Tom needs money .
Tom was there for me .
Is that really important ?
Did you meet him ?
We didn &apos;t say anything .
Is that as fast as you can go ?
Did you hear about what happened last night ?
You &apos;re not rich .
Tom isn &apos;t lost .
Tom is very young .
I &apos;ll do it myself .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know .
How long are they ?
You &apos;re going to want to see this .
We should do this every day .
Tom went to the hospital .
You shouldn &apos;t talk here .
I should read the book .
We should &apos;ve stayed home with Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom is home .
Tom works .
That book &apos;s mine .
Tom doesn &apos;t like doing that .
I can play tennis .
I &apos;ll meet him tomorrow .
I tried again and again .
Did Tom say why Mary went to Boston ?
She is not here yet .
I haven &apos;t heard anything .
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
I like what I like .
It was nice meeting you here .
Tom can &apos;t work tomorrow .
That &apos;s no longer possible .
I know Tom isn &apos;t alone .
We &apos;re here to help them .
The dog seems to have been sick .
I do understand .
That &apos;s all I know .
My son came to my room .
You still have much to learn .
Would you like anything else ?
I asked what was wrong .
We are at school together .
I &apos;ll come back later .
What is it now , Tom ?
It was Tom &apos;s .
It doesn &apos;t look good .
These books are very old .
We have to have this .
Please read the whole story .
I wrote Mary a letter .
Give me my beer .
Don &apos;t give me that , Tom .
I thought you said you didn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
Tom must &apos;ve left .
Have you thought of that ?
When are you going home ?
Tom already knows that .
This is better .
We need money .
You &apos;re not as important as you think you are .
That &apos;s better .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
It &apos;s all over .
I need the money .
Tom has a daughter who &apos;s very beautiful .
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon .
Tom might be early .
I don &apos;t believe anything Tom says .
That didn &apos;t used to happen .
I said I &apos;d be there .
I know how hard this must be .
This is good coffee .
We &apos;re not doing it .
I can &apos;t wait that long .
You can go or stay , as you wish .
Tom will be here in a while .
Are you here ?
I think that Tom should do that .
Tom came on his own .
Tell me why you did it .
It &apos;s not us who did it .
She loves us .
I wonder why Tom is doing that .
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
Tom said you &apos;d know .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to go .
Tom needs someone to talk to .
I understand everything .
Tom made Mary do the work .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
Why would you want to do something like that ?
Her story can &apos;t be true .
I think you &apos;ll like it too .
What time is it now in Boston ?
You really need a woman .
I &apos;ll come , too .
I know your mother .
They have come .
My mother was usually very busy .
I don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before .
Do you know it ?
Who &apos;s she ?
What &apos;s his name again ?
I saw Tom &apos;s father .
Can we wait for Tom here ?
It has never been done before .
We really need a man like you here .
I was just having a little fun .
Just let me go .
Tom wasn &apos;t tired .
I know that I &apos;m right .
Tom says he likes it .
Tom is coming today .
She looks like her mother .
I have nothing to do with this accident .
She is her friend .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
Tom is not here .
Tom bought a car last week .
What &apos;re you going to say ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
I would like to visit you .
I have often heard him say that .
I do think so .
We play tennis after school .
Maybe I don &apos;t need Tom .
I wanted to help you .
I don &apos;t love you anymore .
She makes me happy .
She wanted to be alone .
Tom went to the park to meet Mary .
I bought her a new car .
Tom looks a bit tired .
Are you Tom ?
We &apos;ve seen them .
What do you think I should &apos;ve done ?
You can &apos;t drink the water here .
I thought of Tom right away .
I &apos;ve seen that , too .
Tom had an accident .
They know about it .
I won &apos;t need you .
You and I are old friends .
I can hardly swim .
Is that what you want , Tom ?
You should come .
We have three minutes .
Did Tom see that ?
Tom almost died in that accident .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom not to come .
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
Where are your children now ?
I &apos;ll be home alone all night .
What are you doing in Tom &apos;s car ?
Are these Tom &apos;s shoes ?
You should leave .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
We &apos;ll go with you .
You had better go to bed now .
It wasn &apos;t me . It was the cat .
Tom is from Australia .
Tom speaks French as well as English .
Why did you go to Boston ?
We won &apos;t be going to Tom &apos;s party .
Tom thought about this .
Tom died alone .
He didn &apos;t know what to say .
You won &apos;t remember a thing .
I read a few books last week .
My friends don &apos;t know where I am .
You have to believe in yourself .
Tom wanted to get married , but Mary didn &apos;t .
Why in the world did you do that ?
Tom died a few hours later .
You &apos;ll like Tom .
That was enough .
I want a word with you .
I &apos;m so sorry to hear that .
You like it , don &apos;t you ?
Tom is never at home .
There was much work to do .
Where does Tom live now ?
Is that what you want to do ?
It &apos;s better than nothing .
My brother is a teacher .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants .
Let Tom do anything he wants .
This bus is going to Boston .
How is Tom going to do that ?
I want Tom to leave .
I couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
Could you please take me back home ?
He always looked happy , but never was .
I have a brother who lives in Australia .
Let &apos;s take the bus .
I want one , too .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t have to .
This is the most fun I &apos;ve had in a long time .
The days are getting longer and longer .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
She gave him something to drink .
We know you &apos;re very rich .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night .
Where is your brother ?
Please have someone else do that .
She is everything to him .
Just be yourself .
I want you to be my friend again .
My father died five years ago .
I know what those books are like .
He looks like a good boy .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
Tom is a good student , isn &apos;t he ?
Why exactly would I do that ?
There are only three days left .
I can &apos;t talk about it right now .
Tom and I are very busy just now .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
We &apos;re short on time .
Tom saw everything .
I hope Tom &apos;s right .
They &apos;re in .
I &apos;ve only done this once before .
I &apos;d like to stay a little longer .
That &apos;s what everyone does .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do that .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom likes me .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom will come or not .
The problem was too much for me .
Are you important ?
I have read that story in some book .
I like this .
We &apos;re a little busy right now .
I think that Tom was born in Australia .
I &apos;d be up for that .
Tom made dinner .
Is this your money ?
Tell me everything you know about that .
Get Tom something to drink .
Is it there ?
I have everything I wanted .
You &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s too big .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to him .
We &apos;re rich .
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us .
They want to come .
The dog went away .
Tom did that very well .
He does not know .
I don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s office is .
Tom is at the hotel now .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom knows what he &apos;s going to do .
Where &apos;s the hospital ?
I &apos;m happy for both of you .
Who lives here ?
I &apos;m not so sure .
Come and see me once in a while .
Why were you in Boston last week ?
Where does he work ?
It looks like Tom .
I just want to go to sleep .
Tom just sat around and did nothing .
I &apos;m going to go to the doctor this afternoon .
What have you done with the watch I bought for you ?
We need this .
Tom knows that we know .
I have some food .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
Can &apos;t you help me just a little bit ?
I want to go and see Tom .
I know what &apos;s good for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about this .
You have to live here .
Do you have many friends ?
I have to live with it .
He often comes late to school .
Tom is going to like me .
There &apos;s enough food for all of you .
I said get up !
Don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did today .
Where were you today ?
Did you catch the first train ?
That girl looks like her mother .
She can &apos;t have said so .
Tom left quickly .
I told Tom to help Mary , but he didn &apos;t .
It &apos;s not a dog .
What &apos;s it like ?
This book isn &apos;t mine .
Tom wants to go .
I have to stay home today .
My mother is not always at home .
I didn &apos;t go .
Can anyone hear me ?
I &apos;ll work on that .
Is that too difficult ?
How are you doing ?
I often make mistakes .
There &apos;s no water .
You &apos;re doing it wrong !
It &apos;s up to you , Tom .
Tom has to come to Boston .
I am happy to have so many good friends .
Tom knows what it takes .
Tom need not have worried .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I think I know why you &apos;re here .
Tom was in his office all morning .
Let me do that for you .
Is this our hotel ?
Tom was out of town last week .
I would never do anything like that .
My whole family &apos;s from Boston .
We both want to go to Boston .
I &apos;m in the car .
Do you want to know how ?
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Tom isn &apos;t happy about this .
I &apos;ll live .
I can drive a car , but Tom can &apos;t .
How old is your daughter ?
If you really want to know , all you need to do is ask .
Tom was up late last night studying .
Tom has got a plan .
Tom was just about to leave .
I had a good night &apos;s sleep .
That &apos;s not why .
That &apos;s how we do it in Boston .
Tom knows about that .
I &apos;ve got no friends .
What did the doctor tell you ?
Who told Tom ?
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
We &apos;ll meet Tom .
I don &apos;t think I know you .
How many people work there ?
I don &apos;t want Tom here .
It doesn &apos;t look so bad .
This is for you , Tom .
What are you up to today ?
I want to believe you .
Does Tom have more than one girlfriend ?
I heard about it .
Where &apos;s Tom when you need him ?
I &apos;ve still got things to do .
Does Tom have one ?
How about tonight ?
We have to be there Monday .
That is the house where he lives .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary will come .
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
Tom knows something we don &apos;t .
It &apos;s our car .
Are you busy these days ?
She is working night and day .
I have eyes .
Tom won &apos;t live much longer .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what Mary said .
You &apos;d better go back home now .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom has gone home early .
I just want to help .
You &apos;re not going to do that , are you ?
I &apos;ll get this to Tom .
There &apos;s so much I want to say to you .
If I had enough money , I would buy the book .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it better .
I wrote this letter in French .
You should &apos;ve told me the truth .
Tom bought a dog .
I want Tom to read this .
Tom and Mary will be going home soon .
I &apos;ll do what I want .
Tom knows I know .
I know Tom had nothing to do with that .
There &apos;s something here Tom should see .
We can &apos;t stay here .
Tom was late .
I &apos;m not like Tom .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I was the one who said we should wait .
I am happy with my girlfriend .
He can swim .
He had no friend to help him .
Why &apos;s Tom so good at French ?
I don &apos;t want to talk to him anymore .
Tom said he &apos;d do that .
You &apos;re going to like it .
Tom will be working at home tomorrow .
I know Tom likes me .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
Where &apos;s the money ?
Tom had no plan at all .
There &apos;s no other way to say this .
Tom is going to school in Boston .
I would like to say something .
Tom didn &apos;t give it to me .
I &apos;d like to see it .
The world is a big place .
We &apos;re brother and sister .
We need a doctor .
Tom gave everything he had .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
I &apos;m not going to Boston .
I did that a lot .
Tom should have told Mary the truth .
We &apos;re not doing this again .
Tom has too many books .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to like this .
These are for you .
Tom made Mary one of these , too .
When will you leave ?
Tom seems quite busy .
I have what you want .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
I know the reason , but I can &apos;t tell you .
I know .
Tom wanted to eat the whole cake .
I &apos;m not Tom . I &apos;m John .
You &apos;re worried .
I &apos;ve read both these books .
It &apos;s almost six .
Tom did it himself .
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
I &apos;m sorry , my father is out .
Tom needs a friend .
I will see them next week .
We will talk about this later .
These people have lost everything .
Have you seen my watch ?
What can you tell me about it ?
Where &apos;s my beer ?
Tom died just as he was trying to say something to Mary .
When did you go ?
This isn &apos;t going to be good .
I don &apos;t want her .
How long have you been in town ?
Have your own way .
Can you give me a hand with this table ?
Tom has been working here for over three years .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t have any children .
That &apos;s very big .
I &apos;m sorry .
I was busy all day .
Your French is really quite good .
I &apos;m going again tomorrow .
Are you from Australia ?
Why did Tom give you that ?
That &apos;s what we have to do .
You never say what you really think .
I &apos;m coming home , Tom .
I love my family .
I saw her at the station .
They &apos;re family .
What &apos;s mine is yours .
She was afraid of the dog .
We have to do that .
She is not always happy .
What does Tom see in Mary ?
I &apos;m not a good person .
I can &apos;t live that kind of life .
Don &apos;t close your eyes .
I &apos;m not very good at French .
How is life ?
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the last three days .
What do I need ?
He &apos;s fast .
Mary and I became good friends .
I never thought I &apos;d find a woman like you .
I don &apos;t like Boston that much .
Nobody is really sure .
They don &apos;t get it .
I &apos;m going to school .
Tom fell .
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
Is there a cat under the table ?
Tom has a lot of friends .
I hardly know anything about Australia .
Tom didn &apos;t have much to say .
I got home and took my shoes off .
She came into the room .
Tom isn &apos;t like us .
There you are .
He wanted to be rich .
He wanted to meet me .
I don &apos;t go to school .
I will make her happy .
What &apos;s wrong ?
How about your place ?
You &apos;re very good .
It &apos;s not so far .
Tom and I were alone .
I know what Tom likes .
You &apos;re so young .
I think about her a lot .
Why do you have to be like that ?
She gets up early .
I don &apos;t like it .
There is one thing I want to ask .
Tom knew what kind of woman Mary was .
The job is as good as done .
What else do we have ?
She gets tired quickly .
I &apos;m sorry for you .
We need that money .
It &apos;s my life .
A lot of students around the world are studying English .
You told me that before .
I think you know I like you .
Tom wanted to stay .
I want to tell you the truth .
She went to the hospital yesterday .
Tom likes his new job .
My mother gets up early .
I heard you last night , Tom .
You have no idea what happened , do you ?
I knew too much .
What do I have to do ?
Take your time .
We really have to go .
That boy looks like you .
All the food was gone .
Tom has gone to school .
I &apos;ve already told you what I think .
Where can we meet you ?
Where did you get that hat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t often do that .
Tom can &apos;t speak French well .
I know you &apos;re here , Tom .
This one is for Tom .
That &apos;s what I would &apos;ve done .
We were on the train for ten hours .
I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;d like to , but I can &apos;t .
Don &apos;t you want to see your room ?
I think Tom will listen to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
Tom had a cat .
Tom almost never says anything .
I don &apos;t believe it at all .
Tom is the person to ask .
Tom must be very happy .
Don &apos;t you want to know where I was ?
Can you stand ?
Tom isn &apos;t there , is he ?
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to bed so late yesterday .
Nobody is doing anything .
I may not do that .
I &apos;ll go home .
I &apos;m not coming home .
He &apos;s not my father .
He kept me waiting .
It &apos;s still mine .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re looking good .
Do you want to learn French ?
Are you still together ?
I met them .
Do you have one ?
I think Tom is sick .
You must go .
They had only one child .
I feel well today .
We need water .
I &apos;m going to the park .
You know that , don &apos;t you ?
Have you finished ?
She asked me for help .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
Can you see anything out there ?
I know about you and Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to help Tom .
May I speak to you ?
Please come as soon as possible .
We don &apos;t really have to talk about this right now , do we ?
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom knows nothing about Boston .
I really am sorry .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
What do you plan on doing tonight ?
What do you see in Tom ?
What &apos;re you doing out here ?
I have no idea what this is .
You should get yourself a new car now .
Tom is out , but Mary is here .
You don &apos;t work here .
Tom made me go .
I &apos;m not really that sorry .
Where have you been all day ?
I don &apos;t know if I should tell Tom .
I &apos;m here , aren &apos;t I ?
How do we look ?
There was no answer to my question .
I think about her often .
Tom and I always tell each other everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to be alone .
Tom is doing his homework .
I don &apos;t want to be you .
I don &apos;t like your name .
Did anyone tell Tom ?
I don &apos;t know what to do or what to say .
I really need it .
I go right home after work .
I know someone who speaks French very well .
We can speak French .
Where &apos;s my phone ?
We &apos;ll soon find out .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that .
I know why we &apos;re doing this .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here .
That &apos;s our train .
I &apos;d really like to help .
Could you please tell me what &apos;s wrong ?
I closed my door .
I saw Tom a few minutes ago .
We can &apos;t go right now .
What did they find ?
The idea is not bad .
I &apos;m not sure he wants to talk to me .
There are almost no books .
I just ate .
I can &apos;t tell you any more than that .
Tom tried to leave , but Mary wouldn &apos;t let him .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
You &apos;d better not go there again .
Tell me everything you know .
I think both of them are right .
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
Let &apos;s walk .
I need it by tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants .
We &apos;re not lost .
Tom isn &apos;t going to sing .
We aren &apos;t children .
I saw a dog .
She says that she wants me to come with her .
I can do that right now .
Tom looked about .
Give me a reason .
Tell me the reason you didn &apos;t come yesterday .
I forget who said it .
I &apos;m not like you .
I wish I could come with you .
Tom got there long after we did .
Tom can &apos;t come with us .
I &apos;ll talk to Tom .
I can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re really here .
How do I get to the station from here ?
I made these .
I don &apos;t want to come to Boston .
She was there in the morning .
Do you want to see Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
I don &apos;t know why they did that .
What &apos;s the name of your dog ?
There &apos;s no reason to do that .
How are you today ?
How many people are there in this room ?
He wouldn &apos;t listen to my advice .
I didn &apos;t expect you to get here so soon .
You should know that .
I am afraid of what the teacher will say .
Could you have done that ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom can swim .
That &apos;s what I have to do .
They &apos;re bad .
I think you &apos;ll like this .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
I don &apos;t know the reason why she isn &apos;t coming .
Tom won &apos;t be coming to our party .
This isn &apos;t possible without Tom &apos;s help .
What are you and Tom up to ?
It was night .
Have you told Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing it that way ?
It &apos;s still possible .
What makes you happy ?
I should tell Tom to try it .
I don &apos;t want to be late today .
I know what &apos;s going on .
This is all the money that I have now .
I can &apos;t give Tom everything he wants .
That &apos;s what I think .
She was so tired that she couldn &apos;t walk .
No one has seen Tom .
Tom would like nothing more than to tell Mary everything .
Tom is still living at home with his parents .
Tom said it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
I &apos;d like to see her .
We &apos;re home .
I know the problem .
I still want to go .
I &apos;m going , too .
Tom came alone .
Everyone in my family is happy .
We want to talk .
What &apos;s today &apos;s plan ?
Come back in a month .
What are you doing here so late at night ?
When are you coming back home ?
They love that .
I go to school with Tom .
Tell Tom what to do .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
When do we have to do that ?
Tom can &apos;t do this as well as I can .
What is Tom to you ?
I wonder who they are .
I think he has done it .
She &apos;s beautiful .
How long do I have to wait ?
I am going to buy a new car .
I would like to hear your opinion .
Tom is too good for you .
Tom and I are very busy .
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
I won &apos;t come .
I love Tom &apos;s car .
I still love Mary .
That &apos;s not quite right .
Tom died in Australia .
When are you coming to Boston ?
I &apos;ll give you this .
That &apos;s all wrong .
Tom can &apos;t buy what he wants to buy because he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
It &apos;s your money .
What don &apos;t you want us to see ?
Tom and Mary want to tell us something .
What &apos;ll you drink ?
I need to know how this happened .
This one &apos;s my room , Tom .
I wish I could stop thinking about Tom .
I don &apos;t know what to do right now .
When I &apos;m with you , I &apos;m happy .
You &apos;re very beautiful .
She looks young .
He seemed to know everything about me .
No one seems to have any idea where Tom is .
I &apos;ve come for Tom .
You never should &apos;ve let Tom go to Boston with Mary .
He tried it over and over again .
We don &apos;t live here .
Tom wanted to leave .
Tom has turned thirty .
I &apos;ve only had one girlfriend .
My mother doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom has been here three years .
Are you happy , Tom ?
That &apos;s what I thought .
She was there all morning .
What was there ?
I can &apos;t remember exactly how old I was when I first met Tom .
Do you have a book ?
Tom knows Mary knows .
I want to know your opinion .
How come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
Everyone &apos;s doing it .
Is that Tom ?
My family thinks I &apos;m rich .
Are you still Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Don &apos;t you want to see Tom ?
You don &apos;t want me here , do you ?
Tom knows how to read French .
Your house is big .
What do you want me to do about it ?
What are you going to make ?
I need to go home .
I &apos;m sorry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .
I just wanted to see what would happen .
Tell Tom you want to go to Boston .
I know how much you care about Tom .
We &apos;ll have to do something .
I know what &apos;s wrong .
Tom has been here for three years .
If you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll ask someone else to help me .
I don &apos;t want to do this here .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m ready .
I lost it .
Can you tell me what this is ?
Tom asked Mary to give him some money .
The girl wanted to tell him the truth , but she couldn &apos;t .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s teacher is .
Will you let Tom leave ?
It &apos;s time for dinner .
Tom can &apos;t remember .
I don &apos;t know and I don &apos;t want to know .
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
He has a hat on .
I &apos;ve never had a friend quite like you .
Tom is already really good .
My brother has been sick since yesterday .
I &apos;m a high school student .
I hardly ever get sick .
I want to get as far away from here as I can .
Tom is better at doing that than me .
I want to stay a few days .
I think Tom is from Australia .
I &apos;m going to have to go home early today .
Did Tom really say that ?
I want some water .
You lost .
When are you going ?
I think I see the problem .
Do you have it with you ?
Tom looked sick .
You &apos;re my woman .
Don &apos;t worry about it . It &apos;s not your problem .
I said I &apos;d do it .
I think that what you need now is to eat something .
Do you want these ?
I &apos;ve often heard about you .
You should stay in school .
That &apos;s what I want .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
They &apos;ll remember .
I &apos;d like to learn French .
I &apos;ve got a lot of friends .
Who wrote this ?
Tom is good at French , isn &apos;t he ?
There was a cat on the table .
Tom works for Mary &apos;s father .
I went to the hospital .
I believe that the story is true .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
Tom came just before dinner .
We &apos;re about to go home .
How long do I have ?
Tom always speaks in French .
The only person Tom knows here is me .
We have everything .
What has Tom seen ?
You &apos;d better do that now .
He made a mistake .
We &apos;ll come together .
I saw him there .
I didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
I don &apos;t have to study French .
What &apos;s going on , Tom ?
Tom and Mary are waiting outside .
Tom will sing .
I can &apos;t do anything for Tom .
What did Tom do with the money ?
When was the last time you saw her ?
I haven &apos;t seen you in three years .
I &apos;ll make you happy .
You don &apos;t want to know .
I don &apos;t want to play .
I don &apos;t know Tom as well as I know you .
No one knows me like you do .
I wish that you wouldn &apos;t do that .
How do you do this ?
Tom gave me a hard time .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working here .
I have work to do .
You can &apos;t help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day .
I told Tom not to come .
I &apos;m here to take Tom home .
Tom knew too much .
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
I want that one .
Tom was busy all day .
You &apos;d better not eat too much .
They found this .
I know her very well .
I want to be able to speak French .
Tom was there before anyone else .
If that &apos;s true , then she &apos;s better than me .
I asked Tom where he &apos;d been .
I want a dog .
How does Tom look ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school anymore .
He is my brother , not father .
She didn &apos;t say a word to me all night .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
Can &apos;t we just go home ?
He was angry with his daughter .
Tom doesn &apos;t do much .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
Who found them ?
Tom will do anything we want him to do .
Tom has never been so happy .
You must be the new teacher .
She takes after her mother .
I hope you &apos;re right .
We have to find it before Tom does .
I &apos;d like you to see this .
I can &apos;t wait for you .
I know who she is .
I &apos;ll believe it when I see it .
This man loves my sister .
He is my brother , not my father .
I don &apos;t know anything about him at all .
She hit me , not him .
I &apos;d better see him .
I &apos;m sure that Tom will be here soon .
I &apos;m free today .
Tom is going to be a father soon .
I want that .
I can &apos;t see you .
Tom said Mary is at home .
I read your letter to my family .
I thought it was pretty good .
Who is there ?
What was Tom doing in Australia last month ?
I think you &apos;re going to like Tom .
Tom told Mary that she was right .
I wish Tom was here .
He &apos;s still young .
I gave him a few books .
I think it won &apos;t be a problem .
Tom was in Boston last week .
You do look a little better today .
When is school over ?
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours .
I wanted to go there .
Tom wants to go to Australia .
I &apos;d like a word with you .
That &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
Why didn &apos;t you listen to me ?
It makes all the children happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
I want to see it .
You have only to give him a little help .
I &apos;m here again .
My sister is too young to go to school .
I met him .
I go to school .
It isn &apos;t easy .
I &apos;m going to make you happy .
I &apos;ll go and see Tom .
Tom knows Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom and I don &apos;t always agree .
I love my mother very much .
Tom made a big mistake .
I &apos;m going to drive myself .
She said that she had been happy .
We &apos;re in Boston .
I love that book .
I wish I could stay here with you today .
I asked where he had been .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go .
I was the only man .
I &apos;m sorry . I really have to go .
I am fine .
Tom and I want to study French .
I &apos;ve been here for three hours .
That &apos;s hard to believe .
The only one here who doesn &apos;t enjoy doing that is Tom .
I wish someone would help me do that .
We &apos;ll go together .
I &apos;m going to swim every day .
Please tell me the answer to the question .
I &apos;ve got everything I want .
I like English .
Do you want him ?
Tom never wrote to me .
You know why I &apos;m here .
Tom can &apos;t read French .
She gave him a book .
I already told you that she isn &apos;t here .
I don &apos;t like what you said about Tom .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
Are you up ?
Tom is going to Boston on Monday .
The house is pretty .
Have you seen it ?
It &apos;s not a problem .
I want you to leave right now .
I don &apos;t want to take your money .
Who are these people ?
Let &apos;s not speak French today .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;m not about to stop .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here .
I never swim by myself .
They want me .
She isn &apos;t young .
They haven &apos;t arrived yet .
Tom can &apos;t remember anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
You never do anything right , do you ?
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m going to study English this afternoon .
What don &apos;t you want me to see ?
Tom made that himself .
You have to go whether you like it or not .
You are exactly like your mother .
His story must be true .
She doesn &apos;t like going to school .
This is from Tom .
I &apos;d like to go .
No one &apos;s looking at you .
We &apos;re both from Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
I don &apos;t need any help .
She gave it to him .
This dog isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
You can &apos;t make everyone happy all the time .
You know his name , don &apos;t you ?
That isn &apos;t my problem .
I have a lot of homework .
You don &apos;t know what I know .
Tom looked at his watch .
We don &apos;t have enough beer .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
I won &apos;t be coming to school anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me .
She did the work alone .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
All of us plan to do that .
When are you going to get married ?
He is a teacher .
Tom asked me if I knew his father .
When do I get there ?
I am glad to help you .
Why don &apos;t you say something ?
Tom won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Is it good ?
Tom and I are with Mary .
Tom &apos;s father died before Tom was born .
I don &apos;t want to do that again .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary will come tomorrow .
I want people to see it .
I am coming .
I will help him tomorrow .
How &apos;s that again ?
We &apos;re reading .
When did you buy this car ?
I &apos;m busy right now and can &apos;t play with you .
He will come this afternoon .
Can we talk to Tom ?
I haven &apos;t got all day .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go home .
Tom did nothing .
I love this picture .
Tom said he isn &apos;t happy .
What do you want to do ?
I never knew Tom could speak French .
What are you doing out so late ?
That would be a mistake .
I &apos;ll take it to Tom .
I let Tom leave .
Tom didn &apos;t give us any money .
I don &apos;t have a picture of you .
What &apos;re you going to do ?
Are your parents home ?
Tom &apos;s angry .
He lives alone .
The news can &apos;t be true .
Where does Tom work ?
He &apos;s the man that was here last week .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll find a way .
I don &apos;t really like to talk about it .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston .
I &apos;ll do it again .
Tom told Mary the whole story .
It cannot last long .
Why was I never told about this ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told me what to do .
What do you think they are ?
No one asked any questions .
He hasn &apos;t come yet .
I have never read that book .
How about some music ?
I &apos;ll be in my office from ten tomorrow .
Do you know how to drive a car ?
Why did you do what you did ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Where is Tom working now ?
I didn &apos;t mean it .
Are you ready , Tom ?
He is playing music .
I want to show you something .
Where did you find Tom ?
Why did Tom want you here ?
Just don &apos;t say anything .
Tom and I had a lot of fun together .
They were busy .
Can &apos;t we just talk this over ?
Tom gave this to me .
Maybe we can talk about that later .
Tom could have helped me , but he didn &apos;t .
She doesn &apos;t live with him .
I &apos;ll see Tom .
I know what they are thinking .
You aren &apos;t watching .
I know how it is .
Have you told your parents ?
We &apos;re going to wait until Tom gets here .
Tom asked me for money .
Tom said something .
I thought it was best not to say anything .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t like to do ?
We both know you don &apos;t live where you say you do .
We &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
Do you know how to speak English ?
I love this school .
You know what Tom &apos;s answer is going to be .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to do that for you ?
Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I just want to find out what happened .
Don &apos;t you have something to say to Tom ?
Tom has some advice for us .
Tom is playing in his room .
They look busy .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
I don &apos;t know how to drive .
What does that say ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
Tom , you &apos;ve got to talk to Mary .
I know a man who can speak French well .
I must get back to work .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve never seen her .
I will wait .
Can I sleep here ?
Tom said you would come .
We &apos;ve been asked to leave .
Do as you please .
Tom said something to Mary .
He gave in .
I should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
I love life .
I want that job .
They are talking about music .
This table is in the way .
I &apos;m sorry , but he isn &apos;t home .
It &apos;s good to be back in Boston .
I &apos;m so sorry for what I did .
Tom never left .
Tom was kept waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ll go with Tom .
I am going , too .
That is his car .
Are you sure you &apos;re not tired ?
What am I going to do without Tom ?
I have to do this before class .
I &apos;m not too late , am I ?
I have to stop .
The station is not far from here .
He can play tennis very well .
You &apos;re too good to me .
Tom has to do it .
This isn &apos;t a hospital .
Why not go to Boston ?
We &apos;ve found something .
Why do you want to stop here ?
He did a pretty good job .
Did you talk to Tom about it ?
I needed to talk to you .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait for Tom ?
I don &apos;t understand that question .
We can &apos;t have you working for us .
Why is Tom not here ?
Don &apos;t ask for money .
That &apos;s just what one would expect of him .
Your plan seems better than mine .
I &apos;m good at what I do .
You &apos;ll be happy .
Is there anything else you want me to do ?
Do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
I love this game .
I &apos;m only going to show you once .
I know what it &apos;s like .
It is said that he is sick .
English is difficult to learn .
Tom likes you very much .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
It isn &apos;t Tom .
Who doesn &apos;t do that ?
Tom needs time .
What &apos;s there to say ?
I need more money .
A man like me needs a hat .
I want to go to the park .
What do you want me to do for you ?
He was made to wait at the station for two hours .
She &apos;s wearing a hat .
Do you know why he wasn &apos;t at school ?
You &apos;d better go by bus .
He wants to come with us .
It was easy for me to do so .
What &apos;re you thinking ?
There wasn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Tom cannot drive .
I need to go eat something .
I &apos;m not going to be there .
I knew you were going to ask that .
No one knows their name .
I don &apos;t know why they do it .
Tom wouldn &apos;t know .
That has nothing to do with this problem .
Is this your opinion ?
Is this the train for Boston ?
I love being alone .
I don &apos;t want to know his name .
I can &apos;t help but think you &apos;re making a mistake .
I &apos;m not Tom .
I &apos;d love to see this movie .
Is it really possible ?
I wonder what it could be .
What &apos;s mine &apos;s yours .
I can &apos;t talk about this right now .
When was the last time that you did something for the first time ?
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary &apos;s over thirty .
You should try to be more like Tom .
Tom loves reading .
What does he mean to do ?
Tom should be studying French now .
I would do it if I could .
I think Tom wants more .
I think he &apos;ll come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary has done .
The girl did not say anything .
The train hasn &apos;t come yet .
He looked well .
I was not a bit tired .
I love you more than anything in the world .
I bought a lot of books .
Tom said something in French that I couldn &apos;t understand .
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished his homework yet .
Tom has nothing else to do .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for me .
It is difficult to talk to him .
Tom found Mary .
They enjoy one another &apos;s company .
I do not know when she will come back .
How did you enjoy the party ?
They say he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;ve heard quite a lot about you .
Tom is a hard person to please .
You can believe me .
I wanted to do that last week , but didn &apos;t have the time .
Would you care to try ?
I think that would be good .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find a job .
Are we done yet ?
We work together .
Where &apos;s Tom playing ?
I wish I &apos;d been there .
Tom asked me a question .
What are you doing here ?
I came here as fast as I could .
They were in that room with me all night .
We have to get it done now .
I have enough money .
I can sing it in English .
My father has many books .
I don &apos;t think Tom speaks French .
He hasn &apos;t done anything .
I know he did it .
We &apos;ll take my car .
I want to go with Tom .
They are the same age .
Tom said he would do it again .
Why do I need to be in Boston ?
Tom was like a father to Mary .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
I think about Tom all day .
We understand that .
She doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
You shouldn &apos;t eat here .
I saw Tom and his dog in the park .
Tom has enough money .
Can I talk to you a moment ?
Why are you looking at me ?
Is this a good time to buy a house ?
There it is !
It &apos;s not possible .
We &apos;re here because we want to talk to Tom .
That cannot be true .
Tom &apos;s dog is very big .
Tom won &apos;t be going to school next week .
You should &apos;ve told the truth .
You are a doctor .
Tom already left .
I got here as soon as I heard you needed me .
Why aren &apos;t they back ?
I think that car is Tom &apos;s .
Why don &apos;t you just go home ?
I &apos;m not old .
I took off my hat .
Tom likes to stay at home alone .
I &apos;m never going to leave you again .
No one has that right .
Tom is the only friend I have here in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here , does he ?
What else could it be ?
I know you can do it .
I &apos;d like to read it .
She had nothing to do yesterday .
He won &apos;t listen to me .
Tom is in his room now .
Tom looks asleep .
Everyone likes her .
He is getting better day by day .
I don &apos;t have any more money .
He knows us very well .
We want it .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I saw you so happy .
How long do I have to stay here ?
How would you like it if someone did that to you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
I &apos;ll be with you in a few minutes .
I &apos;ve got an idea .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s taking Tom so long .
He saw the girl .
Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
My house is big .
I don &apos;t understand what you are saying .
Tom can help me .
I &apos;d like to know why you &apos;re here .
I have a table .
I like to do my homework .
Tom wants to stay .
What are you doing here , Tom ? Mary doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
She made him happy .
He is at the office .
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
He is eating .
It won &apos;t work .
This one &apos;s for you , Tom .
What did you say ? I can &apos;t hear you .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe Mary at all .
I want to live in a big city .
What is it you need ?
Tom didn &apos;t have any children .
You have no idea how important you are to me .
I want some money .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what Tom wants or not .
She is not up yet .
I want to be there with Tom .
Tom is not at all happy .
He &apos;s looking at you .
I &apos;ll never help you .
I know you &apos;re happy .
It &apos;s your book .
He &apos;s almost always in the hospital .
You &apos;re like family .
These people are my friends .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
I can &apos;t tell yet .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do anything to help .
I &apos;d love to see you .
I have no time to write to her .
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
Why do I have to study French ?
Are both of you ready to go ?
I want to know about you .
How many times have I asked you to not do that ?
I don &apos;t know what to sing .
What do you want to hear from me ?
Where does he come from ?
We are going to leave tomorrow .
Tom has no idea why Mary did that .
You &apos;d better not tell Tom .
Tom is working on the new plan .
You know what I want , don &apos;t you ?
Tom stopped .
Tom is doing that .
Tom told me he would go to Boston .
This is my other sister .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have kept Mary waiting so long .
That wouldn &apos;t be Tom , would it ?
You can go now .
The boy has a watch in his hand .
I like Boston .
This is my home .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
Tom seems happy .
Tom wants Mary to be happy .
Tom and Mary were often seen together .
What do you have for me today ?
She likes all of us .
We &apos;ll find them .
My father is in the hospital now .
I want to see you .
She &apos;s not young , is she ?
Tom can speak French much better than me .
I know what you &apos;re going to ask .
I walked alone .
I &apos;m almost done .
I want to hear what Tom has to say .
I &apos;m going to leave school .
No one &apos;s going to do that .
I feel fine .
He has come from Boston .
Tom can &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop .
I want to help you with your homework .
I wonder if that &apos;s Tom .
You look exactly like Tom .
Tom was the one .
You may take my word for it .
I don &apos;t want to have anything to do with that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French well .
Do you want to take that ?
I saw you in the park yesterday .
I could help Tom .
Tom is working on it right now .
His brother goes to school by bus .
I told Tom the truth .
They were friends .
I already told my parents .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like that .
That &apos;s my idea .
We &apos;re going to be rich .
Tom is busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like that .
Please tell me the truth .
That &apos;s too good a story to be true .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary the whole truth .
Why is it here ?
You &apos;re not looking .
Tom is home alone with his dog .
Is it the truth ?
His mother was right .
I find this difficult to believe .
I want to go to Australia with my family .
This is a book .
I don &apos;t want your help .
We don &apos;t need to do that now .
He can play tennis .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
I didn &apos;t buy anything .
We &apos;ve seen her .
She told me a lot about you .
How did you find us ?
When can I visit you ?
He is angry with you .
He often doesn &apos;t come to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to do that .
Where am I going to go ?
Tom &apos;ll be here soon .
We go there often .
I &apos;m already ready .
I am no longer tired .
I already know how to drive .
Did that really just happen ?
He got rich quickly .
Tom &apos;s going to Boston on Monday .
Tom went to bed .
Thank Tom for me .
Why are you doing this to me ?
There were a lot of people in the room .
I don &apos;t know why Tom &apos;s doing that .
This car is my father &apos;s .
My father is busy .
I &apos;ll see you when I get there .
Where was he going ?
Could we talk about this later ?
Who &apos;s after you ?
Don &apos;t feel sorry for Tom .
Let Tom know we &apos;ve got a problem .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
I don &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
Where &apos;s the car ?
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is now .
I don &apos;t have anything .
I know how to read French .
What &apos;s it doing out here ?
I would &apos;ve let Tom do it .
We &apos;re getting a new car next month .
Mary was beautiful .
I &apos;ve got just about everything I need .
We &apos;re here to see Tom .
What needs to be done ?
I have to visit Tom .
He needs that money .
How come he didn &apos;t show up ?
I have to leave now .
He gave it a new name .
I left right away .
I don &apos;t know exactly .
Tom will take the bus .
We &apos;ve seen him .
They &apos;re playing together .
What are you going to do ?
Tom asked Mary to tell him where she &apos;d been .
She was busy .
That &apos;ll be fun .
There was nothing you could do about that .
Tom saw Mary in the park .
She likes music very much .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
That is something you should not have said .
I don &apos;t want anything to drink .
I &apos;ll take that one .
What &apos;s up with you ?
This is the first time I &apos;ve seen anything like this .
Tom never seems to know what to say .
He tried to speak French to us .
Is your father rich ?
Tom asked Mary to help .
I can do it by myself !
You &apos;re just a boy .
Tom was born on a Monday .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
Tom will be back in an hour .
I didn &apos;t see you .
I didn &apos;t see you at Tom &apos;s party last night .
I &apos;ve never met her .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything .
Why didn &apos;t you just say that to Tom ?
Did Tom tell you what to do ?
Do come to the party .
I didn &apos;t say that .
I &apos;m thinking about something else .
I &apos;ll never forget this .
That &apos;s my boy .
Tom and Mary have what they want .
I don &apos;t want someone else . I want you .
Tom isn &apos;t going to want Mary to do that .
When did that happen ?
Would you like to play with us ?
Tom was in the room .
You &apos;re here early .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
That &apos;s just not true .
I love you more than you love me .
I hope we &apos;ll never have to do that again .
I just heard that Tom and Mary are going to get married .
I have to come on Monday .
Tom is going out with Mary .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
Tom wasn &apos;t as surprised as I was .
When do you study ?
I can &apos;t read yet .
Where &apos;s Tom going ?
Tom had to stay in the hospital .
Tom will probably be busy tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever speak French anymore .
He is happy .
I &apos;ll give you something .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m right .
It might be fun .
I wanted to stay there two days longer .
I thought you said Tom was in Boston .
You work too much .
I think I might be in Boston next Monday .
Tom ran out of food .
It &apos;ll be difficult to do that .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
I know it myself .
Tom often goes to Boston .
I know how many of them there are .
You know how they are .
Maybe it &apos;s true .
Tom doesn &apos;t tell me anything .
Tom can &apos;t hear anything .
If you eat so much , you &apos;ll get sick .
Tom probably likes Mary .
Tom is going to tell the truth .
What will your wife think ?
They saw you .
I have to go to the hospital .
I &apos;m still angry .
I have some money with me .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
How about this one ?
I &apos;m coming for Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me Tom was here ?
I &apos;d like a little more time .
Tom let me drive his car .
Did Tom speak French to you ?
I want to hear what you have to say .
I must see it .
Tom was right after all .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
We &apos;re not doing anything .
You &apos;d better not wait here .
I &apos;ve never had that problem before .
I still love you .
He can &apos;t swim .
It would be a good idea to try doing that .
Maybe we already have enough money to buy a house .
What are they doing out there ?
Tom never made it home .
You &apos;ll need more .
There &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
I could hardly tell who was who .
We &apos;re not from around here .
I know what you said .
I think that she will not come .
What do you like most about Boston ?
What was it like ?
Everyone is talking about Tom .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
I love coming to Boston .
Maybe they should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
What did they say ?
Did you do your work ?
I want more .
Give me that .
I got up early to catch the first train .
I knew what needed to be done .
Tom left right away .
Do you know who lives in that house ?
She didn &apos;t go there yesterday .
I don &apos;t want you to see my daughter anymore .
I need to have a talk with you .
Tom speaks French much better than English .
That &apos;s not what I said at all .
I know most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
He was young .
I did nothing all day .
I want a family .
I gave him all the money I had .
Tom has gone to the park .
I wish I could be in Boston now .
I had a good idea .
He had a dog .
I don &apos;t have it .
Everyone is happy .
I don &apos;t believe everything Tom says .
You have to come home .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
Can &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
I &apos;ll go next month .
I know why you &apos;re here .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom is a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stay long .
He takes after his father .
We &apos;re still in Boston .
I &apos;d like you to see it .
This is the girl that came yesterday .
I don &apos;t have Tom &apos;s money .
He doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
Where &apos;s Tom been ?
I can &apos;t work like this .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to wait for Mary .
I have a little money .
I believe that Tom can do that .
I can see why Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom isn &apos;t as young as I am .
Tom took the money off the table .
How many hours a day do you study French ?
I know things you don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t have to eat .
You may have it .
I can &apos;t go with you .
The door won &apos;t close .
I &apos;m the only person Tom knows in this town .
Tom wants to go home .
I want to see it for myself .
You know how .
I &apos;m going outside .
I have been busy .
Did you give Tom something to eat ?
This wasn &apos;t my mistake .
This is his house .
You have only three minutes left .
I am a teacher , too .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
Just do it .
Tom will have to wait .
This is the book I want to read .
You &apos;re tired .
Tom seems to be happy .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to swim .
You &apos;re quite right .
Tom is the kind of person who always has to have the last word .
I do want it .
We want to know why Tom did it .
Did Tom talk to you about that ?
When did you finish the work ?
You &apos;re better than me .
I think Tom is happy .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom told me to speak to you in French .
Tom will never stop .
What does Tom have to do with this ?
He went home yesterday .
I found something .
We know what we have to do .
I thought Tom was your brother .
I think you did a great job .
Who told you that I was sick ?
We learn French at school .
Tom is going to like that .
Tom speaks a little French .
Tom can &apos;t buy a car .
I just need more time with Tom .
I didn &apos;t think anyone still lived in this house .
I am like my father .
They &apos;re in the car .
She gave up everything for her children .
We have to stop .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished yet .
Tom would never do anything like that .
I saw them yesterday .
They &apos;re surprised .
Tom and Mary are no longer together .
Tom comes to see me almost every day .
Tom got out of bed .
Why don &apos;t we try doing this again tomorrow ?
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go .
That has nothing to do with him .
I will write you back soon .
This we can do .
She will come soon .
I didn &apos;t like that any more than you did .
I have a plan . Don &apos;t worry .
Tom asked me to speak to you .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
I don &apos;t like cold weather .
Tom already ate .
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I want to drive .
I &apos;m still thinking about it .
I &apos;d do it again .
Tom can understand Mary &apos;s French .
Is today Monday ?
I have already done my homework .
Why would Tom want to go there ?
Tom asked a very good question .
I can &apos;t leave Tom behind .
I know your brother .
I can hardly find time to do that anymore .
Mary was Tom &apos;s first girlfriend .
I think Tom likes it .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
Did Tom say he left early ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with us .
We bought this in Australia .
Did you see Tom today ?
I don &apos;t understand what you mean .
What do you want to learn ?
It would be better for you to read more books .
He kept me waiting for a long time .
I think that this is important .
I &apos;m really happy for you .
Tom forgot to do his homework .
When are you busy ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have to do anything .
This has to be the truth .
I &apos;ll go with you .
Did she say that ?
That &apos;s what I want , too .
What &apos;s the plan , Tom ?
How long does it take by car ?
I &apos;ve got to do this .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
Can anybody help me ?
Are you sure Tom is here ?
Do you want to do it with me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to read a book .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t study .
What do you want me to tell Tom ?
He made her happy .
Tom may have read the letter .
I have a car .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t well .
I will show you around the city .
Tom was probably right .
Tom seemed sick .
May I go home now ?
You &apos;re like me .
I &apos;d very much like to go .
I think you &apos;re right .
I never had a car .
He asked me to do it .
They say she &apos;s sick .
You should go home .
I think we &apos;ve got a new problem .
Let me show you how to do that .
You &apos;ve really done a fine job .
We should get going .
I &apos;d like some coffee .
Do you want to take one ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why .
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
I don &apos;t have the time to help you right now .
Tom isn &apos;t the only one here who knows French .
Tom does know that .
Let &apos;s do it again .
That &apos;s not how .
All the students were there .
Tom asked for money .
The dog likes you .
Tom is going to be right back .
Tom knows what &apos;s going on .
I know how to do that .
How does it look ?
Tom can &apos;t drive .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary .
That &apos;s not good .
They want to get married .
These are our books .
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house .
Tom was probably born in Australia .
Tom is my brother .
You haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
That &apos;s what I like to do .
Tom had fun .
I have nothing to say .
I saw how Tom was doing that .
We should go .
How long ago was that ?
I like all of them .
Tom seems pretty happy .
He himself tried it .
I think I &apos;d like that .
They don &apos;t need to do it right away .
I have a question for Tom .
You must think for yourself .
We don &apos;t need your money .
She lives in a large house .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
What is going on ?
Tom has a wife .
Tom really did that well .
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake .
I &apos;m the only one who knows for sure .
I don &apos;t have all day .
I can &apos;t get that out of my mind .
I &apos;ve told you everything I know about Tom .
Tom likes that one .
Tom didn &apos;t mind living by himself .
This isn &apos;t about Tom , is it ?
Does Tom have any family ?
Tom and Mary are here .
I &apos;m going out for a drink .
I couldn &apos;t get him to do it .
They &apos;ve got enough to do already .
I don &apos;t want to meet Tom .
I saw Tom with Mary .
Would you like to play with Tom ?
I didn &apos;t have to do anything .
She cannot have done such a thing .
I &apos;ll make Tom do it .
I don &apos;t want to stop working .
I have to see this .
I have food .
He said that he would help me .
Let &apos;s not ever do this again .
It happened in Boston .
Tom wants to know the truth .
What did he do yesterday ?
We are home .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston .
What is it now ?
We &apos;ll do it .
Tom is in Australia , but Mary isn &apos;t .
They &apos;ll know what to do .
She must have done it yesterday .
I have very little money .
It &apos;s great to have a family .
There was hardly anyone in the room .
Tom will drive you home .
My dog is big .
I don &apos;t think that Tom has a dog .
I only have two children .
I have many books .
Tom , you don &apos;t have to do that .
He speaks quickly .
I &apos;ll wait here until she comes .
I don &apos;t know what that is .
Tom loves Mary .
I know I did that .
These books aren &apos;t for children .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be there .
I think it &apos;s time you and Tom went home .
I know that it &apos;s there .
He doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
Why don &apos;t you try and get some sleep ?
Tom has a lot of friends here .
Are you the new teacher ?
I just need a little time .
I have read the book before .
You did that in school , didn &apos;t you ?
I like my school .
Tom is probably in Australia .
You haven &apos;t said anything to Tom , have you ?
I &apos;d better get back to work .
They made me go there alone .
Tom is always very busy .
I will not help you .
I cannot understand it .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a girlfriend .
Everyone loves him .
Tom and Mary are doing that with John .
It &apos;s hard to please Tom .
I have everything I need .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me much about it .
Is it time ?
How do I do that ?
That &apos;s right !
They won &apos;t tell us anything .
I want what &apos;s mine .
What did Tom have to eat ?
He is his friend .
This isn &apos;t my home .
Can we just go home ?
I think that you &apos;re right .
How many times a week do you study French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like this anymore .
You &apos;re not a child anymore .
Tom asked me to do that for him .
I can &apos;t believe you did this by yourself .
I know what I did .
I know that Tom is from Boston .
This house is too big for us .
I &apos;ve found something I &apos;d like to show you .
I understand .
Tom quickly got to work .
Give them to her .
How would I know where Tom is ?
My brother is now in Australia .
What &apos;s the good news ?
I &apos;ll go to school .
Tom would like to buy a house in Boston .
Is everything ready now ?
Did you do this on your own ?
