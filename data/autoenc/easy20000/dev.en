Tom often doesn &apos;t come to school .
There is a lot of work to do .
My friend has a large family .
I forgot to ask Tom for his advice .
Mary isn &apos;t my sister .
All my friends will be there .
Do you know where Tom is ?
Tom is going to go to Boston by car .
Do you want to leave ?
What are they doing here ?
I told the police everything I know .
I got tired of waiting for Tom .
Tom needs Mary .
Do you have something to say ?
I hope you &apos;ll be able to see Tom soon .
What do you want to do with that ?
Tom can do it .
Tom has almost finished doing that .
I bought it for ten dollars .
There he is .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
I need this job .
They didn &apos;t find Tom .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have any money .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
That &apos;s what I want to do .
We &apos;ve been asked to not do this anymore .
I &apos;m thirty now .
Tom &apos;s daughter is sick .
I &apos;ve got a wife and three children .
I never want to leave here .
I wish you &apos;d said that before .
Where is my office ?
Tom did exactly as he was told .
Why does Tom do that ?
There must be something else to drink .
That is exactly what I wanted to buy .
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
Tom knows that Mary likes him .
Can you see the picture ?
No one knew about it .
You &apos;d better not go there .
Does she have children ?
Nobody came to the party .
Tom had fun with it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to get married .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is busy or not .
I was a little early .
This is the last time I &apos;ll ask you to do anything for me .
What kind of house does Tom live in ?
My father is home .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
I wish things were the way they used to be .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
Don &apos;t do this again .
It seems like we have to go now .
Do you know how to get to our place ?
You know what it is , don &apos;t you ?
What do you think about the book ?
You can go home now .
Tom must be rich .
I have to talk to Tom .
Tom was very sick .
Tom is at home , isn &apos;t he ?
I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
He has been playing tennis since this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
Tom went to Boston by car .
I &apos;ll take your word on that .
Tom said this to me .
How did you like the party ?
I &apos;m really rich .
There &apos;s no one in the house . They &apos;re all outside .
I heard that he was very rich .
I know the whole story .
It &apos;s time to go home .
I have to go to the doctor today .
Mary doesn &apos;t look like her mother .
Is there some reason why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
This is our friend Tom .
I can &apos;t study at home .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Tom still didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to go .
I &apos;ve got something I want to show you .
He had a book in his hand .
I do not know when she can come .
She asked how his father was .
I think I &apos;ve done well .
Tom has been sick for a long time .
I have to think of my children .
Do you have a family ?
That &apos;s up to Tom .
Where did you hear that story ?
I didn &apos;t even know you had a girlfriend .
We don &apos;t want this one .
This is good , isn &apos;t it ?
I can &apos;t live in this house anymore .
Tom has a house in Boston .
Tom and Mary are going to get married .
We go to school by bus .
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like being told he &apos;s not old enough yet .
It &apos;s too long .
What do you do after dinner ?
We shouldn &apos;t have done this .
How long are you in town , Tom ?
They are both good students .
Tom wants more coffee .
I &apos;ll be back later today .
I know exactly what needs to be done .
That &apos;s a great plan .
I told you it was too soon .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t want it .
Tom didn &apos;t ask me to do anything .
All of us are happy .
Why don &apos;t I have a girlfriend ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
I almost feel bad for Tom .
Tom was outside .
Tom said Mary is fine .
I know what they &apos;re like .
I &apos;d like to be like Tom .
Why can &apos;t we just be friends ?
I couldn &apos;t sleep all night .
Do you want to go there ?
I have to see this movie .
If you want to stay , you may .
Is Tom one of your friends ?
He speaks too fast .
I don &apos;t want to say anything .
This is our home .
All the students forgot to read that book .
Tom had nothing to do with it .
I want to hear it from you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where it is .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about what other people think .
Do you know why Tom isn &apos;t here ?
Tom must have seen something .
Why isn &apos;t Tom in the car ?
I don &apos;t understand this word .
Tom knows something I don &apos;t .
When did you come to Japan ?
How long do you have ?
I no longer love you .
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
I don &apos;t have anything to give to you .
Are you a student ?
It &apos;s up to you and me .
Tom won &apos;t help .
My father &apos;s a doctor .
That book is mine .
I &apos;m going to Australia .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
He asked me whether I was busy .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like John .
I said I &apos;d get it .
You have to go home .
It was yesterday that I met her .
The car doesn &apos;t run fast .
We want to help .
My mother made me what I am today .
Tom and I often play tennis together .
I &apos;m coming back .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything yet .
We &apos;re going to do that .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Boston .
It is Monday today .
Tom knows what that is .
You should &apos;ve seen the movie .
I &apos;ll see you later .
She &apos;s still young .
I &apos;ll study French , too .
I like English better .
Tom couldn &apos;t see anything .
Why do you want to help the police ?
I heard everything .
I said everything I had to say .
Tom says this is what he really needs .
I &apos;m very happy for you .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I hope that she &apos;ll get well soon .
Would you like to know who did that ?
The cat seems to want some water .
The dog seems sick .
The time has come .
When did the accident happen ?
Can you help me , please ?
Tom probably won &apos;t come .
Do you know what I want ?
I feel very sick .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live here anymore .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the reason .
You know where to find me if you need anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
What time is your bus ?
There are still people who don &apos;t know how to read .
Tom wanted to talk to you .
I want much more .
This is still not good enough .
No one comes to visit me anymore .
You should eat something before you go .
He is very fast .
I had fun .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t here .
Tom and I are going to be there .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
I hope Tom is right .
She can speak French .
Can we try this again ?
Tom says he won &apos;t come .
It wasn &apos;t my idea .
The book was better than the movie .
We don &apos;t do that .
I know that it &apos;s difficult .
He has a few friends .
I know I &apos;m right .
Tom won &apos;t have time to do that .
They didn &apos;t tell me so .
I know that you &apos;ve been waiting for this .
I &apos;ll do as you say .
Mary can &apos;t have any more children .
I &apos;m really sorry about that .
I know that Tom was right .
Tom will wait .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet .
I didn &apos;t think it would be that easy .
I saw Tom tonight .
What does Tom want to know ?
Tom would just like to talk .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be with us .
She tried .
My mother is in the hospital now .
Come soon .
Tom wants to read a book .
I will give you this book .
What happened in Boston ?
Tom made coffee .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in years .
I wish I &apos;d met her .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Don &apos;t give me that .
This was my mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t even know that Mary was gone .
I don &apos;t have it with me .
Let &apos;s have dinner .
I know Tom &apos;s sister .
Tom knows that he needs to do something , but he &apos;s not sure what .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
She hasn &apos;t come yet .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom could speak French .
He is nothing but a child .
Tom saw nothing .
What does Tom want me to do ?
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
