Don &apos;t say such things .
Have you finished your coffee ?
I think I &apos;m going to throw up .
Use your fist .
Mary is wearing some sexy clothes .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t a student anymore .
Tom likes to be here .
He was elected governor of Texas in 1994 .
I &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t invited .
How long will you be staying with us ?
Tom sounds upset .
Tom told me Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
Tom used to play football before he got married .
No matter how much she eats , she never gains weight .
Tom is fair .
If you &apos;d prefer , we can speak French .
Tom didn &apos;t even have the decency to wait for me to finish talking .
He asked his teacher for advice .
He can play a flute .
Tom and Mary have become very good friends .
I can &apos;t remember what question I asked him .
They asked me for something to drink .
Would you like any dessert ?
I &apos;ll put some coffee on .
On the days he doesn &apos;t take a nap , he &apos;s bad tempered .
I think we need to find out why Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
I &apos;m running out of ideas .
Do you dream in French ?
Tom lives on the same street as Mary .
Tom walked down the hall alone .
You could ask Tom .
I know that Mary loves me .
When do you want to do this ?

Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
It is more blessed to give than to receive .
Tom is an expert on the subject .
Is Tom over there with you ?
I don &apos;t think this armchair is comfortable .
I have plenty of time , but not enough money .
The kidnapper told me he &apos;d kill Tom if I didn &apos;t show up alone .
Tom vacuumed the carpet .
Stop biting your nails .
One minute has sixty seconds .
In 1860 , Lincoln was elected President of the United States .
I &apos;ll see if I can help .
I &apos;m glad of that .
How well can you play tennis ?
Tom didn &apos;t object .
He &apos;s quite a nice fellow but I don &apos;t like him .
Did you really expect him to tell you the truth ?
That castle was built in ancient times .
Suddenly , I blacked out .
Whenever Tom comes to Boston , he stays with us .
I can &apos;t ever be with you .
Where do you live , Tom ?
I &apos;ve got a wife and three children .
Let &apos;s try another approach to the matter .
How many foreign languages do you speak ?
Tom threw something at me and I ducked .
Turn to the right , and you &apos;ll find my office .
I &apos;ve enjoyed reading this novel .
He was disciplined for his wrongdoing .

I think we need to find out where Tom is .
My grandfather lived to be ninety .
The apples from the tree behind Tom &apos;s house are very delicious .
Tom is also an artist .
I &apos;d like to ask Tom a few questions if I may .
It &apos;s junk . Throw it away .
I helped Tom move his desk .
Tom divorced Mary .
This happened before .
Can &apos;t you see why we &apos;re suspicious ?
We need to work together in order to make the world a better place .
Are you telling me how to do my job ?
I don &apos;t want to go to the pool .
She had a bad tooth taken out .
He turned a somersault .
It seemed that she had already received the money .

The speed with which we forget is just unbelievable .

Tom is going to survive .
In California , most houses have frames of wood .
He ran and ran , but could not catch up with his dog .

It wouldn &apos;t surprise me .
How did you hit upon such an idea ?
Tom works from early in the morning until late at night every day .
Tom sits behind Mary in French class .
Is he going to make it ?
Are you going by bus or car ?
What time do you put your son to bed ?
I &apos;m very cold .
I thought I could do it .
I was discouraged .
I &apos;m glad to be here .
I saw a boy swimming across the river .
I can &apos;t let Tom do that .
Mary had never worn a sari before .
The train lurched to a standstill .
Tom is throwing stones at birds .
No one was late .
Tom knows what you said .
It &apos;ll take some time to get used to living here .
Tom is on night duty tonight .
Since when do you care about what I think ?
Does anyone else use your account ?
OK , listen up .
We went as far as Kyoto .
The box was too heavy for him to lift .
The war began three years later .
Maybe I &apos;ve been too hard on Tom .

Tom has a voracious appetite .
We all held our breath while we watched it .
He is always neatly dressed .
He was absent from class .
I accept this proposal .
I &apos;m still working on it .
I &apos;ve seen people doing that .
Tom &apos;s upset .
We happened to be on the same train .
Pass me the salt , please .
You seem happy to me .
He runs fast .
This desk is good .
Don &apos;t harm them .
Tom never talks about money .
As soon as I find it , I &apos;ll bring it over to your place .
Have you ever been bitten by your dog ?
Tom isn &apos;t tidy .
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
Tom promised not to tell .
I &apos;m sure Tom will like the gift you got him .
How to deal with environmental pollution is a serious matter .
Tom said that I needed to put on some sunscreen .
That &apos;s the painter whose picture you want to buy .
Why are you going ?
If you have a fever , it would be a good idea to go to the hospital right away .
Do you want me to put this on the table ?
He retired to his own room after supper .
Those are my trousers .
That &apos;s my umbrella , not Tom &apos;s .
He is always kind to animals .
It &apos;s about two miles .
The company plans to sell the new product for $ 1,000 .
There &apos;s a big hole in your sock .
As for myself , Saturday will be convenient .

Oh , take your time . I &apos;m in no hurry .
I hope the economy picks up soon .
He won &apos;t pass the test .
Tom grows rice .
I &apos;m surprised you and Tom don &apos;t like each other .
Most people like pizza .
I &apos;ll talk .
Could you drop me at the bus station ?
You aren &apos;t rich , are you ?
Mary has a huge doll collection .
You really have to manage him carefully .
Their carpet is completely white .
Tom must &apos;ve known that would happen .
Tom never says hi to me .
Is tomorrow Saturday ?
Covered with dust , the doll stood in the corner of the room .
The roses in my garden are beautiful .
You &apos;re confusing me .
Tom is now in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound .
I &apos;m not making it up .
Have a nice holiday .
Do we have to go there ?
Tom has a theory about why this happens .
He had his secretary type the report .
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
Tom knows how to swim .
Do you want to see Tom again ?
You may invite anyone you like .

Don &apos;t worry about such a trivial problem .
He had the right idea .
Tom felt guilty .

The doctors don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Follow that car .
I found her kind .
Tom and Mary always speak to each other in French .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Bring me my shoes .
Tom was overjoyed .
Tom usually eats his lunch alone .
Make sure that nobody enters .
Tom knocked again .
Tom asked Mary to help him organize the party .
His mother sighed with relief .
I am listening to country music .
He is not as smart as his older brother .
It &apos;s so hard to choose .
Whose is all this money ?
Numerous stars were visible in the sky .
Tom sleeps with his window open .
Tom is extinguishing the fire .
I went downstairs to get some milk and cookies .
I &apos;m afraid she won &apos;t accept my explanation .
I haven &apos;t told him anything .
We have a lot more food than we need .
When was the last time you cut your nails ?
Tom is sitting at his desk .
Why do you think I &apos;m thinking about you ?
I would do it again .
It began raining just now .
It &apos;s a win-win situation .
Politics didn &apos;t interest him .
It is a great pleasure to be here .
Tom is grotesque .
The train came to a smooth stop .
You &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
They said I wasn &apos;t qualified for the job .
That &apos;s how Tom makes his living .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary .
How did you get those ?
It &apos;s a Spanish book .
There &apos;s a hole in this sock .
He saved himself somehow .

It &apos;s all over .
Tom denied having been involved in the affair .
Do you sell formal wear ?
I feel better every day .
Tom walks .
She took me under her wing and taught me everything she knows .
Tom took me to a nice restaurant .
Can you justify your action ?
I &apos;ll get one .
We have very little time .
I &apos;ll leave the second or third of next month .
You need me more than I need you .
Tom is about a head taller than me .
Did you wait for Tom ?
I was truly perplexed .
It depends on how you deal with it .
He angrily tore up the letter from her .
You &apos;re generous .
I &apos;m surprised at your behavior .
That &apos;s so juvenile .
Happiness is a delicate flower .
We should take a break .
Go to your room and wait there until I call you .
It takes you an hour to go to the station on foot .
Anybody can do that .
We were all exhausted .
Can you continue ?
She came to Tokyo when she was eighteen years old .
Do you know when Tom got his driver &apos;s license ?
This bookcase is easy to assemble .
India is the seventh largest country in the world .
I walked my dog .
Too bad you have to leave already .
I &apos;m sorry , I dialed the wrong number .
This is the tricky part .
Stand up and introduce yourself , please .
The boy put his hands in his pockets .
I live with my parents .
Stop messing around .
I invited my neighbors to dinner .
We &apos;ve been trying to keep it a secret .
Tom sat two rows ahead of me .
She can &apos;t cook well .
You have betrayed us .
There are few bookstores in this area .
Tom got a job as a waiter .
Tom put his hand on his heart .
A book worth reading is worth reading twice .
What do you call this ?
Get Tom out of there .
Tom likes Swiss cheese .
We should &apos;ve bought three bottles of wine .
Who &apos;re you looking for ?
We can offer these new products at 20 % below list price .
It is wrong to tell a lie .
The workers are striking for better pay .
Would it be possible to change my reservation now ?
This is an amazing offer .
He gave me a nice Christmas present .
It &apos;s raining , but I would like to go out .
Is it Tuesday already ?
You must be here by five .
He gave in .
The report cannot be true .
Tom insisted on paying the bill .
Tom waited an hour in the hallway outside Mary &apos;s apartment .
He made it for his sister .
Forty-eight sailors are on board .
Tom runs very fast .
He applied for the job and got it .
We met at two in the afternoon .
There were just barely over 100 houses in the village we passed yesterday .
Can you at least pretend you &apos;re enjoying yourself ?
The airport is in Osaka Bay .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t either .
Tom finally did something right .
We had lunch in the meeting room .
I have better things to do than sit around all day waiting for Tom .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t speak to John .
I &apos;m expecting .
We lived in Australia for three years before we came to New Zealand .
I got an A .
Go wake Tom up and tell him breakfast is ready .
I need Tom &apos;s help .
That &apos;s just what I need right now .
Tom is going to study French next year .
Tom passed a glass of milk to Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working in the garden .
You can &apos;t still be mad at me .
Where are the strawberries ?
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston .
Tom put the turkey in the oven .
He nodded to me .
You should consider moving to Boston .
I &apos;ll stand by you no matter what happens .
Tom wants to try it .
I persuaded my mother to lend me her car .
Did you steal it ?
Tom definitely needs some time off .
As a matter of fact , he did it by himself .
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Tom was out of control .
Tom hesitated before answering .
The man fell in love at first sight .
Tom kept looking at you . Didn &apos;t you notice ?
Is everything you own in that chest ?
I don &apos;t remember that at all .
I &apos;m almost thirty years old and I &apos;m still single .
I &apos;m pleased to finally meet you .
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one .
Tom ran back into his apartment .
I major in economics .
We &apos;d like to confirm our reservations .
Tom poured himself another scotch .
It doesn &apos;t really make much sense , does it ?
Tom is mad at Mary .
I like to take my children to the beach .
Let me help you with that .
Japan has a lot of beautiful mountains .
We &apos;re looking forward to that .
I enjoy the time we spend together .
I don &apos;t like these kind of jokes .
Achille was born in Paris in 1908 .
Can we go somewhere and talk ?
What do you have in mind ?
Go home .
Are you absolutely sure ?
He came to my rescue .
Tom seemed happy .
Tom is smashed .
Tom and Mary look good together .
Tom is memorizing a poem .
Where is the Spanish embassy ?
Yesterday , Mary cleaned the house and washed clothes .
May I suggest another solution ?
Tom said he had to go somewhere .
When is dinner served ?
I &apos;ll handle everything .
Tom said he can &apos;t eat that much food by himself .
Tom used the new knife Mary had given him to cut the vegetables .
Tom didn &apos;t say who he &apos;d gone with .
You don &apos;t need to finish it by tomorrow .
It &apos;s a bit intimidating .
The birds flapped their wings .
How &apos;s your little sister ?
I said good night to my parents and went to bed .
Are these ours ?
The price includes tax .
Tom put the ring on Mary &apos;s finger .
I don &apos;t know who you are and I don &apos;t care .
Can you help me find out ?
You should marry someone you love .
I managed to make myself understood in French .
I speak from experience .
I knew something like this was going to happen .
I &apos;m not an early riser .
Are they busy ?
See if the gas is turned off .
My wife looked surprised .
Don &apos;t disappoint me , Tom .
Tom wants to become a fireman .
I know Tom isn &apos;t an idiot .
This is my sister .
I hope he &apos;ll get better soon .
Tom thought he had a chance to make a lot of money on the stock market .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary at all .
That man is skinny , but his wife is fat .
It &apos;s just over there .
&quot; I can &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; Me neither . &quot;
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off .
I regret not having studied harder at school .
I suspect that Tom is the one who stole the money .
She has a lot of friends here .
How do you know about this ?
I don &apos;t do it anymore .
I wear jeans almost every day .
