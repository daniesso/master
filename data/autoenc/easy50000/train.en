Don &apos;t you have anything else ?
Tom has a son not much older than Mary .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see that .
I laughed so hard I cried .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary went to Boston .
Is her father a teacher ?
Tom hasn &apos;t written to Mary in a long time .
Tom got very confused .
In a few years , we &apos;ll all be doing that .
I &apos;ve got to speak to you .
Tom threw Mary the ball .
Tom came home from school earlier than usual .
Are you alone ?
All of us like her .
What would you do if you failed ?
Tom went to Boston at the end of October .
I sat down on the sofa next to Tom .
I don &apos;t like to be alone .
What are you drinking ?
How can I explain this ?
Get back here .
Tom didn &apos;t have the time .
She tried not to cry .
Tom knows what &apos;s going on .
He will look after the cats for me while I &apos;m abroad .
Why do you want to buy this book ?
We were reading a book and it was a very good one .
He knows how to help people .
He sometimes eats lunch there , too .
I don &apos;t have a very good dictionary .
That &apos;s what you told me .
Is this it ?
Tom is old enough to drive .
Everything is going too fast .
They &apos;ll know what to do .
What do Tom and Mary look like ?
I &apos;m going back home for Christmas .
I had to talk to Tom .
I have a lot of friends .
Do you study French every day ?
It is difficult for me to understand him .
You must clean your room .
We are with you .
I &apos;m now learning how to do that .
I wish somebody would help me do that .
Tom isn &apos;t as good at French as you think he is .
I don &apos;t quite believe what he says .
I think it won &apos;t be a problem .
Tom says that he &apos;s still hungry .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the difference between right and wrong .
Are they all the same ?
She doesn &apos;t live with him .
Tom probably knows more than he &apos;s telling us .
I &apos;ve said too much already .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you come or not .
Tom thought Mary was in Boston .
I had the feeling that something wasn &apos;t right .
Excuse me . Who are you ?
The bus will take time .
They went there .
I don &apos;t know what to think of this .
What kind of a camera do you have ?
We know it &apos;s you .
It was summer and the weather was warm .
I would like you to come with me .
I don &apos;t want to be friends with you .
I said I &apos;d go .
I &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
I didn &apos;t know Mary and Alice were sisters .
What &apos;s this street called ?
I can &apos;t talk to women .
I can &apos;t believe it either .
He stopped smoking .
Tom is ill .
I don &apos;t often come to Boston .
Can I go first ?
I know things you don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll get there in an hour .
I do agree with Tom .
Tom sounds nervous .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I can &apos;t find my bag .
I like it here .
The ship was at sea .
Could I see you for a moment ?
It has suddenly gotten cold , hasn &apos;t it ?
What my mother had said was true .
I asked him what his name was .
Where can I find Tom ?
No one was killed in the fire .
I had no other choice .
They &apos;re too big .
You talk fast .
Do as you want .
I &apos;d like to see them again .
I knew Tom couldn &apos;t win .
You don &apos;t believe Tom , do you ?
I never knew Tom could speak French .
I loved her .
Please tell me what this is .
I hear you , but I don &apos;t see you .
I might work in Boston next year .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s real .
Tom had his camera stolen .
Do you have any questions for me ?
Tom really drinks too much .
The hotel is down there .
If Tom can &apos;t tell me , then no one can .
How many people are on the list now ?
Tom refused to talk about it .
I don &apos;t believe I &apos;ve heard that name .
Tom would have eaten more if he hadn &apos;t been sick .
The room was warm .
I tried again and again .
I &apos;d be willing to do that .
We &apos;re going to wait in the car .
What language do you use when you talk with your parents ?
Maybe we shouldn &apos;t have gotten married .
Tom and Mary sat across from John and Alice .
She killed him with a knife .
I &apos;ll give you a ride home .
I had a good idea .
If you want to be alone , I &apos;ll leave .
I wrote this book .
I said that I didn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom was sitting in that chair over there this morning .
Would you mind not smoking in this room ?
Tom is now on his own .
Everybody knows .
The problem has more to do with you than with me .
Do your very best .
He looked very happy .
If only I had a pretty dress like that !
I no longer want that .
Tom showed me how to make pizza .
Let &apos;s play this game again .
At one time , there was a bridge here .
Tom should &apos;ve been back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ll always love you . No matter what .
I am really pleased with my new car .
Does Tom have to do that , too ?
The key is on the desk .
We don &apos;t know what Tom said .
I should &apos;ve done that sooner .
Why is Tom still awake ?
Tom broke up with Mary today .
She must have done it yesterday .
It &apos;s going to be hard to do that without a lot of help .
Tom used to drink a lot .
The radio died .
Tom often goes to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a TV at home .
I was surprised Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
Tom has worked for me for three years .
I was sent home .
He has never been late for school .
We can &apos;t let Tom walk . Let &apos;s give him a ride .
You &apos;re very nice .
That &apos;s not the problem .
We want Tom to go home .
Why are your eyes so big ?
Tom never drinks beer .
Tom will be thirty this year .
Tom came to me for help .
Tom isn &apos;t the type of person I want working for us .
Tom knew that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
Did Tom hurt you ?
Everybody &apos;s tired .
There &apos;s so much left for me to learn .
Here &apos;s your desk .
There &apos;s nothing I want to say to you .
She is eight .
I have three children .
Tom probably got home last Monday .
Tom and I often eat lunch together .
Is Tom going to live ?
We spent the weekend with friends .
Who else was at Tom &apos;s party ?
Tom has started studying French again .
How did you find out Tom didn &apos;t need to do that ?
I wondered whether or not Tom wanted to sing .
I &apos;ll stay here as long as I can .
It &apos;s all quite simple .
You convinced me .
Tom looked lonely .
How &apos;s your day going ?
In any case , you don &apos;t need to worry .
We live together .
Tom isn &apos;t going to drive the children to school tomorrow .
Do you know what that is ?
Have you found something ?
Tom &apos;s not happy with that .
What did they have to say ?
Are you going to see Tom again ?
Take it easy !
I don &apos;t know if it is true .
They swim very quickly .
I will do as you say .
What are you up to this weekend ?
Did Tom eat this morning ?
Do you really think that Tom will be able to help Mary ?
You can still swim quite well , can &apos;t you ?
Will you lend me your dictionary ?
I can &apos;t discuss it .
They have to go to school .
He doesn &apos;t know any of us .
How did Tom know that Mary wouldn &apos;t be here ?
I know I have a lot to learn .
It &apos;ll be really lonely without you .
Have you forgotten everything we &apos;ve done for you ?
How is the weather today ?
That &apos;s not how it works .
I &apos;d have come if you &apos;d invited me .
Tom is trying to help you .
I don &apos;t have anyone waiting for me at home .
I need coffee .
I know what you are thinking .
She watched him swim .
Tom was fast asleep .
You &apos;re in great danger .
They &apos;re as tired as we are .
I can &apos;t see well .
Do you know where the money is ?
Tom found nothing .
We didn &apos;t go to Boston .
We don &apos;t want Tom to do that anymore .
There is a dog on the bridge .
I have a problem with my car .
I want to do this for Tom .
She is having lunch now .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
I want to learn a new language .
I didn &apos;t know how to do it , but I was willing to give it a try .
I &apos;ve lived in Boston a little over three years .
What happened to your car ?
They don &apos;t like cats .
I might see Tom tomorrow .
She &apos;s better at it than I am .
I am going to do it .
He had nothing to do with the case .
He played the guitar and she played the piano .
Don &apos;t be angry with me .
English is not easy for me .
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow .
My car &apos;s over there .
Tom needs water .
Tom killed Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told me what to do .
I think there &apos;s something wrong here .
We &apos;ve already decided not to do that .
Can I sleep here ?
What makes you think I want this ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have enough time .
I &apos;ll make you happy no matter what happens .
I didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
Do you think I &apos;ll get the bike ?
It was very difficult to convince Tom .
It &apos;ll rain in the afternoon .
I want you to stop singing .
I &apos;m not telling you his name .
I &apos;m old enough to be your father .
Tom and Mary look very happy together .
Tom took Mary home .
I &apos;ve got more .
I &apos;m going to do that .
He &apos;s in the kitchen .
My plan is different from yours .
This actually happened to me .
That &apos;s not the case .
How do you take your coffee ?
I go to the movies once a month .
What are you guys going to play ?
Is Tom with us ?
The teacher was disappointed at my answer .
I believe you know what I mean .
I want you to be by my side .
I wish I could give up smoking .
I can hardly wait .
Tom went with Mary to Boston .
I go to church .
A policeman came up to me .
I saw Tom three hours ago .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
Where &apos;s your car ?
I &apos;d rather not talk about it .
Tom is going to take you home .
Who &apos;s that girl ?
I stopped asking questions .
We can &apos;t lose .
Let &apos;s not study French today .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
I &apos;m going to be fine .
We &apos;ll see each other again .
Was that you on TV last night ?
Don &apos;t you ever let me hear you talking to your mother like that again .
No one can help you .
I don &apos;t intend to let Tom drive .
I &apos;m very proud of Tom .
Where &apos;s Tom gone ?
Isn &apos;t it about time to go home ?
I saw Tom this morning .
Tom looks like he &apos;s a bit tired .
Let &apos;s get married .
Tom plays the guitar very well .
How long do I have ?
I don &apos;t really want to stop .
That &apos;s how he likes it .
We &apos;re going to Boston for a week .
Tom is having coffee now .
Tom doesn &apos;t get this .
Why do you have to do it ?
You &apos;ve got to go home .
I didn &apos;t think it could happen to me .
You are twice as strong as me .
You &apos;ll do fine , Tom .
I didn &apos;t write that .
Tom speaks French better than me .
Is that your boyfriend ?
How do you know about Tom ?
That &apos;s not what he said .
If I &apos;d wanted to go , I would &apos;ve said so .
I &apos;ve seen you doing that .
Tom opened the door and held it open for Mary .
She also speaks French .
The train arrived at the station on time .
I don &apos;t know if Tom is dead or alive .
Why didn &apos;t you guys tell me ?
I was already married at your age .
Don &apos;t open this door , please .
Is this the train for London ?
It &apos;s not my decision .
Tom is nice .
I &apos;d leave .
We don &apos;t have anything to eat .
What color was Tom wearing ?
They &apos;re not like us .
I like her . She &apos;s so beautiful !
There &apos;s nothing I like more than swimming .
What did I just do ?
We saw them leave .
The paper is under the table .
Tom will probably be absent tomorrow .
Don &apos;t go out with Tom .
I never said that .
My speech will only be about three minutes long .
Everyone here is named Tom .
Tom got married three years ago .
Tom got paid today .
Tom lives near here .
Tom is not one of us .
I don &apos;t have much time now .
Tom never talks about money .
I visited Tom in Boston three years ago .
What &apos;re they up to ?
We &apos;re awake .
It is not his business .
I think that &apos;s for Tom to decide .
He was never to see her again .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe how cute Mary was .
What does he see ?
Do you want to go out on a date with Tom ?
That &apos;s what you have to do .
How much did you pay for that ?
Did you understand me ?
I used to play with my sister in the park .
I &apos;m learning English .
I can &apos;t find my keys .
What do you want from us ?
Did you sleep well ?
If you tell Tom what to do , I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do it .
He found his key and opened the door .
Would you like to dance ?
They won &apos;t make it .
She cried for help , but nobody heard her .
Maybe he was ill .
What are we doing out here ?
Do you know what it is ?
How much is this clock ?
Tom does want to do that .
I love you , too .
Tom is in Boston now .
Can you meet me at my office at 2 : 30 ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is right .
Stop laughing .
This book is for you .
We &apos;ll take it .
Tom is still outside .
I expected you home three hours ago .
Bring your sister next time .
Come and see me soon .
I don &apos;t need a boyfriend .
I cannot afford to pay so much .
I know the solution .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t from Boston ?
I don &apos;t speak French as well as I want to .
I wasn &apos;t too sure about it .
She told me she knew my brother .
I &apos;m not hungry right now .
I gave my word .
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says .
I think that everybody knows .
He &apos;s really into soccer .
Why do we have to do it ?
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for you .
I &apos;ve always known that .
Did Tom stay long ?
They didn &apos;t find Tom .
What does that word mean ?
I &apos;ve told Tom everything .
The law is the law .
I think we can get everything we need .
Tom seems to be honest .
Here &apos;s your beer .
Tom isn &apos;t like me .
That &apos;s the question we have to solve .
I do not have much time .
Try harder tomorrow .
Tom walked over to the desk .
Tom does study a lot .
How many people are you expecting ?
Tom listened to what Mary was saying .
I &apos;ll do what I want .
Tom wants to learn how to play guitar .
What did they tell you ?
I think you know I like you .
I &apos;m not going out because I have to do my homework .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
How do you think Tom is doing ?
The train was almost empty .
Have you ever sold a car ?
She asked him questions .
We need a car .
I told Mary that I just wanted to be friends .
I &apos;m coming back .
How can you say something like that ?
I &apos;ll miss Tom , too .
The question is who &apos;ll do it .
We &apos;re good to go .
Tom won &apos;t lose .
You cannot do all these things at once .
Tom has enough money to buy any computer in this store . He just needs to decide which one .
I need to get back home now .
I &apos;m not your enemy .
Tom took off .
Take it away .
I am happy to spend money on books .
Tom isn &apos;t helping .
She looked happy in her new dress .
What is truth ?
I went on reading .
Children learn languages very quickly .
We &apos;re not going , are we ?
I didn &apos;t want to let Tom into my house .
I do not play the piano .
Tom is back in town .
What &apos;s the point of not eating ?
Tom got up at six almost every day .
Tom is really late .
Is my explanation clear ?
Americans eat a lot of meat .
Tom is down there .
I really don &apos;t like Tom .
I &apos;m very sorry about Tom .
Tom and I want you to come with us .
Tom is a little over thirty .
Did Tom see that ?
Tom broke it .
We live in Boston .
I &apos;ll never doubt you again .
There is a letter for you .
Here is a letter for you .
Tom is far away .
You know Tom doesn &apos;t like that .
I think his life is in danger .
Is that too difficult ?
Tom is the man of the house .
I think I &apos;m in love with you .
It &apos;s still mine .
When I grow up , I want to be just like my father .
Don &apos;t give up on love .
He took a walk before breakfast .
If you think that &apos;s necessary , you should do it .
Is there anything I must do ?
It made me very happy .
If you wish , I &apos;ll ask .
Why do you have your umbrella up ? It &apos;s not raining .
I saw a dog swim across the river .
Tom took his shirt off .
You &apos;d better get going .
Tom can &apos;t speak French well .
This isn &apos;t the only key .
I want to want what you want .
This needs to change .
I have an idea what it is .
You don &apos;t want to tell me why , do you ?
Tom is really busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
No one was in the car .
Tom isn &apos;t a good teacher .
We &apos;ll try .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to do that .
I &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t bring Tom along .
If I tell my mother , she &apos;ll worry , so I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll tell her .
There is no person to do it .
Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa , watching TV .
Tom might hear you .
They say Tom can do that .
Tom said John is a good man .
Don &apos;t forget your stuff .
I wish I knew where he was !
Everybody is waiting for you .
Tom said he knew Mary .
Tom died in prison .
Tom will come tomorrow .
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
I can talk about anything with my best friend .
I have to stop doing this .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do it .
I know that Tom was at your house today .
I &apos;d think you &apos;d understand .
Tom works eight hours a day .
Tom means nothing to me .
Tom seems to be angry .
Since there was nothing left to do , we left .
I do like you .
Tom isn &apos;t the only one .
Can someone explain this to me ?
I &apos;ve got some things to take care of .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without saying anything .
Tom made his mother happy .
He &apos;s not sure he &apos;s ready .
Tom broke his promise .
She showed me the present that she had received from her boyfriend .
The old man sat all alone .
I never want to see your face again .
I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question .
You always were good at your job .
Tom has lived in Australia for over thirty years .
Tom didn &apos;t think Mary could fix his watch .
Is Tom doing better ?
I &apos;ve heard quite a lot about you .
I think that my mom knows .
I &apos;ve never been better .
You haven &apos;t paid me yet .
What is it you like about Tom ?
I don &apos;t feel like playing either .
Tom is seldom late for school .
Do you have some wine ?
I &apos;ve been to the bank .
Have you ever done it ?
Did you ask Tom why ?
I have nothing to do today .
It &apos;s cold out here .
We were just about to leave .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s grandmother .
Tom should &apos;ve won .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it here .
I &apos;ll call him tonight .
Did Tom see anything ?
You know I would never hurt you .
I &apos;m really glad you decided to come .
You had better not drive a car .
If I had known about it , I would have changed my plan .
What have you learned about Tom ?
What language do you usually use when talking with Tom ?
It &apos;s probably Tom .
We don &apos;t have sugar .
We &apos;re coming in .
I don &apos;t ever want to see Tom again .
Is your watch correct ?
Was Tom asleep ?
Tom took Mary by the arm .
Everyone knows that he &apos;s still alive .
My sister died last year .
I should tell Tom the truth .
Are you from Boston , too ?
Please leave me alone .
Is Tom in love with you ?
Tom thought Mary knew John .
I can &apos;t talk to you here . It &apos;s too dangerous .
It seems interesting to me .
I was told to stay on the ship .
Give me your money .
&quot; We &apos;d like a beer . &quot; &quot; Just one beer ? &quot;
Tom might be Canadian .
Where did you eat last night ?
They &apos;ll come looking for Tom .
Tom smiled for the camera .
Would you like me to call a taxi ?
She wanted to get married immediately .
I am thinking about my children .
Thank you for coming , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what that is .
Is the bridge safe ?
Tom asked Mary to explain it .
I have no one to blame but myself .
It wasn &apos;t difficult to understand .
It &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
I hope he hasn &apos;t had an accident .
I don &apos;t remember when and where I met you .
There is a woman who wants to see you .
Tom would tell us the truth , wouldn &apos;t he ?
Let me have a try at it .
I want you to know that .
They just left .
He is too shy to talk to girls .
Is there anything you want to tell me ?
There is a cat .
I have the feeling that I &apos;ve seen these shoes somewhere before .
I cannot stop her .
Tom couldn &apos;t see Mary .
I can &apos;t get that out of my mind .
I &apos;ll be on time .
She was very happy with my gift .
Tom stole Mary &apos;s computer .
I &apos;ve never had that problem before .
Are they alive ?
This coat is nice , but too expensive .
Tom is never satisfied .
Tom had the whole house to himself .
It turned out to be true .
You don &apos;t have to answer this question .
There was not a tree in sight .
I &apos;ll handle everything .
What do you want to eat for lunch ?
Tom helped a lot .
You don &apos;t have to talk to me if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom should really do that .
Who &apos;s your teacher ?
Thank you for coming early .
Tom is much better today than he was yesterday .
Are you sure ?
Your uncle and I have known each other for many years .
What else did you do together ?
Please wait here for Tom .
I &apos;m almost sure .
What did Tom bring ?
I want to give up .
You &apos;ve just got to try harder .
I dropped my keys .
Tom probably isn &apos;t mad at you anymore .
Isn &apos;t that what they want ?
Do you have it with you ?
Is there anything else I should know about Tom ?
I &apos;ll eat after that .
I &apos;m going to tell you the truth .
Can you help me find my daughter ?
Tom looks like his mother .
I let go of Tom &apos;s hand .
Tell Tom that I need to talk to him .
That &apos;s never happened to us before .
I &apos;d like to be a teacher .
He told me that he would see it once more .
Tom put his coat back on .
Tom plays the guitar better than anyone else I know .
Tom knows how to drive a car .
I &apos;m in Boston .
I guess that &apos;s good .
Tom will be happy .
Tom talks a lot about his father .
Tom knows the rules .
That &apos;s kind of you , Tom .
Do you think you know me ?
Are you ready to go out ?
It &apos;s very kind of you to help me with my homework .
I like your shirt .
Tom &apos;ll go .
Don &apos;t go in my room .
How much is this umbrella ?
My dream is to go to Japan .
He will visit his uncle .
I think you &apos;d like it there .
Please write what you said .
I want a job .
Do you really want me to give your computer to Tom ?
I know the girl .
Can I talk to you ?
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Tom laughed again .
Give me your money !
Let me know if you need help .
What happened to the others ?
I will have to work on Sunday .
Go to bed .
I left the house .
I have no homework today .
She looked him in the face .
I can understand Tom .
How often do you see him ?
I &apos;m sorry that I haven &apos;t been able to be here for you .
Tom pretended to be angry .
We &apos;re in danger .
My brother &apos;s name is Tom .
There is a desk in this room .
He doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
We can speak French .
She bought him a dog .
I don &apos;t like to work .
I have done what I could .
Can I talk to you for a second please ?
Tom and Mary did their homework together .
Tom thinks that &apos;s not a good idea .
He can &apos;t stay long .
Tom speaks French as well as I do .
I think it &apos;s the best way .
Tom loves you . I know he does .
I didn &apos;t intend to say that .
She was very proud of her father .
Why did you decide to speak about that now ?
We can &apos;t go right now .
She wants him to be just a friend .
Tom looks like he wants to say something .
Where are you going to go ?
I like Boston .
Tom left Australia a few months ago .
It was yesterday that she went .
That &apos;s for you to do .
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
My father is busy .
The girl sitting at the piano is my daughter .
Be quiet for a second .
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself .
Tom looks rich .
Here &apos;s what we want .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe you or not .
Is it new ?
You &apos;ve probably forgotten about it already .
Let &apos;s start here .
Tom can help us do that next week .
Do you want to know ?
Tom tried to convince Mary that he &apos;d changed .
I &apos;m just a teacher .
Tom is angry with us .
Tom got a job .
Tom speaks French better than I do .
I want you to not go to Boston with Tom .
I &apos;d like to hear your opinion .
There &apos;s no telling how long it &apos;ll take us to find Tom .
Tom likes to go swimming in the summer .
I bought this guitar for just thirty dollars .
Who died ?
Tom wasn &apos;t helping me .
I &apos;m not at all surprised .
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom all week .
How would you like to do us a very big favor ?
Tom knows this .
Why did you buy the flowers ?
That didn &apos;t help us .
We sometimes meet them .
I &apos;m a little nervous .
Why does Tom want to be a policeman ?
When did you get my letter ?
I &apos;m going to be late for class .
Tom read a book .
I think about Tom every day .
He doesn &apos;t like to wait until the last moment to do something .
Is your name Tom ?
We &apos;re always careful .
I never go anywhere .
It &apos;s close by .
Take care of yourself .
Did you play baseball yesterday ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live far from here .
Tom can &apos;t remember Mary &apos;s address .
You can &apos;t have any of this cake .
Tom took a taxi to the hospital .
I didn &apos;t know Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
I wish he were here .
Tom and Mary usually get home later than their parents do .
Did you like that ?
We tried for almost an hour .
He looks healthy .
I think I can help with that .
Tom was told he couldn &apos;t win .
There &apos;s nothing more to say .
I &apos;m happy you &apos;re happy .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him somewhere before .
The job is almost finished .
Tom seems quite busy .
I don &apos;t have many friends .
I can &apos;t explain what I don &apos;t understand .
When did I give you that ?
I thought that I told you already to go to bed .
Where are you sitting now ?
This is a good dictionary .
It &apos;s no use trying to convince Tom .
Tom and Mary have been married three years .
Tom is going to be there .
Has Tom told Mary about how he met John ?
I talked to her on the telephone .
I hope Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Tom should &apos;ve waited for us .
We haven &apos;t got all day .
The police are after me .
Tom is going to be with you .
He went by bicycle .
I used to be pretty good at this .
Tom has experience doing that .
Which one of you is Tom ?
What were Tom and Mary doing here ?
Tom lives here alone .
I &apos;m still hungry .
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened .
Didn &apos;t Tom go to Mary &apos;s house ?
He is as old as my father .
This is better than nothing .
What do you want me to ask Tom ?
He had the courage to say it .
You &apos;re running short of time .
He doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
How many kids do you have ?
Tom comes from a small town .
I still love you .
Tom still loves Mary .
Tom was standing .
I &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
Is Tom one of your friends ?
What have you told them ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at work .
I &apos;m very busy now .
My bag is empty .
I can &apos;t talk about it right now .
Tom was afraid to go to sleep .
Tom and Mary probably don &apos;t know each other .
Tom wanted to know why Mary couldn &apos;t go .
Do you have a pen on you ?
I want something else .
He &apos;s old enough to go to school .
I &apos;m not happy about this .
He gets up at seven .
I &apos;m out of here .
I don &apos;t care for him .
Tom tried that .
They don &apos;t like me .
It &apos;s going to be all right .
This book has many beautiful pictures .
It may already be too late for him .
Tom knew that Mary was John and Alice &apos;s daughter .
Are you certain it was an accident ?
We &apos;ll go .
I forgot to give you what Tom gave me to give you .
Have your parents met your girlfriend yet ?
You will never be too old to learn .
I feel really stupid .
I think I &apos;d like to be your friend .
It could be Tom .
If something happens , it &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault , not mine .
Who are we ?
I have three sisters and a brother .
How do you get to school ?
I thought Tom had something to tell you .
Do you want me to help you or not ?
He is going to be a father soon .
I know someone who speaks French very well .
I can &apos;t give Tom these .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
I think you should see a doctor .
Tom is still living at home with his parents .
I still don &apos;t understand how it works .
Is that all you want ?
What does Tom want with me ?
He has a dog .
I &apos;ll always remember the first time I saw Tom .
I have an older brother and a younger sister .
I usually eat meat once a day .
Tom was killed .
You don &apos;t want me to do that .
I had no choice but to stay .
That isn &apos;t what I want to see .
I wasn &apos;t the one who asked Tom to do that .
We &apos;ve been looking for you .
I &apos;m used to staying up late .
Nobody ever came to see me in the hospital .
There &apos;s nothing I really have to do today .
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you were the one who killed his father ?
Are you a policeman ?
Do you want to see them ?
You &apos;d better not do anything like that again .
What do you think I &apos;m thinking ?
They should have arrived home by now .
That &apos;s what you want to do , isn &apos;t it ?
I want something to read .
I don &apos;t have a car , but my sister does .
We were supposed to go swimming together .
We stayed at our uncle &apos;s .
I don &apos;t feel like waiting any longer .
Were you drunk at the party ?
You can &apos;t just quit .
Tom wasn &apos;t upset .
What a beautiful garden !
It &apos;s a very good question .
I read some books .
I &apos;d like a beer .
Did you hit Tom ?
I &apos;m just asking .
Do it quickly .
You can &apos;t bring your cat to school .
You know people .
It &apos;s time for our children to go to bed .
He looks like a good boy .
What does this look like ?
Tom didn &apos;t call .
I know I &apos;m not perfect .
I don &apos;t like you .
Tom says that he loved Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you what Tom told me .
I go shopping every morning .
She had no other choice but to marry the old man .
He is writing a book .
It &apos;s not as big a problem as you think .
Tom and Mary never got along .
Where &apos;s Tom been ?
I want this camera .
Tell Tom he has to get home before 2 : 30 .
I &apos;m going to be an uncle .
We &apos;re good at it .
Tom is older than I thought he was .
I &apos;ve got a book .
I only have one question .
Tom isn &apos;t a student . He &apos;s a teacher .
Tom is serious .
Tom &apos;s mother has died .
I had to stay in bed for a while .
Tom told Mary that John was outside with Alice .
You don &apos;t know me .
It &apos;s difficult to understand his ideas .
They said it &apos;s OK .
I know that you did it on purpose .
Do you know Tom &apos;s secret ?
We have to wash the clothes .
How much do I owe ?
I think Tom believes everything Mary says .
Tom knew everyone .
What do I have to do ?
It is nothing but a joke .
I always try to be honest .
Who bought you this dress ?
I &apos;m listening to music .
I &apos;ve heard everything .
I thought you would say that .
I cannot tell how this is done .
Mary said that she thought Tom was innocent .
I would rather stay at home .
He did not buy it after all .
I will be back in two week &apos;s time .
The man behind them is playing the piano .
What does Tom like to do that Mary doesn &apos;t like to do ?
We &apos;re not happy .
I think I &apos;m crazy .
Our team lost .
I am learning Japanese .
I wish I &apos;d had enough time to do that .
I know Tom is innocent .
Did Tom , by any chance , let Mary drive the car ?
Tom is a really nice kid .
Why didn &apos;t anybody do anything ?
Where are we going to meet ?
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
We &apos;re going dancing tonight .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that my father is in prison .
I can take you home now .
He is now staying in Paris .
I have to go now .
I am happy that you are my friend .
Tom bought Mary flowers .
I forgot to tell them .
I didn &apos;t like that any more than you did .
Let &apos;s meet Tom .
Tom &apos;s face is red .
Tom is very lucky to be alive .
You &apos;ll never be alone again .
You have no idea how to do this , do you ?
Tom is not as old as you .
I knew you &apos;d ask about that .
I didn &apos;t expect such a nice present from you .
No one will believe Tom .
Can we afford that ?
I have a lot of homework .
We didn &apos;t get far .
He told me that he had lost his watch .
Call Tom and tell him I can &apos;t meet him this afternoon .
Did you make that mistake on purpose ?
I didn &apos;t feed the dog .
You don &apos;t know how much I appreciate this .
Where is this train going ?
We can get what we want without your help .
I want you to wait for me .
Tom was lying the whole time .
How do I stop Tom ?
The question is where to buy the book .
How old is your grandfather ?
May I use your car today ?
Tom asked why you had spent time in prison .
Everyone wants something .
Tom promised he &apos;d help us .
You can use my bicycle .
This is what we want to know .
Tom bought a camera yesterday .
I think I &apos;ve heard this song before .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to help you .
I &apos;ll be back late tonight .
I took my shirt off .
He loved her very much .
I &apos;ll go there on Monday , too .
It was cold in Boston .
Tom is going to apologize .
Tom makes a lot more money than I do .
My father isn &apos;t at home .
Tom says that he &apos;s very rich .
We &apos;re coming for you .
Where &apos;s your phone ?
Maybe I don &apos;t need Tom .
Do you want that ?
These glasses are beautiful .
Why didn &apos;t I think of it myself ?
I thought you might be able to tell me how to do this .
Tom is waiting for me .
Tom and Mary were happy .
Tom got married to Mary last month .
She &apos;s waiting for you at home .
She says she likes flowers .
He needs you .
They &apos;re all older than you .
What does that have to do with us ?
Tom has a house in Boston .
Tom wears a tie to work .
Just tell me what you know about the problem .
Tom will never have to worry about money .
I &apos;d very much like to go .
We &apos;ll wait .
Tom has forgotten his umbrella again .
Tom is lying ill in bed .
She and I usually agree .
The food is cold .
The noise is driving me crazy .
I heard what you said to Tom at school .
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re really in love with me .
Tom is a good cook .
What &apos;ll you do this weekend ?
He went to America .
There &apos;s something else you need to do .
Tom and Mary are like that .
It is not the best solution .
Tom walked fast .
Don &apos;t you want to know ?
Tom is your friend .
I don &apos;t understand what he wants .
Tom changed that .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary that he was married .
When was the last time you saw Tom at school ?
We haven &apos;t seen anyone .
Tom should study French .
I come from Japan .
Tom wasn &apos;t asleep .
I do it because I like to do it .
He did not come .
I &apos;m sure we &apos;d be able to do this if we had Tom &apos;s help .
Don &apos;t give up like that .
Be kind to the old .
Tom is much better than you .
No one &apos;s here .
What a beautiful morning !
Tom looked through the window at the street .
Tom wanted Mary to go to Boston with him .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary could swim .
Why do I have to learn all this stuff ?
Nobody can understand me .
What more can be said ?
How old were you then ?
Since he could not work out the problem that way , he tried another way .
Mary can &apos;t decide whether or not to buy the dress .
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow .
Did you go to see a doctor ?
I gave up .
Tom decided then and there to never let this happen again .
I have written a letter .
That &apos;s not what you said .
Mary is older than her husband .
Tom had one daughter .
Tom had a good teacher .
The river is no longer as clean as it used to be .
Do you really think Tom will help us ?
Tom was the first one to leave .
I remember the day Tom broke his leg .
How much does Tom spend a month ?
Tom never talked about it much .
Don &apos;t forget to go see Tom tomorrow .
I got a new camera .
May I kiss you ?
Are you sure that you want to do this ?
What did you do wrong ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me about this ?
Even now , it wouldn &apos;t be possible .
I finished work at six .
Tom knows when to stop .
I can stay with Tom for a couple of weeks .
I &apos;m not afraid of Tom anymore .
We knew you were sick .
This is where we live .
Where did you learn that ?
It won &apos;t take long .
You may take this .
I say go for it .
This is what I need .
It &apos;s not good .
You &apos;ve got a lot to learn .
Tom can swim very well .
I haven &apos;t heard a word from them in over four years .
Can I catch a taxi near here ?
That &apos;s all I saw .
These books aren &apos;t for children .
Tom is seriously ill .
A car drove past .
Tom said he was in love with you .
It &apos;s too difficult .
It &apos;s worth a try .
The two of us are students .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he &apos;s going to live next year .
She loves cats .
We have arrived .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t very hungry .
A lot of students around the world are studying English .
I have something to say to you .
The baby appears hungry all the time .
Someone has stolen all my money .
What should they do in this situation ?
He can &apos;t read it .
I was just trying to help .
You have to do that .
Tom sat watching TV .
I think I will take a vacation this week .
Tom isn &apos;t wearing a shirt .
How can you tell Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
You have beautiful eyes .
What did you learn ?
I don &apos;t care where you &apos;re eating dinner .
Stop it , Tom .
Tom is going to buy a new computer .
Where &apos;s the cat ?
Thanks for doing this .
Do I have to do what Tom says ?
Why is Tom even here ?
I need a doctor .
I &apos;d rather go for a walk than see the movie .
This isn &apos;t for me .
Has Tom eaten yet ?
You sound like your mother .
Tom was just about to leave .
Tom knew he was going to win .
I know that he is not going to pay me .
Please find Tom .
Who told you Tom broke his leg ?
I plan to go back to Boston as soon as I can .
He loved me , but he doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
There were a lot of people there .
I bought the book for myself , not for my wife .
I &apos;m at a friend &apos;s house .
It was three years ago .
May I have a glass of water ?
Tom asked his teacher for advice .
I want them to be my friends .
I have already done my homework .
Tom thinks he &apos;s too good for us .
I definitely won &apos;t give up .
I drink the water .
Tom doesn &apos;t work for us anymore .
Tom is often absent from class .
How could it be ?
I know you like Tom .
Where do we go after we die ?
Can someone answer the telephone ?
No one agreed with me .
Get out .
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train .
That wouldn &apos;t be Tom , would it ?
I told Tom to help Mary .
What do we owe Tom ?
Do you really like your car ?
Tom is just a little nervous .
I looked in the window .
I can &apos;t help myself .
Let me say what I think .
Tom gave me his word .
It &apos;s cold today !
They &apos;re doing it now .
I don &apos;t look like that .
I can &apos;t see anything .
They &apos;re washing their hands .
Tom and Mary are doing that .
I &apos;m getting better every day .
Tom needs a new pair of glasses .
We should really try harder .
I asked Tom a question .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his dinner yet .
Is that what people do ?
I don &apos;t care what you say .
How fast did Tom run ?
Tom could see Mary .
It would be nice if it stopped raining .
My mom doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
This is my sister , Mary .
I expect Tom will win .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want that .
You &apos;ve just missed Tom .
If I &apos;d had enough money , I would &apos;ve bought that computer .
What ship did Tom arrive on ?
I wanted Tom to learn French .
There are many beautiful things on earth that I don &apos;t need .
I &apos;m afraid I have no choice .
Can he do this job ?
Tom has a bicycle .
That &apos;s all we know .
We &apos;re not expecting your help .
There were few people in the park .
I am leaving at four .
Tom wasn &apos;t alive .
I &apos;m famous .
We &apos;re all going to miss Tom .
I never want to see him again .
Tom has one brother .
She gave us a present .
Now isn &apos;t a very good time .
Are you a teacher or a student ?
What &apos;s under your bed ?
I &apos;m sorry about that , Tom .
Could I have the bill , please ?
That &apos;s serious .
I &apos;ll take a look .
I want to be more like Tom .
The men are coming .
I have people over to my place all the time .
Tom is fast , but Mary isn &apos;t .
Tom did his homework in the kitchen .
He gave in .
We &apos;re not in love . We &apos;re just good friends .
He was playing tennis all day .
This &apos;ll be fun .
I know a little French .
He works all night .
You must move quickly .
It may be that he is not a bad man .
There &apos;s still a bit of it left .
This word is new to me .
Could we please go home now ?
I &apos;ll miss you when you &apos;re gone .
I paid for it already .
They &apos;ve changed a lot .
He wanted to go to sea .
&quot; How many children do you have ? &quot; &quot; I only have one . &quot;
What does this say ?
Tom stayed in Australia for about three months .
I &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
How do you like New York ?
I have told you everything I know about Germany .
Tom stayed .
I don &apos;t know anything about him .
Tom will find something .
What do I need to do now ?
We &apos;ve only got three days .
That &apos;s a book .
My wife is mad .
Tom and Mary each have a bicycle .
Everyone likes Tom .
Let &apos;s speak French .
You &apos;re almost as tall as your father .
Is that supposed to happen ?
That &apos;s the guy I was telling you about .
Tom can do it better than me .
It &apos;s not worth the pain .
I called Tom and told him about my problem .
It wasn &apos;t you , was it ?
To tell the truth , I do not like him .
Tom thought that was a good idea .
I can &apos;t help but think you &apos;re making a mistake .
Let me see you again .
I want this matter taken care of immediately .
My brother lives there .
I never gave up hope .
There are a lot of people who can &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s only Monday .
The moment I walked into the room , I knew something was wrong .
You &apos;re my type .
We &apos;ll see to it later .
What were they doing there ?
This car has been used for the past ten years .
I might not have to do that until October .
Who gave you this ?
You &apos;re very sweet .
Was Tom fired ?
Did you ever try ?
The boy is kind .
No one &apos;s looking .
The cat seems to want some water .
Will you have another glass of wine ?
Everything I told you is the truth .
Tom is just a kid .
It is very hot in this room , isn &apos;t it ?
What are you going to have ?
His parents expect too much of him .
Tom , I &apos;m with you on this .
When do I get to meet Tom ?
I &apos;m sorry that you can &apos;t come this evening .
The others weren &apos;t so lucky .
What do you want with me ?
Give some meat to the dog .
Are you from the bank ?
That &apos;s how life is .
Tom and Mary just don &apos;t trust John .
You have a family to think of .
I &apos;m sure that I can handle it .
Tom has to do it .
We are at home today .
Tom says that he &apos;s just eaten .
They &apos;re not happy .
When Tom &apos;s happy , I &apos;m happy .
Tom believed that John was his brother .
We don &apos;t even know if they &apos;re planning to help us or not .
He has some money in the bank .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to go to the park with us .
Tell Tom when you &apos;ll be back .
We &apos;re just looking around .
I really miss you .
I &apos;m late for lunch .
Is that all you have to say to me ?
Tom says he has nothing to do with the matter .
Tom is going to be thirty next year .
Tom is Canadian .
He stopped reading the newspaper .
What made you want to do that ?
Tom looked ready .
I got to the station this morning .
I &apos;m going to give you one more chance .
I wish I could stay with you .
Tom still hates Mary .
Tom went and shut the window .
Did you sleep well last night ?
These are mine .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you next Sunday .
Tom was walking .
Tom often goes to the park in the morning .
What &apos;s the weather like in New York ?
I am better .
Are you about to do it ?
Are you happy now ?
My father &apos;s name is Tom .
I know Tom helped you .
I don &apos;t want any fruit .
Were you home last night ?
Why is that ?
He sat on the bed .
I wish it were that simple .
I prefer rice to bread .
How long have you been waiting ?
I &apos;m sure that your parents are very proud of you .
I want to do it for you .
Tom was loved by everybody .
I don &apos;t really understand what you want to say .
Where do you want to go ?
She doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
He seems to be honest .
Is it true that you closed the shop at nine ?
Tom was very good .
Tom knows it .
This is the camera I bought yesterday .
Mary didn &apos;t get along well with the other girls .
He was looking for a good job .
Tom is in the hospital .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk about work .
Tom wants to become rich and famous .
This room is cold .
He took me to school by car .
This hat goes together with the dress .
I &apos;m glad you brought it up .
Is it love ?
He asked me for help .
I won &apos;t help Tom again .
What did he ask you ?
Tom would like to know the reason .
He is my brother , not father .
I was tired and cold .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary and she won &apos;t talk to him .
I &apos;m too busy to go .
Tom &apos;s sorry .
Get to work .
I can &apos;t talk right now . I need to go .
I want to talk to the doctor .
You &apos;ll do great .
Tom got out of jail .
Tom is going to wash the car tomorrow .
Would you like me to carry your suitcase for you ?
Tom is scared to talk to Mary .
You can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about me .
We take that very seriously .
That &apos;s my dad .
Would you like to sit ?
We &apos;ll do it together .
You &apos;ll be better off without Tom .
Tom wanted it .
Tom still hasn &apos;t eaten dinner .
I &apos;m coming in .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I know .
What do you think it means ?
She is old enough to know better .
I don &apos;t understand you at all .
A child needs a mother .
What was inside ?
We want you to do that .
Tom tried to sleep .
Tom arrived yesterday .
He was reading a newspaper .
It &apos;s hard to say .
I can &apos;t bear the noise any longer .
Tom always leaves for school too late .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it on time .
No one knows you &apos;re here .
I didn &apos;t want to be left alone .
I &apos;d like a glass of wine .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to Mary .
There &apos;s been a lot of rain this year .
I &apos;d love to know that .
I think we have a lot in common .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom is telling the truth .
I wrote Mary a letter .
You &apos;re lucky Tom helped you .
Tom loves cooking .
Tom just doesn &apos;t get it .
Bring me something to eat .
He wasn &apos;t there last week .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to Australia last year .
I think I can help Tom with his homework .
I &apos;m looking for Tom . Do you know where he is ?
Are you down there ?
Why is everyone crying ?
Tom is making dinner .
Tom didn &apos;t find what I hid .
Tom &apos;s angry .
Who else is going to be at the party ?
How often do you come to Boston ?
Why don &apos;t you want to go to school ?
Tom lives in that house over there .
My father always took me to school when I was young .
What are you two doing ?
He is good at soccer .
I &apos;ll quit .
What did your wife say ?
We &apos;ll get one .
I think I hurt his feelings .
Don &apos;t you like this ?
Everything comes to those who wait .
Do whatever you want . I don &apos;t care .
You never told me you could speak French .
Why did Tom leave so suddenly ?
We need to talk about this .
I must help her at any cost .
Why is Tom hiding ?
Let me know when you &apos;ll be ready .
Tom had already eaten lunch when Mary arrived .
If it were not for the sun , we would all die .
Tom told Mary his phone number .
What color is your hair ?
He is proud of his son .
I hope it &apos;s true .
I &apos;ll give you a piece of advice .
Try to remember .
Where do you think Tom is going to live ?
Tom wondered who Mary was waiting for .
I can &apos;t stop laughing .
Nobody &apos;s hungry .
I have finished my homework .
That &apos;s not what I mean .
I &apos;ve seen you on TV .
We had breakfast .
I cannot stop him .
That &apos;s what you wanted , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom went to Mary &apos;s party .
I will have him call you the moment he gets back .
I &apos;ll write to you or I &apos;ll phone you next week .
Tom came by himself .
How many sisters do you have ?
I don &apos;t want to lose Mary .
Tom and I are doing fine .
Can somebody open the door please ?
Tom looked at me and smiled .
You &apos;re one of Tom &apos;s kids , aren &apos;t you ?
What &apos;s Tom given us ?
I &apos;ll be able to see you next year .
Tom can &apos;t keep his eyes off Mary .
Why won &apos;t Tom listen to me ?
They &apos;ll probably come by car .
We &apos;ve got to save Tom .
Tom seemed to have lost his key .
Tom is reading a book in his room .
She gave him some food .
I want to know how .
That &apos;s exactly what I want to hear .
Thank you for not saying anything .
Where &apos;s Tom anyway ?
Don &apos;t hurt me .
I only asked if I could borrow the book .
I had a good time last evening .
I &apos;m afraid Tom won &apos;t be able to come .
Tom didn &apos;t stay long .
I &apos;ve nothing to give .
Would you like some ice cream ?
Get Tom some food .
He wants to come with us .
Tom heard that Mary had bought a new computer .
I read a lot .
We went to the beach together .
It doesn &apos;t matter so much .
You &apos;re tired .
I &apos;m going to school in Boston .
We &apos;d like that .
Tom went to the hospital .
Tom had a cat .
I don &apos;t like beer that much .
Both sisters are pretty .
That was a big mistake .
What do you know about Australia ?
This desk takes up too much room .
You &apos;ve got my computer and I want it back .
She loves Tom more than she loves me .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think Mary will do that again .
Let &apos;s meet tomorrow at the same place we did last week .
Have you eaten your dinner already ?
He &apos;s at home right now .
Do you want me to leave ?
Tom seemed to be very happy here .
It is very kind of you to show me the way .
I &apos;m not in a good mood either .
Is Tom out there ?
He isn &apos;t lonely anymore .
You don &apos;t have to say anything you don &apos;t want to say .
I read a book last night .
I think you should do it .
Can you leave it with me till this afternoon ?
Would you lend your dictionary to me ?
I told you before not to do that .
He took the trouble to show me the way to the station .
I didn &apos;t know you were going to be here today .
Did you speak French yesterday ?
Everything I did , I did for Tom .
He was known to everybody in the village .
Tom wasn &apos;t young .
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon .
Perhaps it &apos;s Tom .
There is almost no water in this bottle .
He easily gets angry .
I need to talk to him .
I don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
We were eating lunch together .
Tom will probably like this game .
No one &apos;s listening .
We should visit Boston again .
Tom is a bit on the shy side .
It &apos;s not about the money .
Have you ever seen this movie before ?
You know Tom is telling the truth .
If I were healthy , I would be happy .
I know who Tom talked to .
Tom wants to take a day off .
The word is no longer in use .
Tom is a very good teacher .
Call home !
I would like to come to your party .
Tom thinks it &apos;s better not to lend Mary any money .
I know what we can do .
We &apos;d better stop .
Tom is probably in the building .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long he &apos;ll have to wait for Mary .
I usually go to bed at ten .
He gave me food and money as well .
I found a piece of paper in the room .
Let me help you with that .
There &apos;s nothing to it .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t scared .
I know this is hard .
That will happen later .
Tom may do that here .
Don &apos;t forget to buy milk .
We &apos;re not going to talk to Tom .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to live like this anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play outside .
That &apos;s what we do .
I hope everyone knows what this means .
He closed his eyes .
It &apos;s too late .
Tom is quite right .
He was not disappointed .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d help him .
Tom seems to know his stuff .
Tom broke my heart .
Tom is his name , I think .
I like English best .
I can take the bus .
Has Tom finished already ?
What are you going to do here ?
Tom and Mary look very tired .
I &apos;m in Boston all this week .
Does he come here ?
I &apos;ll be with Tom .
Tom wants to know why Mary didn &apos;t go to school today .
Tom said that he wanted to teach me French .
It &apos;s nearly three o &apos;clock .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to think I was stupid .
What &apos;s the best way for me to get a passport ?
We must be careful .
How many other people are there ?
We &apos;re at war .
I &apos;m looking forward to doing this again .
Here is your book .
Someone opened the window .
Please sit down for a minute .
When does Tom go to school ?
Why did you not go to Boston ?
They blame Tom for everything .
We must find them .
He &apos;s doing his best .
Is this the key your uncle is looking for ?
I &apos;ve often heard about you .
We &apos;ll watch you .
Let me do it my way .
Are you two busy right now ?
I used to play alone when I was a child .
All of us want to live as long as possible .
Tom isn &apos;t welcome here .
That &apos;d be impossible .
I told Tom I wasn &apos;t interested .
I wish I could speak English .
You gave me your word .
Tom has many friends here .
I want to live in the country .
I am calling my brother .
I worry about the kids .
Tom had had enough .
It &apos;s not the end of the world .
Are you the boss ?
Did you like the movie we watched yesterday ?
I already told you everything I know .
Tom is busy now .
There may be hope for you yet .
I hope you &apos;re all having a good time .
I would like to see that .
Tom is never late for school .
All of them speak French .
Tom stayed late .
Tom ate my lunch .
I can find my own way out .
Tom is eating an apple .
What book did you buy ?
Tom and Mary sat on the bench .
I don &apos;t want to lose you again .
I was busy the whole day .
We can &apos;t do this without some help .
Do you have anything to do after that ?
Tom loves company .
I was so happy .
I have one of those , too .
Tom can &apos;t decide which camera to buy .
What do you do on Sunday ?
I &apos;m coming to get you .
I do not like him either .
When did you buy this car ?
I can tell you that it didn &apos;t happen .
Take that back .
How do I look tonight ?
We &apos;re both not as rich as we wish we were .
Who did what ?
Are you absolutely certain about this ?
How about a beer ?
I can &apos;t think of everything .
Do you need a ride ?
Do you have my book ?
I &apos;m not so sure anymore .
I can sleep a lot better now .
It &apos;s already too late .
I learned a lot this weekend .
I have homework to do .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
Whose umbrella is that ?
Who broke the bottle ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think you &apos;d do that .
I &apos;m taller than you .
I can &apos;t trust Tom .
Who &apos;s supposed to eat all that ?
Tom was my boss .
A book worth reading is worth reading twice .
There &apos;s only one problem .
I asked each boy three questions .
That doesn &apos;t interest me .
They want to learn English .
I was lucky to get this job .
I &apos;m really bored right now .
Nobody wants others to think they &apos;re stupid .
You &apos;re not old enough to get a driver &apos;s license .
It doesn &apos;t matter at all to me .
He eats nothing but fruit .
I &apos;ll be at home all day tomorrow .
I &apos;ll wait here until she comes .
Tom and Mary are going to give it a try .
I &apos;ll stand .
She can play the piano .
That &apos;s how Tom did that .
Tom isn &apos;t in a very good mood .
Tom likes to play baseball .
I &apos;m not done .
Tom looks great , doesn &apos;t he ?
This isn &apos;t a game .
You &apos;ll have to go to Boston to meet Tom next week .
He was angry with his son .
I was lucky .
I may go to Boston next month .
Tom is going to be a teacher .
He has big problems .
When I was your age , I had a boyfriend .
Do whatever you want .
Tom probably thought I wasn &apos;t able to drive .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who he should ask for advice .
She got through her work before five .
I know that much myself .
What do you want to tell us ?
Tom drove all night while Mary slept next to him .
Tom wants to borrow some money .
Tom asked Mary some questions .
It &apos;s not clear when he came here .
Tom came too late .
People like my mom .
Tom asked Mary a lot of questions , but she refused to answer some of them .
You probably know more about me than I know about you .
I should &apos;ve given you this sooner .
Tom would &apos;ve loved the concert .
What will become of his children after his death ?
I wasn &apos;t asleep .
Was that the problem ?
Whose turn is it ?
Tom and Mary are together .
I want to go there once more .
Can I use your dictionary for a minute ?
Could you carry this box for me , please ?
Tom came after Mary left .
Come on , wake up .
Where can I do some shopping ?
He is in poor health .
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth .
Does Tom know how to do that ?
You don &apos;t need to go at once .
Those two children were the same age .
Maybe Tom can do it .
She speaks ten languages .
How did you come to hear that ?
Where are you taking me ?
We &apos;re dancing .
Tom asked Mary to leave .
I don &apos;t want to lose my girlfriend .
We don &apos;t have to be here .
Tom can &apos;t speak much French .
I was in love with Tom once .
I didn &apos;t know he was dead .
She refused to take the money .
Don &apos;t forget to write to me .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has to do that or not .
We &apos;re not exactly sure what it was .
We &apos;re all hungry .
It is impossible to live without water .
Tom was supposed to come .
The baby is able to walk .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell us ?
Tom said we should start early .
You should &apos;ve called me .
I &apos;ll give you anything that you want .
There are too many things to do !
I know her by name , but not by sight .
I want a piece of cake .
She gave him the car .
Tom is all alone .
I have no problem with this .
I want to sleep .
I think I know what &apos;s happening now .
That is just her way .
I &apos;ll be thinking of you today .
Have you received the letter ?
It is no use trying again .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can sing well or not .
I drank tea yesterday .
Tom always drives too fast .
Tom isn &apos;t crazy .
They walked .
I remember how angry you made me .
I &apos;ll let you know later .
Don &apos;t do this again .
Tom must be nearly thirty .
To be always honest is not easy .
Why is he hiding under the table ?
It &apos;s a nice day today .
He left his keys in the car .
You like English , don &apos;t you ?
Both of my parents can speak French .
She went with him .
How long have you been away ?
He looked well .
I didn &apos;t start wearing glasses until I was thirty .
He went to school only for a few years .
This watch was your grandfather &apos;s .
Tom is at the hotel now .
Why are you afraid of Tom ?
He came at me with a knife in his hand .
Tom didn &apos;t want to name names .
Tom is about three years older than Mary .
Tom knows his way around Boston .
It appears that he is honest .
Tom went to bed .
I eat meat .
Excuse me , but could you show me the way to the station ?
There is nothing to do .
Everyone is against me .
Tom and Mary like each other .
Where did all the bread go ?
Where do you want to go , then ?
Tom knows Australia well .
This book is Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;m not very good at it .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were in love with Tom ?
We &apos;re not as young as Tom .
I &apos;m in Boston now .
I think it &apos;s important to tell the truth .
Tom should tell Mary that .
Tom plans to buy a new bicycle .
I &apos;ll find someone .
Tom needed help .
We can &apos;t afford that .
Tom likes me .
How many minutes does it actually take to do that ?
How many sisters do they have ?
Nobody &apos;s ever heard of him .
You &apos;re not a Canadian , are you ?
She is proud of her daughter .
Everyone waited .
We could &apos;ve died .
Tom is in a bad mood today .
When are you coming back to the office ?
I wonder if dinner is ready .
It &apos;s not the same without you .
Is this wine ?
I like this tea .
I wish I could travel around the world .
Tom has been busy since this morning .
Tom and I don &apos;t do that .
Do we have enough time to finish this before Tom gets here ?
I wish I had a girlfriend .
Did you do your homework by yourself ?
You should phone Tom .
Tom wants to be at home .
Tom is very interested in learning French .
When did you begin studying French ?
We &apos;d better have a talk .
What was it like ?
I don &apos;t quite agree with Tom .
What would Tom do without us ?
Why don &apos;t you just shut up ?
This happened for a reason .
Tom didn &apos;t write so often .
Who is the man who was talking with you ?
I think Tom may do that .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy here .
I have to speak with you .
No one was late .
You know what I want .
Tom didn &apos;t think so at all .
We study French at school every day .
I saw that .
We &apos;ll be living here next month .
I won &apos;t be able to eat all that by myself .
Tom said he can &apos;t eat that much food by himself .
I like Tom because he &apos;s honest .
It could be true .
This is my bike .
Do you have a plan ?
Tom became very hot .
We &apos;re out of coffee .
I didn &apos;t say that .
I just couldn &apos;t sleep .
It &apos;s just a matter of time before someone is injured or killed .
I might be able to help you tomorrow .
I have run out of money .
There was a strong wind that day .
May I speak to you alone ?
I &apos;d never have done that that way .
Tom didn &apos;t go to college .
Tom and Mary want to know what our plan is .
Tell us why you &apos;re here .
Tom caught three fish this afternoon .
What did Tom have in his pocket ?
Have you ever been late for class ?
I like this music .
That &apos;s not really a solution .
Do you want to buy a shirt ?
He walked past the house .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the reason .
I think you should go out with Tom .
Tom arrived ahead of Mary .
Who are you all ?
We &apos;re not going to give Tom the money he asked for .
Where are you off to ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
They &apos;ll never know we &apos;re here .
I do my homework after school .
When do you want to go ?
Tom might not be as happy as we think he is .
The door is open now .
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and his three children .
I am a man .
It &apos;s at home .
Is that important ?
Tom says he &apos;s innocent .
I have never met a person like him .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave Australia .
He returned home for the first time in ten years .
Just say you &apos;re sorry .
The coffee &apos;s ready .
They &apos;re great .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to change .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off Mary .
There &apos;s one small problem .
She sometimes takes a walk in the park .
I managed to make him understand it .
He was sitting between Mary and Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to swim .
Tom never drinks coffee this late in the day .
I want to study French .
Tom talked about his family .
I usually swim in the morning .
This is no good .
Tom saw the pictures .
I had never been kissed before .
The dog seems sick .
They understand now .
Can we help you with something ?
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who can sing well and who can &apos;t .
That &apos;s very good news .
Tell me what I should &apos;ve done .
Why don &apos;t we go dancing ?
Please look at me .
I asked him to come with me and he agreed .
He asked the man to help him .
He would not listen to my advice .
Nobody is perfect .
I &apos;m not feeling well today .
We &apos;ll look after Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid of death .
He will be in New York for two weeks .
I &apos;ll go see it .
Don &apos;t you have something to say to Tom ?
You have nothing to worry about .
I got to know her through one of my friends .
I don &apos;t care if anyone believes me or not .
Do you have any children ?
I will take the next plane for New York .
Tom cannot drive .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know .
The other one doesn &apos;t work .
I guess it won &apos;t matter .
You act surprised . What did you expect ?
You &apos;re not telling the truth .
I know the boy .
Don &apos;t fool yourself . He doesn &apos;t love you .
I don &apos;t know why you want me to do that .
What time do you want to meet tomorrow ?
They loved you .
This made me very sad .
I &apos;m sure everything will be OK now .
I wonder what &apos;s inside the box .
Let &apos;s finish the job .
It &apos;s what Tom believed .
Tom can &apos;t be old enough to have a daughter as old as Mary .
I have to leave now .
Tom can &apos;t mean that .
Tom told me that he wasn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
That is something you should not have said .
The man sitting next to me spoke to me .
You ought to know better at your age .
I wish I could spend more time with you .
I asked Tom where Mary was .
I forgot what I was about to say .
I haven &apos;t slept in days .
I cannot do without this dictionary .
What &apos;s happened to the money ?
I &apos;d rather go hungry than eat this .
Tom drove faster .
Could you call a doctor , please ?
I wonder what I need to do .
We &apos;re not busy .
Tom is looking for someone who speaks French .
I &apos;m sorry , but he isn &apos;t home .
Tom told me to be kind to others .
Tom is happy again .
We don &apos;t have much choice .
What are you cooking ?
Tom told me so himself .
Tom didn &apos;t want to move to Boston .
That &apos;s what most of my friends call me .
I barely know Tom .
I told you you &apos;d be disappointed .
That wasn &apos;t a very nice thing to do .
We can do better than that .
Are these Tom &apos;s shoes ?
Tom knows you can &apos;t speak French very well .
I &apos;m your father .
I &apos;m going to give it to Tom .
You were both drunk .
Will she get well soon ?
Tom is better off than before .
I like cats more than dogs .
What do your friends call you ?
How would I know where Tom is ?
Are you still friends with Tom ?
Tell Tom what this is .
They say that she was born in Germany .
Are you back home now ?
This might not have anything to do with the problem at hand .
We &apos;ll meet Tom there .
My life is empty without him .
She said she had been happy .
I &apos;ve never heard of that city .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you could speak French ?
I wonder why Tom studied French .
Tom began to eat lunch .
They aren &apos;t waiting for the bus .
What I need is a friend .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to open the box .
You promised that Tom would be here .
Tom let the cat in .
Here &apos;s the bus .
What &apos;re we doing here ?
Do you know how to do it ?
They have lived in London for ten years .
Is this the book you &apos;re looking for ?
I &apos;ve decided that I won &apos;t go to Boston tomorrow .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom isn &apos;t my son .
I think I &apos;m going to stay here .
Tom needs glasses .
We have a cat and a dog .
My father must do the work .
I can &apos;t help feeling sorry for the girl .
Tom was trying to be funny .
You &apos;re the only one who can help me .
Tom had so much money that he did not know what to do with it . It was far more than he needed to live .
Tom has no friends .
A promise is quickly forgotten .
I was having lunch .
Tom wanted Mary to be his wife .
I &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t do anything .
You had better do your homework at once .
Mary is cute .
Tom wasn &apos;t done .
Don &apos;t come near me .
Go there with me .
It is kind of pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
I love your daughter .
Why don &apos;t you just apologize ?
When were you born ?
Tom is a father .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes me .
I &apos;ll take that one , too .
I never heard that joke before .
They &apos;ve seen Tom .
Tom is like his father .
Why don &apos;t you go out ?
I &apos;m going to go tomorrow no matter what .
We need to hurry .
We arrived in New York at night .
I do think it &apos;s possible .
I &apos;m going to come .
Where &apos;s today &apos;s newspaper ?
He is soon to be a father .
You had better not see her today .
Do you think we can help Tom ?
My mother speaks slowly .
We met that night .
Tom is better looking than you .
It wasn &apos;t the first time .
Do you have bread for lunch ?
I am to go to Paris .
I want to meet with Tom .
I might have left it on the table .
Tom is on his own now .
She &apos;s three years older than I am .
He &apos;s afraid of making mistakes .
Tom gave me several books .
I should &apos;ve known Tom would be here , too .
She had a little money .
It was not easy for us to find his house .
Is there anything else to eat ?
I bought Tom a new car .
Tom is often late for school .
I &apos;ll tell him that .
Where did he learn this ?
We don &apos;t expect Tom to live much longer .
Is that car yours ?
No one &apos;s looking at you .
My house is near the school .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
You &apos;ll never guess what Tom did .
What do we do after this ?
Where does he work ?
I have to go back .
It &apos;s nearly six o &apos;clock .
I was up almost all night .
We barely had time to do everything that had to be done .
She &apos;s got more books .
I have no money .
I haven &apos;t seen you around before .
Tom will pay for what he did .
I think Tom might know something .
Where do you want me ?
What are you sorry about ?
You know what &apos;s about to happen , right ?
Tom said that he loved Mary .
Can it be true ?
I bought the car .
I can &apos;t remember any of it .
It took him ten minutes to solve the problem .
I sent you the money you asked for .
I don &apos;t want to go shopping by myself .
What should I say ?
We can &apos;t help that .
I &apos;d like some fish .
Tom is certain to come on time .
I need more time .
I don &apos;t have what I want .
What do you think I should &apos;ve done ?
I couldn &apos;t wait .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell Mary the truth ?
Tom is going to help us tomorrow .
I thought you didn &apos;t want to talk about this matter .
Did Tom tell you what to do ?
What &apos;s this chair doing here ?
I think this is great .
Tom isn &apos;t funny , but Mary is .
He became rich .
Tom came to my house yesterday .
There are still people who cannot read .
I prefer working alone .
How do you say &quot; love &quot; in French ?
Tom saw nothing .
It &apos;s a matter of life and death .
Make sure you tell Tom .
I &apos;d like to play tennis .
She &apos;s about the same age as me .
I didn &apos;t finish reading that book .
I am a student of this school .
How much food do you need ?
I &apos;d like some shoes .
I am looking forward to Christmas .
What did Tom do then ?
Tom is quite popular , isn &apos;t he ?
It is a good cake .
You always make mistakes .
Tom is from Australia .
Tom is very nice to me .
I don &apos;t like Tom either .
Tom waited .
What language is this ?
I have an exam tomorrow .
If you know the answer to this question , please tell me .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
Be quiet while I &apos;m speaking .
Tom knows Boston well .
When did you go to London ?
I wonder where Tom studied French .
I met him yesterday for the first time .
Everybody thinks I &apos;m dead .
There &apos;s still one thing I don &apos;t understand .
Why didn &apos;t you visit Boston ?
My father &apos;s a doctor .
Tom is probably at home .
I &apos;d like to work for you as long as possible .
Has Tom returned ?
Tom sold his company .
Tom told me he felt cold .
You aren &apos;t going to tell Tom , are you ?
I was planning on going to the beach today , but then it started to rain .
He will be free tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Boston .
Tom and Mary were walking side by side .
I know Tom &apos;s brother .
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
Tom isn &apos;t very different from anybody else .
We &apos;re pretty disappointed .
Tom does that , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like fish .
Do you feel like watching a movie ?
You aren &apos;t alone .
Aren &apos;t you guys coming ?
Where are you ?
It &apos;s quite simple .
They won &apos;t find it .
Is this what Tom wants ?
Make love , not war .
The baby is asleep .
I think it &apos;s interesting .
I &apos;m afraid for you .
I made them myself .
When you leave , I &apos;ll miss you .
Give that to Tom .
He bought a new car .
Tom opened a beer .
Tom &apos;s strong .
How are things going with you ?
Tom has work to do .
I never want to hear his name again .
We want to help you .
Were you invited ?
Tom came .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m doing this .
Tom got dressed and went outside .
Tom must be from Boston .
What are you doing up there ?
We all have a lot to learn .
She is convinced that her son is still alive .
I have to stay home today .
You would love it .
You &apos;re my only real friend .
I want to become better at swimming .
My brother is out .
I want to know about Tom .
My life is in danger .
Are you sure Tom is here ?
Tom would help us if he could .
I think that she knows the truth .
This is the church where we got married .
Is this hat yours ?
I think they like me .
What questions did they ask ?
Tom asked me where I lived .
Tom is lying on his back .
Why do you think that ?
I could help you with that .
Is Tom still at school ?
You were too smart for me , Tom .
Tom really made it happen .
She took a taxi to the hospital .
It seems that he &apos;s happy .
We aren &apos;t like that .
There is no city in Europe as big as Tokyo .
Tom has other things on his mind right now .
It &apos;s been a long time since I visited my grandmother .
Why are you doing this to me ?
I &apos;d like to go somewhere else now .
I waited for him all day long .
What did Tom just tell you ?
Please open this box .
I met him once .
Tom has made many new friends .
Tom said he thought that Mary needed to do that before she left .
My father &apos;s car is new .
I think Tom is rich .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you today .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at home ?
He has made a promise to come again .
Was that a no ?
I thought Mary was pretty .
Tom and Mary are with John .
I think Tom did this .
Tom lived in Boston for years .
I didn &apos;t even know that .
We &apos;ll be home soon .
I don &apos;t know how many years I have left .
Tom and I went to school together .
Let &apos;s go tomorrow afternoon .
Tom has company .
I &apos;ll give you anything but this .
The meeting might not be so bad .
It is very small .
Tom isn &apos;t likely to know where Mary lives .
You &apos;re not going to sleep , are you ?
He came back after many years .
You don &apos;t have to make up your mind right now .
Did you hear something ?
I meant it as a joke .
You should ask a doctor .
I don &apos;t want Tom &apos;s help .
I &apos;d love to get one of those .
He is reading a book .
That was Tom .
She wanted to understand .
She can ask and answer questions .
You need a key to open the box .
Tom does love Mary .
Let me know if you need anything .
We all need love .
Tom could get sick .
Isn &apos;t Tom with you ?
He was wearing glasses .
Tom couldn &apos;t convince everyone .
Tom had no friends to play with .
She &apos;ll spend the next four years in prison .
My mother is three years older than yours .
Do you plan on using that ?
Why don &apos;t I go ?
Who are you there with ?
I &apos;ve never played tennis with Tom .
Is something wrong ?
Tom knows that he &apos;s right .
I fell in love with her .
The street was dark .
I know the whole of the story .
This room is not very large .
Tom has been in Boston twice .
Do we even have a choice ?
She is not my sister , she &apos;s my wife .
My mother carefully opened the door .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it .
I want people to know the truth .
When is good for you ?
I &apos;ll stay with you until Tom gets here .
He took away what little money I had .
I want to hear the truth .
I think you should apologize to Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t believe me .
She takes a walk with her dog .
Why don &apos;t you come with us ?
She can play the piano very well .
Tom is always studying .
She was very busy .
I &apos;d like to study French , but I don &apos;t have the time .
There &apos;s a big problem .
They have nothing against it .
She has married a nobody .
No one could buy anything .
A few people have two cars .
What is he up to ?
It seems that I &apos;ve lost my keys .
I caught the ball with one hand .
I don &apos;t recognize any of these names .
I don &apos;t want to go back there .
Do you think that Tom will be early ?
I &apos;ve said too much .
I have a nice present to give you .
We were sick .
What am I going to do ?
Tom watched Mary swim .
I &apos;m happy about that .
Tom told Mary that she was right .
I remember having seen her somewhere .
My parents are away on a trip and I &apos;m alone in our house .
We all know Tom .
Tom ran back across the street .
Tom hasn &apos;t been home yet .
I didn &apos;t like being kept waiting so long .
I should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
Now you &apos;re safe .
Can I have a beer , please ?
It &apos;s for a friend of mine .
I guess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
Whose books are those ?
Tom might be able to help us .
I saw Tom leaving his house .
When I was a child , I could sleep anywhere .
Is that possible ?
I still don &apos;t speak much French .
You could let us go .
You had better go at once .
French is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
Does he go to school on foot or by bicycle ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom needed hope .
Tom didn &apos;t think it was right .
I want to talk to you .
He &apos;s her friend .
Tom hardly ever eats meat anymore .
We know you &apos;re in there , Tom .
Tom likes Mary .
Where did you guys meet ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to remember .
I think you &apos;d like it in Boston .
If he is innocent , then his wife is guilty .
It &apos;ll be fun to visit Boston .
I &apos;m never going to drink again .
Tom is eating something .
The language spoken in Australia is English .
Tom sat by the window .
There was nobody in the garden .
It &apos;s very white .
Tom is almost never late .
Tom wasn &apos;t that bad .
Tom seemed calm .
It &apos;s one of the things that I like about you .
Where are you going ?
Tom likes to play soccer .
You &apos;d better not eat too much .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in years .
We already knew that .
Mary is not my type .
Tom is under the bed .
Tom went to the airport .
Tom stayed at home .
I can &apos;t even help myself .
I just don &apos;t know what to say .
They had nothing to eat .
I don &apos;t have to be here . I &apos;m here because I want to be .
Tom barely said a word .
Tom told Mary his age .
I see .
I ran home .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
Someone asked for you .
Why is Tom so good at French ?
Tom bought Mary a dog .
He came to see you yesterday .
I didn &apos;t get the joke .
He must be very happy .
An uncle of mine is a doctor .
Do you have a sister ?
Tell Tom that we &apos;re leaving .
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn &apos;t do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to kiss him .
I think Tom got scared .
I &apos;m not very good at French .
What if I &apos;m right ?
I &apos;m doing well .
I was trying to help .
I can &apos;t tell the difference between them .
Thanks for the advice .
Tom should &apos;ve done it that way .
Maybe we ought to ask Tom .
He has been sick in bed for a week .
I like my new job .
I helped my mother in the kitchen .
I want a new bike .
It &apos;s almost summer .
Don &apos;t look at us .
Tom came to live here .
Is that snow ?
What are their names ?
What do you want to learn ?
What was Tom wearing ?
That &apos;s not safe .
He has stopped smoking .
Tom didn &apos;t have shoes on .
I &apos;ll be 30 this October .
I do not know where to wait for her .
He was sitting and reading a book .
We had only one chance .
It makes no difference to me .
Tom and Mary think I don &apos;t know .
Tom has a lot of courage .
I can &apos;t believe we finally made it .
Tom knew it .
I should &apos;ve studied more when I was young .
Maybe I should &apos;ve done this sooner .
This door won &apos;t open .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to do that .
This bicycle is mine .
Why does Tom want me not to do that ?
Can you solve this problem ?
Tom has only himself to blame .
We both want to go to Boston .
He just left .
I forget her name .
What do you want me to see ?
Tom would be a good teacher .
It &apos;s dark in here .
I &apos;ve heard this song before .
I need a job .
Tom called Mary to see how she was doing .
What &apos;s in the box ?
I &apos;ll remember you forever .
Did you pay for the book ?
I think you &apos;re ready .
Come on in .
Tom and Mary have become very good friends .
She doesn &apos;t listen to music at all .
It &apos;s a new book .
I must do it now .
Tom asked Mary what was wrong .
If Tom had more time , he &apos;d do that .
What would you have said ?
Tom fell asleep with his glasses on .
We don &apos;t know where Tom is , but we need to find him as soon as we can .
Is it important ?
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea ?
Why do you think Tom would do this ?
Can I come to your office tomorrow ?
What exactly does it mean ?
Tom will miss me .
I don &apos;t remember any of this .
Tom really did that well .
She &apos;s as pretty as her sister .
I don &apos;t care what you do .
I don &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t need to do that .
I &apos;m going to make you a drink .
I wish I had bought a ticket for the concert .
Tom is in the building .
Tom seemed hungry .
I should &apos;ve taken the money .
Tom was hard to please .
You must show me how it works .
Could I have some water ?
All three of us are students .
Tom was really impressed .
She is not afraid to die .
I think I &apos;ll like being here .
It didn &apos;t last more than three minutes .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t seem to be busy .
Why don &apos;t you have one ?
What are you going to do tonight ?
I &apos;ll show you the way .
He was alone there .
You need to try a little harder .
Who are all these people ?
Tom noticed Mary &apos;s bed hadn &apos;t been slept in .
Why don &apos;t you go home early today ?
I hate that movie .
Tom was surprised by how well Mary spoke French .
My parents are both from Boston .
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve thought about all the good times we used to have together .
Take us home .
I like being with Tom .
&quot; What are you thinking about ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking about you . &quot;
Are you alive ?
Can this be it ?
I &apos;d like to ask Tom to answer a few questions .
If Tom had more money , he &apos;d do that .
The ship from New York will arrive before long .
Tom wanted to see it .
I love snow .
You know that , don &apos;t you ?
How long have you guys known each other ?
Would you please write your name here ?
Tom laughed at what Mary was doing .
I &apos;ll go out and buy one as soon as I can .
I know you &apos;re here , Tom .
She got a present from her boyfriend .
We must not forget our promise .
Can you tell me the time ?
Let &apos;s get ready for school .
I don &apos;t know why he was late .
She ought to be at the office by now .
He is from France .
Tom lives only an hour away .
Tom isn &apos;t really sure .
I can never go home again .
She bought a new car .
Tom is better than me .
I got into town only a week ago .
I &apos;m not here to help you .
We &apos;re meeting at my place at 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ll be there all day .
I hope you win .
I don &apos;t like his type .
I used to play here as a child .
I found my car missing .
I can &apos;t talk to anyone else .
You &apos;re not watching .
The bus you want doesn &apos;t stop here .
Tom and Mary both look down .
Tom left an hour ago .
I &apos;m not doing that today .
Tom didn &apos;t have the courage to tell Mary the truth .
Tom stayed close .
Tom asked Mary a few questions that she wasn &apos;t able to answer .
Tom asked me to open the window .
Tom seems quite busy , doesn &apos;t he ?
Can you ride a bicycle ?
Thanks for the milk .
You should have told him .
Will he be coming this evening ?
I &apos;m proud of my brother .
All of the dogs were alive .
That girl looks like her mother .
Tom wanted to do everything himself .
Where &apos;s Tom playing ?
We can &apos;t do this without Tom .
What do we know about Tom ?
Tom killed his own father .
This water is good to drink .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary &apos;s living there alone .
Tom was surprised by what Mary said .
If Tom doesn &apos;t eat this , please give it to Mary .
Tom told me he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I want to do it right .
Tom will tell you the truth .
Tom says he always told Mary the truth .
Tom didn &apos;t tell everyone .
I want to go play with my friends .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s true .
I have a feeling that wasn &apos;t too difficult to do .
I am ready to do anything for you .
He likes to listen to the radio .
It &apos;s too far away .
What is that big building in front of us ?
I &apos;d rather not sing tonight .
He waited for me until I arrived .
I do not know if it will rain tomorrow .
This may be our only chance .
Tom taught me French .
Don &apos;t say too much .
Don &apos;t leave the water running .
When they &apos;re happy , we &apos;re happy .
He pretended to be a doctor .
Tom and I &apos;ve decided to get married .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be gone long .
I &apos;d do it again .
This isn &apos;t supposed to be happening .
Tom never does that by himself .
Tom is good at doing that .
They heard Tom .
I should &apos;ve asked Tom first .
Why did you change your mind ?
They don &apos;t listen to me .
Don &apos;t ask me to choose between you and my children .
I admit this may not be the best way of doing it .
What makes you think Tom has never done that ?
Can she come , too ?
Tom is so stupid .
Tom is much taller than I am .
Tom asked me to talk to Mary .
The cat is safe .
It &apos;s difficult to explain .
Tom had never been kissed before .
What kind of car do you drive ?
Is there any milk left ?
Let us know by next Monday .
How did you make it ?
Someone is at the front door . Go and see who it is .
He is wearing a hat .
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave his dog with me .
Tom can &apos;t win .
I know what I want to do .
Tom knows everything about cars .
Ask me again in October .
Do you want to see the house ?
Tom could hardly walk .
I went to see a movie with Tom after school .
There &apos;s something the matter with my car .
How much does an apple cost ?
I didn &apos;t go to Boston last weekend .
What do you do with these ?
What did you have for breakfast ?
We &apos;re not friends with Tom anymore .
I must convince Tom to come .
Have you spoken to your parents about this ?
Perhaps she will come tomorrow .
I hear she is going to get married next month .
Tom showed me how to do it .
Tom told me that &apos;s not true .
There &apos;ll be coffee and cake at five .
Tom wasn &apos;t ready .
I am afraid he won &apos;t come .
You &apos;re not going to like what I &apos;m about to say .
I &apos;m calling from Boston .
She lives in the village .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that yet .
I &apos;ll come , too .
I don &apos;t think this is funny .
I can &apos;t drink any more beer .
The dog is sleeping in the car .
She is good at speaking English .
Let me go with you .
Let me know if there &apos;s anything I can do .
You &apos;re very rich , aren &apos;t you ?
He &apos;s always late for class .
Did Tom hit you ?
This apple is sweet .
I don &apos;t know anything about Japan .
My mother is out there .
What do you think you &apos;d do ?
Would you like to hold my hand ?
She is now making coffee in the kitchen .
I remember the first time I heard this song .
Take off your hat .
My name is Tom , not John .
Now and then she plays tennis .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be able to find it .
I still have friends in Boston .
I have to live with it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it happened .
I &apos;d like to stand .
My life was in danger .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a computer .
That &apos;s just what Tom needs .
Tom is not as young as I am .
I wish I could do more .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been doing what he was doing .
Tom asked Mary to leave the room .
How many cars has that company bought ?
Tom should know .
We were busy .
Tom asked if what Mary said was true .
Tom took Mary back to her car .
What &apos;ll happen ?
This restaurant has been here a long time .
I made you breakfast .
I want Tom to live .
She turned down our proposal .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve felt this bad .
What time do you finish work ?
Tom went out to his car .
I have a sister .
I saw that one .
Can I get a little help , please ?
You have to see it to believe it .
Tom is one of Mary &apos;s brothers .
How many people did you see in the park ?
He has not written to them for a long time .
We always want what we can &apos;t have .
I &apos;m really sorry .
The police never showed up .
There &apos;s no beer here .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of music .
How many languages are there in Europe ?
Ask Tom what he &apos;s done .
Everybody &apos;s doing something .
Tom speaks very good French .
I won &apos;t be coming to school anymore .
His heart is broken .
I speak French at home .
Could you tell me how to get to the station ?
Tom never lied .
Tom has got it .
I &apos;m busy looking for an apartment .
I thought you &apos;d like it .
Do you want to look at this ?
We &apos;ll help you .
Tom wants to come .
Tom isn &apos;t saying why .
Tom played on his college team .
What &apos;s the matter ?
Tom is going to miss me .
I &apos;m going home with Tom .
Tom was really sick .
Why didn &apos;t she tell me ?
I think that they were all fired .
Tom made coffee .
She &apos;s a lot older than he is .
I &apos;m fine with it .
I saw him go out .
Everything went better than I had expected .
I have no idea why it is so .
What you said is true .
They aren &apos;t hungry .
Tom asked Mary not to leave him alone .
Tom put some clothes on .
I want us to win .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good decision .
I &apos;ll be free .
That is too expensive .
I just can &apos;t live without you .
Will you be doing that tomorrow ?
I have to go back to work .
I thought you were right .
I often make mistakes .
Maybe Tom would be willing to help .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he needs .
I had never done anything like that before .
There &apos;s no one but me here .
Everyone &apos;s watching Tom .
I cannot afford to keep a car .
Tom is a baby .
That was very easy .
I feel sorry for the children .
They &apos;re mad at you .
Tom said that Mary doesn &apos;t have to do that this week .
Tom isn &apos;t good at French .
Would you pass me the salt ?
Tom is going to do well .
It &apos;s white .
I want to have a job that I love .
You &apos;re students , aren &apos;t you ?
Who can do this work ?
He can speak Japanese .
You &apos;re not fast enough .
Someone is coming .
Tom was asking for it .
Tom is the person to ask .
I don &apos;t like either of them .
What does your dad do ?
I couldn &apos;t hear Tom .
Could you please tell me why ?
That &apos;s what they all say .
He taught himself French .
That &apos;s a great plan .
Tom often eats in bed .
This novel isn &apos;t as good as his last one .
That &apos;ll be possible .
It &apos;s for Tom .
She &apos;s as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
I used to love Mary .
She always fed her children before she fed her dog .
I don &apos;t know that girl &apos;s name .
It &apos;s clear .
I may not make it .
I don &apos;t want that and I know you don &apos;t want that either .
Tom didn &apos;t wait for Mary .
Let me give you a piece of advice .
I know what Tom is doing here .
I really enjoy coming here .
You &apos;re a good friend .
You may go .
We need to speak with you .
I believe that the story is true .
Tom saw something .
Why did he have to wait for you for so long ?
It wasn &apos;t your fault .
I shouldn &apos;t have done it .
Tom lives with us .
Tom and John are like brothers .
I don &apos;t like it in there .
You &apos;ve got to stop , Tom .
Tom thought the situation was really sad .
Tom and Mary were able to figure it out on their own .
She killed herself yesterday .
Tom could sell anything to anyone .
Everybody has already left .
I &apos;m confused . What do I do now ?
The law was changed .
Tom lost sight of the bird .
Tom lived there by himself .
There aren &apos;t any problems .
I don &apos;t feel like going shopping today .
I cannot do the work on my own .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to buy anything else .
Do you know who he is ?
Tom can &apos;t sleep .
You &apos;ll meet Tom .
I can swim fast .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;ll happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play tennis on Sunday .
I had no idea that you were coming .
Tom died in an accident .
I waited for him at the station for an hour , but he didn &apos;t show up .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was a doctor .
I &apos;d almost forgotten .
I &apos;m so happy you could make it .
What we need now is a rest .
Do what you think is right .
Do you think anyone can see us ?
I sat in the car .
Tom and Mary have finished their work .
I &apos;m very short .
I know you can make it better .
I don &apos;t play tennis .
Tom is quiet .
I &apos;m reading a book about languages .
Has Tom gone , too ?
The law has been changed .
The explanation is simple .
Do you not like Tom ?
I &apos;ve seen a lot .
How &apos;s Tom going to find Mary ?
We don &apos;t need to do that now .
They don &apos;t talk at all .
I want my children to learn to speak French .
I saw a boy swimming across the river .
Is this the one you saw ?
Tom is helping Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t realize he was in any danger .
I &apos;ve got a good idea .
We &apos;re rich .
Mary and I became good friends .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that again .
Don &apos;t you have anything to say ?
That won &apos;t be possible .
I don &apos;t know why I said that .
Tom could read when he was three .
How did that work ?
There is no one here with that name .
How do you expect me to do all this alone ?
Tom broke out of jail .
Today is a beautiful day .
Tom plays golf every Monday .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s voice .
I want you to get off my back .
We are free from danger .
I &apos;m not married anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
I don &apos;t want to have kids , but I want to get married .
It &apos;s important to Tom .
Does anyone still have a question ?
I understand what you mean .
I &apos;m going to Boston in October .
We &apos;re both from Boston .
Tom will be pleased to see you .
We have to find Tom before the police do .
Could I use your desk ?
I come here as often as I can .
I &apos;m not sure if I can do that .
Were you at the concert ?
We have two children .
I can take the train .
I helped Tom find an apartment .
That girl is Mary .
She gave up everything for her children .
It &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
I told him to leave the room .
I find this difficult to believe .
Tom taught me to read .
How does this camera work ?
Did you come to Boston by bus ?
When do you run ?
Come with me , Tom .
We don &apos;t want to do this .
How high is the mountain ?
What happens now ?
Tom wants Mary to be happy .
Tom knew exactly where Mary was .
Do your best and don &apos;t worry .
Tom is at school , isn &apos;t he ?
The glass dropped from his hand .
I felt that I should help her .
He returned home after being away for ten months .
He needs the money .
I don &apos;t intend to marry him .
I &apos;m asking you as a friend .
Tom is really big .
We had fun .
I brought you some coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to finish her homework so quickly .
I sat down next to Tom .
Everyone left , except for us .
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t here .
She won &apos;t like this .
Tom looks well .
He believes that the story is true .
I listen to the radio every night .
No one can read the book without crying .
He told me that he was hungry .
When did you find this ?
Let &apos;s get together again !
Can you explain why ?
Tom loves going to the beach .
She talked as if she were my mother .
My sister is pretty .
The idea isn &apos;t new .
You should not laugh at his mistake .
Tom is going to make it .
Tom knows where it is .
Tom &apos;s parents weren &apos;t home .
We were looking for Tom .
She is a friend of my wife &apos;s .
Did you find anything in the room ?
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what Mary did .
He left the window open .
I know now what I have to do .
What was Tom doing in Australia last month ?
I &apos;ll give you a call before I come .
You may do whatever you want .
Tom had the right idea .
I &apos;m not mad . I &apos;m just sad .
Everyone had a good time at the party .
You &apos;ll get your money .
The dog is on the chair .
Some animals eat their young .
The village in which he was born is far from here .
I &apos;ll pay for it myself .
I know what it takes .
They don &apos;t care .
Bring your children along .
I &apos;d love to go there one day .
We &apos;re here to help .
I think Tom used to date Mary .
I wonder what Tom is doing now .
What are people saying ?
Tom is in his room listening to music .
Go wait outside .
He did not have enough money .
She wouldn &apos;t be happy with him .
We meet once a month .
He made a bad decision .
This time tomorrow I &apos;ll be studying in the library .
There &apos;s something wrong with this machine .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe I won .
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t speak to you .
I &apos;m not busy either .
No one I know wears a tie anymore .
I don &apos;t have a present for Tom yet .
He fell asleep right away .
I like doing stuff like that .
I &apos;m very worried about you .
Tom was surprised that Mary already knew about what happened .
He is at his desk .
She said that she was ill .
Tom and Mary know the truth .
Do you think it &apos;s my fault ?
How long do I have to stay here ?
Her bike is better than mine .
Do you even care ?
That &apos;ll be my next problem to solve .
I said stop it !
You will not be able to catch the train .
The beginning of the story was interesting .
I don &apos;t understand that at all .
I &apos;m nearly ready .
Tom arrived earlier than usual yesterday .
Do you know what love is ?
Tom got almost everything he needed .
Let &apos;s do what Tom said .
Look what I made .
I want you to drive to Boston .
My apartment is near .
I could do this all day .
The truth is that I can &apos;t speak French at all .
You made the right choice .
Tom almost looks like a girl .
Do you want a drink ?
This plane is his .
No one gave up hope .
I &apos;m not very strong .
I don &apos;t think this is such a good idea .
Tom looks like you .
Do you know that ?
The police are here .
Do you know who lives in that house ?
Tom often wears a hat .
I think we &apos;d better wait another thirty minutes .
Don &apos;t be too hard on me .
Tom is having dinner .
Tom sat on top of his desk , looking out the window .
Tom said he was glad he did that .
He lost face .
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear Mary .
Everything &apos;s better .
Maybe Tom is in love .
Tom was all alone in the house .
Tom gets up at six .
Tom held the door open .
I would &apos;ve liked to do that .
We did nothing wrong .
They don &apos;t understand .
I must leave now .
I &apos;m very good at what I do .
Don &apos;t you like us ?
Give me my money .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to buy Mary for her birthday .
Tom will be back in an hour .
What happened then ?
I believe what is written in her letter .
I &apos;d like to ask you a favor .
He is sure to win .
I really am busy .
I came here to see you .
Tom couldn &apos;t open the door .
The kids are driving me crazy .
I don &apos;t know when Tom left .
Is there a problem I should know about ?
Tom is working on it now .
I haven &apos;t written anything for months .
I think that it &apos;s possible .
He left the office without saying a word to anyone .
He drinks a glass of water every morning .
My sister can swim very fast .
That &apos;s what I think , too .
He &apos;s too old for her .
Will that ever change ?
Tom can understand Mary &apos;s French .
How do you think that makes me feel ?
Tom and Mary were hungry .
I have to open the window .
Tom came to see me three days ago .
Tom had never kissed anyone before .
Did Tom just leave ?
Tom may know why Mary has to do that .
I &apos;m going to give you one last chance .
I don &apos;t know what Tom said .
I &apos;ve got something in my eye .
Tom , I &apos;m hungry .
I seem to have done something wrong .
We don &apos;t want to cause any trouble .
He didn &apos;t want to do it .
I think his name is Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it .
Tom is planning to study abroad next year .
Do your parents know that you &apos;re here ?
Tom has paid the bill .
I have a dog and two cats .
Where is your brother ?
Do you know why ?
I didn &apos;t see her .
I &apos;m here with Tom .
Are you sure you &apos;re well enough to go to school ?
You have ten minutes to make up your mind .
I fell .
That &apos;s the reason he became angry .
They can &apos;t afford it .
Tom was looking for something to eat .
I don &apos;t know my address yet , I &apos;m going to stay with my friend for a while .
I used to drink beer .
Give people what they want .
They know me .
I &apos;m here for Tom .
What do you want to do now ?
I don &apos;t have the time to do that right now .
It &apos;s very quiet here , isn &apos;t it ?
Where are you taking Tom ?
We &apos;ll ask Tom .
All I ate yesterday was one apple .
Tom has been studying all morning .
Was it really worth it ?
They need to find an apartment in the city .
I love you for who you are .
Maybe Tom is in the hospital .
I &apos;ll be back in less than five minutes .
It &apos;s good to talk to you .
Could you tell me how to get to your office ?
Tom is rich , but he isn &apos;t happy .
How &apos;s it coming , Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait that long .
Tom kissed my hand .
I no longer work here .
Tom will know something &apos;s wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom will understand .
I was very rich until I met her .
I have to go back to Boston .
My mother gets up early every morning .
You think I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
I noticed some mistakes in his report .
Why did she come home early ?
Did Tom have dinner ?
You had no reason to do that .
I &apos;m impressed , Tom .
Tom was alone in the room .
That &apos;s a school .
Don &apos;t blame Tom .
How long will you be staying ?
I think Tom is afraid of you .
Tom was supposed to be here .
What did you eat for lunch today ?
Tom won &apos;t be at school today .
I must say I &apos;m quite impressed .
I don &apos;t live in Boston .
Tom is doing what he loves .
Tom knew I was ready .
Tom can &apos;t lend Mary any money right now .
The only time my son talks to me is when he needs some money .
She promised that she would pay me this week , but she didn &apos;t keep her word .
Let &apos;s go out to eat .
Why are you being so kind ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like me much .
Do you think it likely ?
You still haven &apos;t told me why you decided not to go .
How are you and Tom getting along ?
I just don &apos;t believe it .
I will study abroad when I have finished school .
Tom talked about his feelings .
Do you enjoy living like this ?
We met at a party .
Tom knew Mary would like John .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have said that .
Tom is hiding from Mary .
He is my father .
Tom wasn &apos;t quiet .
No one could solve the problem .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary to do that .
Would you like to have some coffee ?
I &apos;m only interested in the truth .
Tom seems to be tired .
Tom is telling a story .
We &apos;ll go a week from today .
That &apos;s all we know for sure .
I took a picture of her .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll rain this afternoon .
He &apos;s right behind me .
How come you didn &apos;t tell me Tom was going to Boston with us ?
Tom said he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
I &apos;ve only spoken to Tom once .
Mary and I plan to have two children .
I heard that Tom kissed Mary .
Tom knows all about Mary .
What are they doing there ?
I plan to live to be a hundred .
That &apos;s where Tom lives .
I want to know what this is called .
We have to start at once .
You can &apos;t do anything right now .
Tom lives near me .
I had my car stolen last night .
Is your mom home ?
I understand you .
Give it up .
Tom wants to learn how to dance .
Is Tom drunk ?
This makes her angry .
I met him at the station .
When are you coming back home ?
Where are your friends going ?
I don &apos;t want to be you .
I &apos;m very happy here .
I &apos;m new in town .
Do you really want Tom on your team ?
It was Tom &apos;s fault .
Tom has told me a lot about you .
Tom works very hard , but not as hard as Mary .
I need a lawyer who can speak French .
I think that &apos;s too expensive .
Tom tried to leave .
I won &apos;t die .
Tom is never here in the morning .
I can &apos;t say .
We should try and get some sleep .
That boy is Tom .
I haven &apos;t forgotten you .
We happened to meet at the station .
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were , but that &apos;s not going to happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t like eggs .
This needs to be done by Monday .
I promised him that I would come today .
Your hat is somewhere around here .
Tom is really quiet .
Tom ate his dinner .
We don &apos;t want to do that here .
When did you go to bed last night ?
I &apos;ll go to Tokyo by train .
Tom wants his children to learn French .
He also speaks French .
Do you like them ?
Tom doesn &apos;t work here .
Can I help ?
She likes to run .
Tom just turned thirty years old .
It &apos;s not about the money , is it ?
I &apos;ll stand by you no matter what others may say .
The boy ran away .
I have to do something .
May I ask your name ?
I will get it for you .
They &apos;re friends of yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom isn &apos;t very funny .
You &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than I have .
My son came to my room .
He was so tired that he could hardly stand .
Why are you going there ?
I want to know why I &apos;m here .
We &apos;re still here .
You &apos;re not eating very much . What &apos;s wrong ?
I did everything all by myself .
I asked him to start at once .
He &apos;s three years older than she is .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have to do anything .
What kind of food do you like to eat ?
Take whatever you want .
I &apos;m not going to Boston .
Look at my arm .
Tom seems very interested .
Tom made it home OK .
Tom likes girls .
I &apos;m going to spend the evening with Tom .
How &apos;s Tom &apos;s cold ?
Tom speaks slowly .
I &apos;m bored .
Why don &apos;t you take off your coat ?
What are you going to do with those ?
Tom wasn &apos;t OK .
I don &apos;t like cold weather .
I &apos;ve already eaten lunch .
I &apos;m disappointed .
I &apos;ve just arrived .
I don &apos;t want to give up right now .
I am not used to drinking coffee without sugar .
The game isn &apos;t over yet .
You &apos;re very lonely .
You don &apos;t need to do it right away .
Is that your sister ?
Tom is coming , too .
Can I open my eyes now ?
I have a horse .
Did Tom like Boston ?
She loves Tom more than I do .
Let &apos;s not forget we never could have done this without Tom &apos;s help .
I like this job .
We &apos;re home .
This is my car .
That &apos;s water under the bridge .
I &apos;ll explain it to Tom .
Don &apos;t you know his name ?
The TV doesn &apos;t work .
Tom is the only student at this school that Mary knows .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem like himself .
Just be yourself .
This dress is too big for me .
These are my shoes and those are yours .
I thought we were going to go somewhere .
You are not at all what I expected .
He will be back in an hour .
Tom did exactly as he was told .
That &apos;s a really good idea .
All the boys in class worked hard .
Tom is old enough to drink .
Can we wait for Tom here ?
Tom is the father of three children .
Do you want me to go without you ?
I can give it a shot .
Christmas is just three weeks from now .
The room is too small to play in .
Tom is going to like this .
I waited all day , but Tom never came .
I want you .
Tom is about half Mary &apos;s age .
If I were in your place , I would lend him a hand .
It &apos;s gotten better .
Perhaps you &apos;re right .
I didn &apos;t see anyone studying .
Thank you for giving this to me .
She became happy .
Tell Tom I don &apos;t like him .
My clock seems to be broken .
Tom is still just a boy .
Tom wants to marry me .
I wrote it for Tom .
Tom seemed busy .
Just tell me what happened .
Tom seldom gets mad .
Tom left school an hour ago .
Tom was in the kitchen .
Tom seems very happy .
Is breakfast ready ?
That was great .
Tom was stupid enough to believe what Mary said .
Tom looks good .
It is five minutes to nine .
I know what you did in Australia .
You &apos;ve got my phone .
There isn &apos;t any hope .
That rarely happens .
Tom takes me to school .
This money is mine .
You &apos;re not supposed to do that , you know .
Is someone there ?
She is now on vacation .
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him .
He keeps two cats .
Do you know how to speak French ?
How hard can this be ?
I had no idea Tom was a doctor .
I &apos;m just doing my job .
Tom made Mary wash his car .
I &apos;ll pay you .
You have to call Tom .
Tom could &apos;ve and should &apos;ve helped Mary .
What do you like to eat for lunch ?
Tom &apos;s family is here .
He is one of my old friends .
I really thought Tom liked me .
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the office .
I think I might be able to be there by 2 : 30 .
I do not know if it is love .
Do you really enjoy doing that kind of thing ?
I have to go to sleep .
Here &apos;s Tom &apos;s picture .
He can &apos;t help you .
My father likes pizza very much .
I wish I hadn &apos;t done that .
I &apos;ve been working here for three years .
He kept me waiting .
It is time to go to school .
Are you in on this ?
This should be interesting .
She was kind enough to help me .
Tom came here .
It &apos;s not too much .
Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
Tom lives in an old building .
That would be fine .
I &apos;m not giving up on Tom .
Don &apos;t break up with me .
Something has happened to this clock .
Are you going to come ?
I &apos;m happy tonight .
I get paid to do that .
This is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
I wonder where Tom could &apos;ve gone .
I &apos;m very happy to see you .
Tom is reading the newspaper .
I wanted people to like me .
Tom loves coffee .
We will visit them soon .
I saw Tom die .
Children should drink milk every day .
What does he mean to do ?
Tom was surprised how well Mary could swim .
It &apos;s not a problem .
I lost the watch .
I remember both of you .
Your mother loves me .
I found something I thought I &apos;d lost .
How many times have you been to Europe ?
I &apos;m a little child .
I think this book is very good .
Tom is fun to play with .
Nobody wants him to come .
I speak French much better than Tom does .
The trip will take at least five days .
I need to speak with you right away .
I need to get a job .
I saw Tom three weeks ago .
Tom has been in the hospital for a long time .
I &apos;m going to miss Tom .
Is Tom still married to Mary ?
Do you have enough money ?
You don &apos;t know what he told me .
I can hardly believe his story .
Tom came into the room .
He has a large house and two cars .
Could you please translate this for me ?
What day are you usually free ?
I just saw Tom and Mary together .
We want you here .
Tom wants to be with Mary .
Tom said he enjoyed the party .
I did that right away .
Tom said he had to go somewhere .
How far did Tom go ?
I &apos;m sorry , I have no idea .
Tom and Mary are friends with John .
Tom is a good person .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know that .
He is pleased with his new shoes .
I don &apos;t have a family .
Why don &apos;t you come over after school today ?
I won &apos;t give up , no matter what you say .
There is always something happening here .
Tom seemed to have many friends .
Have you ever heard Tom sing ?
Could you take our picture ?
Thanks for your explanation .
That &apos;s really stupid .
Do you feel like eating something ?
Do you want to make me happy ?
I forgot to ask him .
I started working for this company last year .
I spent the weekend with my friends .
We &apos;ve got to be careful .
Tom has money , but I don &apos;t .
The boy reading a book is Tom .
He was fast asleep .
This isn &apos;t necessary .
I should &apos;ve gone to Boston with Tom .
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to Boston with me .
Call Tom .
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon .
I can &apos;t take Tom &apos;s money .
I missed the last train .
Why is Tom studying French ?
His father eats there twice a week .
Don &apos;t let that dog come near me !
You can take your time .
Who is your teacher ?
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
Tom brought his dog to school .
We &apos;re here because we want to talk to Tom .
Your daughter isn &apos;t a girl anymore .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t find a job .
It looks like snow , doesn &apos;t it ?
You &apos;re a good man .
We &apos;d better go help Tom .
She isn &apos;t my sister , she &apos;s my wife .
I have to get back to Boston .
We &apos;ve got a long night ahead of us .
What are you doing Sunday ?
There &apos;s somebody I want to talk to first .
Where did you first meet ?
I &apos;m going to leave one night early .
What would you do if I weren &apos;t here ?
I don &apos;t live in the city .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
I can &apos;t do it right now .
It was seven thirty .
Please tell us something about yourself .
Tom had a good idea .
She isn &apos;t lonely anymore .
I know you &apos;re trying very hard .
I was in Australia all last month .
You &apos;re pretty good at that .
We have to buy it from abroad .
The boy talks as if he were a man .
Tom can &apos;t really help us much .
I don &apos;t believe everything Tom says .
The problem is what we should do with this money .
Tom sent money home .
That is a very good question .
I learned today that Tom doesn &apos;t like me . Do you know why ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything .
I could not sleep well last night , because it was so hot .
Tom wasn &apos;t at school yesterday .
I don &apos;t want to marry Tom .
You must help us .
Tom and I are looking for Mary .
Tom is very quiet .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to stay at home .
Don &apos;t worry about the baby .
He is much older than he looks .
I &apos;ve been asking myself that same question .
I know the story from beginning to end .
You &apos;ve done a great job .
What is the story ?
Have you told your mother ?
They wouldn &apos;t tell me the truth .
Is Tom good at swimming ?
Tom doesn &apos;t remember exactly what happened .
Tom needs our help .
That could &apos;ve gone better .
Are you sure that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
I can &apos;t live without a TV .
He works eight hours a day .
An accident has happened .
I enjoyed watching the movie .
I still do that .
Tom likes writing .
I &apos;ve already spoken with Tom .
I put some milk in my coffee .
Tom ran to school .
I wish I hadn &apos;t kissed you .
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
We can &apos;t find Tom .
I &apos;d like to see you .
Tom knew that Mary loved John .
We want to go .
You are very smart .
I wonder if something has happened .
May I start eating now ?
It &apos;s for you to decide .
Are you planning to stay ?
She is a friend of mine .
How do you know about this ?
I asked Tom to come .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything about himself .
You &apos;ll love Australia .
It &apos;s very hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
Everybody made fun of me .
She is , if anything , a little better today than yesterday .
That &apos;s a picture of Tom and his cat .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
I like women .
It was too late .
I love tea .
I &apos;m coming home , Tom .
Tom is happy to be alive .
What happened on the bus ?
I am not sure .
Don &apos;t play dead .
Tom won &apos;t care .
Tom might know .
It is difficult for me to answer the question .
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat .
I agree with both of you .
I know what Tom is likely to do .
I don &apos;t owe anyone anything .
I spent the whole day thinking about Tom .
I want to learn .
I love talking to you .
How would you help Tom ?
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself .
Have I changed that much ?
Do you want to know where you made your mistake ?
How long have Tom and Mary been going out together ?
I don &apos;t care what you think .
She could not swim .
What time did you go to bed last night ?
We both saw you .
Do you still have it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you here .
Tom came home very late .
He &apos;ll come on foot or by bicycle .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was asleep .
I looked at Tom .
Why do you do what you do ?
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever .
He must be dead .
Tom is young .
What are the animals that you can see in this picture ?
I think what you say is true .
I &apos;m better off without you .
I can &apos;t live without her .
I know what &apos;s up .
Where did you see Tom ?
I am hungry because I did not eat lunch .
How does this work ?
What a woman !
I wrote the song for her .
Don &apos;t you want to know what it means ?
He should have worked harder .
Tom and I are the same age .
There were no more apples in the box .
Tom said I shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
Who closed the window ?
I don &apos;t worry about mistakes .
Tom is out to get me .
I think Tom didn &apos;t like the food .
He wrote a letter .
Why do you want to talk to Tom ?
They haven &apos;t come back home yet .
Why haven &apos;t you told Tom about what happened last night ?
I can &apos;t swim at all .
Tom lived in Boston for a long time .
I want to know how this happened and why .
He loves us .
I have a solution in mind .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
I said we aren &apos;t going to do it .
I &apos;ve been busy this week .
Will you let Tom do that ?
Tom will be here any minute now .
This is too hard a problem for me to solve .
Do you have a question ?
I wish we &apos;d met earlier .
I think I &apos;ve broken my arm .
What &apos;ll happen to us now ?
I must learn French .
I like this book better than that one .
Tom advised me not to speak French .
I have nothing to do now .
Most women think like that .
We &apos;re not home .
Tom isn &apos;t as young as I am .
Tom may have seen it .
They all say that .
You must think of your family .
They never did anything .
People believe what they want to believe .
Tom tried to contact Mary .
You can &apos;t use that .
That is the exactly the same idea as I have .
Do you know anyone here ?
I only look like Tom . I &apos;m not Tom .
Are you at home ?
I loved my life and my money .
Can I eat ?
I found out where Tom used to live .
We don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
Tom has something to do with the case .
Please tell me where we &apos;re going .
I want something with which to write .
I hope he isn &apos;t ill .
This is quite new to me .
You can tell me the truth .
It &apos;s too good to be true .
All you need is to get a driver &apos;s license .
Who are you ?
You look good without your glasses on .
This table doesn &apos;t fit well here .
Tom didn &apos;t see me .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
Tom loved to sing , but nobody wanted to listen to his singing .
You know what this is , don &apos;t you ?
You must have made a mistake .
I hear what you &apos;re saying .
I &apos;ll give you this .
This is a picture of my mother .
Tom drank beer .
Tom has a lot of friends now .
There &apos;s no one sitting here .
Have you read Tom &apos;s book ?
I think they know you .
He seems as busy as ever .
They lost again .
Where is your school ?
No one will believe you .
What kind of work do you like ?
He is walking very slowly .
Tom opened his suitcase .
Tom knew what Mary knew .
Tom is older than Mary .
Tom can change .
You know what you have to do .
I &apos;m very impressed .
Do you think so ?
Do you want money ?
Do you do this every day ?
They aren &apos;t dead .
My sister has a piano .
Are you saying you don &apos;t want to go ?
It &apos;s just a piece of paper .
I &apos;m sorry . I don &apos;t have a lot of time .
He gave me a watch .
Have you heard what I said ?
Don &apos;t you like Tom ?
I didn &apos;t expect Tom to do anything .
I &apos;d like to know what happened to Tom .
Look out for Tom .
Tom and Mary kissed each other more than once .
We are happy to see you again .
I &apos;d like to see someone do better .
Just act as if nothing has happened .
I think Tom wants to stay .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t have to .
You must tell us .
I know exactly who it is .
Tom has a picture of his dog on his desk .
Tom lived in Boston .
We &apos;ll take care of that later .
This is wrong .
Tom talked .
Don &apos;t make fun of them .
Do you think we &apos;ll have good weather ?
Tom was the only person in the room at the time .
Tom has my car .
Do you guys want something to eat ?
It is raining .
Tom went to Boston three days ago .
We met last night .
She doesn &apos;t speak my language .
Tom said that he was going to help .
It would be crazy to do that again .
Tom waited for more than an hour .
I go to work .
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened ?
Tom is looking for someone .
How deep is the lake ?
I &apos;ve got good news for you , Tom .
Maybe we already have enough money to buy a house .
I believe that Tom loves me .
Mary likes watching TV .
Is Tom dead yet ?
Can you stay a bit longer ?
The man entered the next room .
What is this letter ?
I can &apos;t let Tom go alone .
This novel is interesting enough .
I don &apos;t eat fish .
I don &apos;t want you to be late .
Tom seems to be much taller than he used to be .
That tall man over there is Tom .
It is impossible .
Can you tell me how to get to the station ?
What did you learn at school today ?
I &apos;ll do what needs to be done .
Tom knows that he has to do that .
Don &apos;t close your eyes .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here .
This pair of shoes doesn &apos;t fit me .
He looks much better now .
We &apos;ll call you .
I &apos;d like some more bread , please .
He got angry .
Tom knew how important doing that was to me .
Is that what you want to do ?
I never did that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to do that .
Tom is waiting for you to say something .
This is Tom &apos;s car .
He &apos;s very good at playing baseball .
We &apos;ll wait here .
It seems like we have to go now .
I spend less money on clothes than my sister does .
They say that she &apos;ll get married soon .
Stop that !
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d been waiting a long time .
You look like your mother .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents anymore .
Tom wants to become famous .
Let &apos;s not forget the real reason we &apos;re here .
The girl is small for her age .
I &apos;ll cook you whatever you want .
Tom may die .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want anything .
The baby is sleeping .
Why can &apos;t we just be friends ?
I left my umbrella on the bus .
I &apos;m sure Tom won &apos;t mind .
Are you feeling better today ?
Even though he was sick , he went to school .
Tom isn &apos;t here yet .
Tom is too young to drink .
I think it &apos;s true .
You &apos;re a man now .
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s friend , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom didn &apos;t care .
He died before I arrived .
You &apos;re going to have to do that .
My dog died last winter .
Could you close the window , please ?
I &apos;ll wait for you in the car .
Tom kept writing .
You know better .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s .
He who knows several languages gets more from the world .
Your face is red .
Is Tom still up ?
Tom dropped his glass .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether what Mary says is true or not .
He promised me he wouldn &apos;t tell anyone .
That &apos;s what I thought , too .
You know what you said .
I think she &apos;ll help me .
I want to go with you to the movies .
How did you find us ?
Tom loved his family and friends .
I will read a book .
Tom wasn &apos;t as surprised as I was .
What do you think I did ?
I hope Tom isn &apos;t confused .
Tom sounds nice .
That &apos;s a very good car .
Everything &apos;s going to be OK .
I have an idea she will come today .
She said that she was happy .
I visited her in Germany .
I &apos;m OK with that .
That may easily have been a mistake .
I would do anything for Tom .
Give me something to drink .
Tom is no longer a boy .
He can swim fast .
What did you want to see me about ?
I &apos;m sorry , but he is out now .
I can &apos;t carry this suitcase . It &apos;s too heavy .
Tom said that he lost his key .
Do you smoke ?
All I really want is to be left alone .
I &apos;ll be in the car .
You won &apos;t believe who I just saw .
My camera is the same as your camera .
People don &apos;t say that anymore .
Do you know if Tom is here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live far away .
Tom liked it .
The family ate dinner together .
I can &apos;t believe that we &apos;re really here .
Tom was like a father to me .
I don &apos;t understand French .
Tom has a girl back home .
I &apos;m going to make it .
Are you rich ?
I looked at the picture .
All of the students at our school study French .
Leave me alone !
Tom is seldom late .
We agree .
Is what you said about Tom really true ?
Tom received help .
They know what happened .
I &apos;ll always love you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
My friend has a large family .
Tom has a cold .
Let &apos;s not ever do this again .
Tom hurt his leg and can barely walk .
Tom was completely confused .
He is in the kitchen .
You don &apos;t want this .
That &apos;s what I want most .
Tom must &apos;ve told us the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks to his children .
We haven &apos;t met yet .
I wonder if Tom can hear us .
We must work as long as we live .
I don &apos;t know what you want to do .
I don &apos;t like the way you &apos;re talking to me .
Tom is the only person who can help me .
Do you study French at school ?
He was all alone in the house .
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow .
Tom and Mary have a few kids , but I &apos;m not sure how many .
If it had not been for his help , I would have failed .
What was your mother doing when you got home ?
That room is not very large .
Are you in Boston ?
You are not to leave this room .
You can wait in this room .
He &apos;s all right .
They don &apos;t know me .
Tom wanted me out of the house , so I left .
I want Tom to be safe .
I like you a lot .
Could you please move out of my way ?
You must stay awake .
I &apos;ll let someone else deal with it .
I &apos;m not young anymore .
How did you come up with that answer ?
Let &apos;s try to find a way to help Tom .
Tom has finished .
Tom will be absent today .
Can you tell us a joke ?
She has gone to America .
I never promised you anything .
I didn &apos;t think Tom was in Boston .
Is this car new ?
She did not agree to the proposal .
Her brother is married , but he doesn &apos;t have children .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t believe that Mary would really do that .
It &apos;s early .
How long is the bridge ?
Get ready for school .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with you .
Tom always talks about himself .
Tom said that he &apos;ll leave the door open .
Tom didn &apos;t stay in Australia .
Tom always thinks he &apos;s right .
We had no choice but to call the police last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink a lot .
Do you know who Tom killed ?
Do you have them ?
I &apos;m a little upset .
Tom doesn &apos;t have an office .
No one is saying that .
I am too busy to go .
Tom thinks he &apos;s in love .
I told Tom that I would do my best .
Let &apos;s ask him .
Are you absolutely sure ?
I loved that movie when I was a kid .
Tom is my father .
Tom can &apos;t see without his glasses .
I don &apos;t eat any bread .
What am I going to do about Tom ?
I don &apos;t remember you .
He doesn &apos;t come here every day .
Now my daughter is afraid of me .
This box is filled with apples .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy .
You &apos;re so lucky to have a husband like that .
I know that Tom does that every morning .
Tom ate it .
Are you through with your homework ?
Tom lost weight very quickly .
You &apos;re very funny .
Tom smiled to himself .
Tom has long hair .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom knows what to say .
We &apos;ll be back after the break .
The room was empty .
Tom doesn &apos;t belong here .
Tom never should &apos;ve told Mary that he loved her .
I can &apos;t save you .
He left his wife and children .
I &apos;m not worried about it .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me anything about it ?
I would do that right now if I were you .
If that happens again , I &apos;ll leave .
Tom sounds disappointed .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in weeks .
I &apos;ll listen to you .
Tom kissed Mary , not Alice .
You &apos;re not the only Canadian here .
It was Tom &apos;s idea to try it this way .
I &apos;ll never forget you .
I left my umbrella on the train .
Tom , what do you think ?
Whose house is across from yours ?
Tom lives alone in a large house .
Tom went into the house .
What were you doing out here ?
I don &apos;t drink beer .
She has many dogs .
I answered the phone .
I &apos;m very happy with it .
Everybody knows the news .
China is a large country .
Did you get me anything ?
I have Tom here with me .
We want to know what happened to Tom .
You really should talk to Tom .
All is calm tonight .
Tom is good at writing .
Today , we are going dancing .
It &apos;s not important .
Tom seemed to be ill .
Tom may come here .
I want you to read this book .
I wish Tom were here now .
Tom got off his horse .
I can &apos;t go to work today .
Tom may have to do that .
What do I owe ?
Tom said that he had eaten lunch with his friends .
I want to see it .
Where do you see the books ?
Is there anything else you want me to do ?
It &apos;s just that simple .
I didn &apos;t know you had company .
We have to find it before Tom does .
She has three kids .
That was enough .
My family &apos;s going to love you .
Tom was the one who wrote this story .
Give me a glass of milk .
I ran for my life .
Tom has gone for the day .
We are going to have a baby .
You won &apos;t need that .
Will you be home for dinner ?
Give it to me , Tom .
What he said made us angry .
That boy won &apos;t tell me his name .
I used to eat pizza , but now I don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll give you thirty dollars for that .
That happens a lot here .
My father may be at home now .
We have more apples than we could eat in a day .
I didn &apos;t know how to answer his question .
How does this look ?
What is it ?
The couple lived a happy life to the end .
I want some water .
I did want that to happen .
How do we get back home from here ?
Tom &apos;s mother always told him he should eat more vegetables .
I &apos;m reading it .
I knew Tom wasn &apos;t going to change .
I want to drink a cup of tea .
Everybody knows who you are .
Are you the one who wrote this ?
I can &apos;t remember your name .
I &apos;ve never met anybody like you .
You haven &apos;t changed .
I like this better than that .
Is it OK if I go home now ?
I said I &apos;d get it .
That &apos;s not the right answer .
The room has been empty for a long time .
That means a lot to me .
We &apos;re afraid .
I &apos;m worried about the baby .
Everyone loves him .
I &apos;d better see him .
It &apos;s already late .
I waited for her for one hour .
This is going to be fun .
I think that what you need now is to eat something .
I came here with my mom .
We need water .
May I ask you to do me a favor ?
He took something out of his pocket .
My clock is five minutes fast .
You &apos;re so beautiful .
Tom is very close to his girlfriend &apos;s family .
Tom , please be careful .
I can do without it .
I want you to call the police .
That bicycle is too small for you .
Paris will always be Paris .
I am a student in a university .
They &apos;re just doing their job .
Is that even a real word ?
I felt lonely .
These people are anything but innocent .
Look after yourself .
What are you doing this weekend ?
Tom has a thing for Mary .
Everything that Tom said is true .
Tom wants us to think he &apos;s happy .
What does it mean ?
Did Tom actually say that ?
I like walking alone .
Where did you say this came from ?
Do you like tennis ?
My uncle lives in Germany .
I can try it .
Tom asked Mary when the last time she had bought a book was .
She wants to kiss him .
It &apos;s to the point .
Tom is at home almost every evening .
You &apos;d better give up smoking .
How old is that dog ?
What about this one ?
These keys are not mine .
Tom smiled at Mary when she came into the room .
She &apos;s not a doctor .
I &apos;m not like you .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary the whole truth .
She laughed so hard she cried .
I just couldn &apos;t do it .
Did you get in trouble ?
I &apos;ve let everybody down .
Tom had never been to Boston before .
Tom said that he thought that he &apos;d be able to do that today .
Give Tom a call .
You &apos;re just the person we need .
Tom and Mary live near the library .
You didn &apos;t call me .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to do that .
He said that he would help me .
I &apos;m going with Tom to Boston .
I &apos;m rather impressed .
Tom made a dress for Mary .
I thought Tom had already tried to do that .
He can &apos;t tell what is written on the paper .
She likes to walk alone .
You should go to bed early .
Tom was still in Boston this time last year .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom speaks good French .
I &apos;m glad you were right .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait long .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Is this what I think it is ?
Let him pay for it .
Tom is here in Boston with me .
Tom was Mary &apos;s first love .
Please do it quickly .
The man stood up and began to sing .
Are they in love ?
We &apos;ll cook .
I have to get Tom .
It was a long time since I &apos;ve done that .
Who is playing the guitar ?
Tom left Mary behind .
Stop doing that , Tom .
Who &apos;ll look after your dog tomorrow ?
Tom suddenly started to cry .
Why don &apos;t we get going ?
I think that we should try again .
You like French , don &apos;t you ?
I wish you didn &apos;t do that .
He wants to learn how to cook .
I have to go . There &apos;s someone waiting for me .
Who will come with me ?
It &apos;s fine with me .
I was in bed already .
Tom only did that once .
Could I talk to you for a minute ?
Everything here is mine .
How long have Tom and Mary been married ?
She is as beautiful as ever .
I have a different opinion .
Tom thinks Mary knows .
His English is better than mine .
Tom drove to Mary &apos;s house .
I like writing .
We can worry about the other problems later .
How many do you need ?
I need to find someone who can help me .
I want to tell you one thing more .
I &apos;m very glad I wasn &apos;t there .
I thought Tom could help .
Is your uncle still abroad ?
Will she come ?
I &apos;m going to get you , Tom .
My grandfather died in the same room in which he was born .
Did you give it to him last year ?
I can &apos;t agree with you on this matter .
What a big house you have !
Let &apos;s have dinner .
No one is there but Tom .
Tom , if you &apos;re not going I &apos;m not going either .
What made you ask that ?
I want to know where Tom lives .
It was a complete success .
Can you do this ?
I won &apos;t be able to sleep tonight .
You &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom said Mary was happy .
I made a mistake .
There are still a lot of things to do .
This is the big one .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all of Mary &apos;s questions .
She did not keep her promise to write to me .
I have to go talk to Tom .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s family .
It &apos;s getting late and I have to get up early tomorrow .
You know French , don &apos;t you ?
I know all of them .
I should &apos;ve done that yesterday .
Tom likes her .
He has no house in which to live .
How are you these days ?
Will Tom leave early ?
Why would Tom want to help us ?
I &apos;m rather busy .
That is out of the question .
Tom was too tired to study .
Tom took a taxi to the station .
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off .
She is expecting a child .
Do you have a big family ?
The water is cold .
I &apos;m trying to eat more vegetables .
Your name wouldn &apos;t be Tom , by any chance , would it ?
You need a key .
My dream has come true .
Tom said something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
I don &apos;t understand this at all .
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine .
You aren &apos;t me .
A Japanese would never do such a thing .
Tom says he &apos;ll call Mary next week .
You look busy .
You should ask Tom first .
That &apos;s how I like things .
Are you really that busy ?
Tom was working at his desk all morning .
Tom can &apos;t be under thirty .
You can go anywhere you like .
Our team won the game .
We &apos;ve got a big problem .
Tom &apos;s guilty .
Tom hardly ever does that anymore .
Can &apos;t we talk about this later ?
How would you say it ?
I think that my suitcase was stolen .
This isn &apos;t over .
There &apos;s still a fair bit of work to be done .
I don &apos;t have a key .
He must have seen it .
You don &apos;t have to answer those questions .
I wrote to Tom .
He is always reading .
Here I am .
Tom &apos;s shy .
Tom just sat there saying nothing .
He is my brother .
I hate when that happens .
What do you want to be when you grow up ?
Tom stayed there for three days .
I didn &apos;t know that she was ill .
How bad is Tom hurt ?
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;ll live .
Tom loved it .
I know him very well .
I never hear anything .
I eat everything .
Tom and Mary are very old friends .
Tom was standing in front of Mary &apos;s house .
I &apos;m not sure why .
That &apos;s what you do , isn &apos;t it ?
I told you to be here on time this morning .
I still have a few minutes .
It &apos;s not going to be that easy .
You may laugh at me .
His sister looks young .
Let &apos;s talk about this later .
Tom said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
I knew he was rich , but I didn &apos;t think he was that rich .
What Tom really wanted was to be happy .
I came to see you .
It makes me very happy .
It seemed that no one was in the village .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like this .
How did you learn to dance so well ?
If you don &apos;t tell Tom what happened , I will .
I don &apos;t believe that .
What would happen if you didn &apos;t do what Tom told you to ?
She came out of the room .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of water .
Please call before you come .
I don &apos;t want to go out with Tom .
It was a mistake .
Tom likes them both .
I want to show you something .
You may go anywhere you like .
Tom got married three days ago .
I &apos;ll go to Boston with Tom .
I &apos;m sorry for you .
Is Monday OK ?
Tom walked into his apartment .
Tom &apos;ll stay .
Why is he hiding ?
I &apos;m back .
Everyone went to sleep .
This medicine will do you good !
The movie wasn &apos;t as interesting as I expected it to be .
I don &apos;t go out much anymore .
It would probably be a good idea .
I eat bread .
I was just talking about you .
Tom might know why Mary has to do that .
Are you still mad at me ?
I &apos;m happy and satisfied .
I wish I could swim .
You &apos;re doing that very well .
That &apos;s nothing new .
The cup was empty .
She is as poor as ever .
What did she teach you ?
Where is the station ?
Leave out this word .
I would like to travel around the world .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
They want to know about Tom .
Who will look after the baby ?
Why is Tom looking at us ?
I only told you what Tom told me .
I don &apos;t think Tom will be here on time .
Get ready quickly .
Tom felt great .
Tom is the only boy in his class .
How do you think Tom does it ?
I hope it &apos;s not too late .
Tom knows that everything Mary is saying is true .
What a good idea !
I believe that I can trust you .
You &apos;re the best brother in the whole world .
Did that really just happen ?
I don &apos;t know why I did that .
Tom said that he &apos;s sorry .
The old man died last week .
Tom can &apos;t have done it by himself .
She died after she had been ill for a long time .
Am I allowed to use this ?
Tom may not want to do that , but he should .
I &apos;ve got the keys .
Tom never thought about the future .
What makes you think Tom isn &apos;t a Canadian ?
I want another cup of tea .
We need to take Tom home .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice wasn &apos;t pretty .
I am going to play tennis .
It was a good idea .
Here &apos;s what we know .
Tom is after me .
Tom isn &apos;t going to understand .
She is not afraid of anything .
Tom put an arm around Mary .
I wish I had known the truth .
I don &apos;t like Christmas anymore .
How many times do I have to tell you ?
I have to be back home by seven .
Is his name really Tom ?
Bring your computer .
I &apos;m at home almost every night .
A man is known by the company he keeps .
Which house do you live in ?
You really know your stuff , Tom .
Is Tom alone ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough time to finish his homework .
I &apos;m prepared to die .
He doesn &apos;t live far away .
That was sweet of you .
I don &apos;t like coffee with sugar .
This problem is too difficult for me to explain .
Tom works alone .
I just wanted you to know that .
Were you telling the truth ?
Someone is at the door .
Tom said Mary doesn &apos;t have to do that this week .
I arrived this afternoon .
You &apos;re not coming , are you ?
Can someone explain how this always happens ?
What do you think I think ?
I &apos;m afraid Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
Perhaps that would be possible .
I already said no .
You can &apos;t mean that .
I &apos;ve completely forgotten his name .
Since Tom was speaking in French , I couldn &apos;t understand what he was saying .
You should learn French .
I just heard from Tom .
Mary really looks pretty today .
Tom asked Mary some questions that she couldn &apos;t answer .
Can I dance here ?
Go there yourself .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn &apos;t as hungry as everyone else .
If anyone can do it , you can .
I need someone to talk to Tom .
Tom says that Mary can go , but that he can &apos;t .
How can I contact Tom ?
Tom got along with everybody .
I like to eat apples .
What &apos;s the good news ?
We &apos;re going with you .
Tom and Mary go to church every Sunday .
He does not take care of his children .
We won &apos;t be doing that .
Let Tom drive .
I can &apos;t live with you anymore .
I have been in Japan for two months .
I am eating an apple .
I &apos;m happy with this .
That won &apos;t be hard to do .
What do you see here ?
Tom and I both want to go to Boston .
How do we get out of here ?
I don &apos;t quite know what to say .
She likes to go walking by herself .
I &apos;m not playing with you .
I &apos;ve never been there myself .
You know where I live .
She &apos;d like him to come to her house at 2 : 30 .
You need to wake up .
Where did you eat ?
Is there a message ?
You have to come with us .
You are doing very well . Keep it up .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that .
A great deal has happened while you &apos;ve been away .
She &apos;s not here .
He is one of my best friends .
We are in the same class .
I should just go home .
Do you think Tom knows what &apos;s going on ?
Did you give it to Tom ?
Tom hates Mary as much as she hates him .
I &apos;m not going to say it twice .
Tom is no longer a student here .
That looks like tea .
Tom can help you .
Is there anyone you didn &apos;t tell ?
Tom seemed quite surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married .
Today , I &apos;m not going to school .
This is not a sentence .
Tom is around thirty years old .
Your jokes aren &apos;t funny .
Just do what Tom says .
Tom is with Mary .
She is said to have been beautiful .
Your French is hard to understand .
He left three days ago .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
Tom will definitely come .
These are very big apples .
He can play tennis .
Tom wants me to do that for him .
Where &apos;s my suitcase ?
I can &apos;t pay you . Are you still willing to help ?
You don &apos;t have to worry about a thing like that .
We shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
Tom hasn &apos;t made up his mind yet .
That has nothing to do with you .
This house is very small .
Don &apos;t feel sorry for Tom .
Tom likes reading books .
I &apos;ll always remember you .
This house is quite small .
It won &apos;t come to that .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure whether he should kiss Mary or not , so he didn &apos;t .
I &apos;m afraid we have a problem .
I &apos;ve just finished reading that book .
Turn off the radio .
What a big ship that is !
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe Mary would really do that .
I don &apos;t want to be your enemy .
Something must be done !
Thank you for that .
I am not a doctor .
Tom speaks French well .
Maybe she knows the answer .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy here .
I &apos;ve never seen one like that .
We &apos;d like you to come with us .
I want these .
He was not feeling well .
Have you ever missed a plane ?
They were very confused .
That &apos;s what Tom said to Mary .
Tom and Mary were lucky kids .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is here .
I can &apos;t live this way anymore .
I &apos;m glad I watched the game .
He can read .
I hope so , too .
I didn &apos;t realize it had gotten so late .
Do you know what I like ?
I have no home .
I knew your father well .
What &apos;re you thinking ?
Tom can play tennis better than anyone else here .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to remember Mary .
I almost missed the train .
Tom is a man of few words .
Tom wanted to stay at home .
Go wash your hands .
I saw Tom dancing with another girl .
I heard something .
Is there a garden in front of the house ?
That &apos;s not Tom . That &apos;s John .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better .
He waited for him until 10 .
My mother has gone shopping .
I think Tom should do that .
I don &apos;t know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
I saw Tom kiss Mary .
I said there was nothing we could do .
You were in love with Tom , weren &apos;t you ?
He sold us out .
How are things ?
The car he &apos;s driving is not his .
She has never visited him .
I promised Tom I wouldn &apos;t say anything .
Will you buy me some bread , please ?
I know you hate school .
Tom hasn &apos;t kissed me in three months .
Ask Tom if you don &apos;t believe me .
How long has Tom been living in Boston ?
Tom &apos;s afraid .
How is it that you are always late for school ?
I don &apos;t know how to help Tom .
What was he doing here ?
Tom wasn &apos;t here .
Tom has something in his suitcase for Mary .
Tom and Mary were my best friends in college .
Tom says that he &apos;s lonely .
Tom , are you and John brothers ?
Tom talks too much .
I understand .
We &apos;re closed today .
This one &apos;s mine .
If you don &apos;t want to give a speech , you don &apos;t have to .
There is no hope .
Are you alone now ?
They &apos;re not good .
Tom and Mary gave me that .
You &apos;ve done so much for me .
You will soon be convinced I am right .
Tom has been in Australia for three days .
Where is the money , Tom ?
I &apos;m really looking forward to it .
I should have left earlier .
She put the key in her bag .
I don &apos;t think you need to tell Tom anything .
This is news to me .
This town is quite different from what it was ten years ago .
I wish I could join you .
I wish it had been that easy .
It may rain at any moment .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
I spent all day in the library .
Tom is three years older than his wife .
The rain turned into snow .
I &apos;ll be in Australia next weekend .
Tom hurt himself .
What time do you put your son to bed ?
That &apos;s not how you do it .
That &apos;s broken .
I don &apos;t see Tom .
It could be anyone .
Would you please do that now ?
Tom wants to know where you &apos;ve been .
How many days do you think it &apos;ll take to do that ?
Mary is Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
What are you here for ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t speak to Mary .
Give me just a little .
Why are they here ?
Tom &apos;s alone .
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat .
Have you read this ?
This coffee is so hot that I can &apos;t drink it .
That makes sense .
Tom drove back to Boston .
I &apos;m still in love with you .
Tom is hiding under the bed .
I hear only you .
You don &apos;t know where he is .
I got to know Tom when I was in college .
How did you get into my room ?
I &apos;ll get that for you .
You don &apos;t know anything about me .
I knew you &apos;d be in here .
Tom has an opinion on everything .
I want to win .
It &apos;s OK with me .
Are you in a bad mood or something ?
Tom is in a bad mood .
What has the world come to ?
Tom has always been shy .
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston .
I remember it all .
Tom thought Mary could get a job .
The water is warm .
Don &apos;t you know who I am ?
It &apos;s not supposed to happen .
They invited me to the party .
I don &apos;t understand a thing .
Everyone is doing it .
Maybe we should ask Tom if he wants this old piano .
That &apos;s good news , isn &apos;t it ?
This is too short .
I expect to come .
What happened in Boston wasn &apos;t your fault .
Tom will decide .
Tom and Mary are the same age .
Do you know his name ?
Are those for me ?
He &apos;s young and healthy .
You three seem to want something .
Tom said Mary would help him , but I didn &apos;t think she would .
I &apos;ve done everything I was supposed to do .
Tom told Mary what John wanted .
Does Tom have to stay home today ?
How do I get over the river ?
I can &apos;t handle them .
Are you going to stay there for long ?
I &apos;ve got no choice .
Tom wants to leave .
She speaks quickly .
Do you have a map ?
Tom asked a lot of questions , didn &apos;t he ?
I don &apos;t think I have much longer to live .
I didn &apos;t buy anything at that store .
Let him do it alone .
I can &apos;t explain it .
This is life !
I &apos;ll phone you every night .
Tom and Mary are still working .
I still need your help .
I had completely forgotten .
I &apos;m very hungry now .
Tom has a big dog .
We don &apos;t know each other .
Are those Tom &apos;s brothers ?
We &apos;ll take you home .
My family lives here .
Did you feed the dog this morning ?
If I were him , I wouldn &apos;t put up with it .
They &apos;re looking for it .
Tom ate one apple and Mary ate the other .
What does it look like to you ?
Let me leave !
Tom looks young .
The parents are playing a game with their children .
I have to give Tom this book .
Tom didn &apos;t understand any of it .
Which do you like better , ice cream or cake ?
Have you watched it ?
Have any of you seen Tom ?
Please take me to the airport .
Tom looked happy .
I &apos;m glad you like our house .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary why he did that .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here today ?
My grandmother lives by herself .
At first , it is difficult .
I will stop you .
Tom got home a couple of hours ago .
I was shy .
I think my mom knows .
I looked in Tom &apos;s eyes .
It &apos;ll never happen .
Tom wanted to be famous .
Tom was stupid .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was that old .
You &apos;re too little .
What did Tom ever do to you ?
Tom loves making things .
We have the best food in town .
Tom knew that Mary was busy .
No matter what happens , I &apos;ll stand by you .
I need a lot of books .
Tom promised he wouldn &apos;t say anything .
This box is light enough to carry .
Everybody had a good year .
Children shouldn &apos;t drink wine .
Your father is pretty tall .
She knows nothing about your family .
Has it stopped raining ?
I believe in him .
I need some sugar .
We &apos;re friends now .
I can &apos;t stay .
He &apos;s not a boy anymore .
Tom is playing over there .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary since October .
I have enough money to buy a car .
What did you wear ?
Tom was here at that time .
We &apos;re not crazy .
There is something about him I don &apos;t like .
Tom will take the bus .
It is difficult for me .
Tom realized that Mary was right .
How much is this tie ?
The train left at exactly five o &apos;clock .
Why aren &apos;t you going after Tom ?
It &apos;s time to go home .
It can &apos;t be true .
I want some of those .
Tom is the only person Mary can trust .
He needs to answer the question .
Tom got really upset .
I need many books .
Has Tom gone ?
He was to have called her up , but he forgot .
The plane will arrive at three .
Do you know where she is ?
Tom might be able to help you .
She took the book back to the library .
That is not the case in Japan .
Everybody loves it .
Do you remember all of their names ?
What is on the desk ?
She talks to him as if he were a child .
She stayed up late last night .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for years .
Tom seldom talks about himself .
Tom speaks several languages .
You &apos;re not working here anymore .
Perhaps Tom was right about that .
I may not have time .
Tom has promised to help us .
I ought to have a little talk with Tom .
My sister always keeps her room clean .
Can somebody please help me ?
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t help you .
Why does Tom want to do that ?
Tom is going to like it here .
Tom wrote that book .
Do you need me to give you some money ?
Tom says you need my help .
I &apos;m very strong .
Tom is in a bad mood now .
Tom wants to study in Boston .
I think you &apos;ll like it too .
Where have you been all day ?
Tom needs to buy a gift for Mary .
Do you like to be alone ?
Tom has been sick in bed all week .
Tom knew what Mary wanted to buy .
I didn &apos;t say anything at all about our plan .
Tom couldn &apos;t have helped Mary .
Tom was just about to kiss Mary when his mother walked into the room .
It could be important .
Tom &apos;s speech was quite interesting .
What is your new friend &apos;s name ?
All you can do is to wait .
There was nothing in the box .
I &apos;m so proud of my team .
There &apos;s something about Tom that I don &apos;t like .
Don &apos;t come out here .
Do I have to go with you ?
We &apos;ll be seeing you .
They are in class .
He , and he alone , must go .
My life would be completely empty without you .
Tom knows hardly anything about it .
It &apos;s too hot .
I just did what anybody would &apos;ve done .
I live in an old house .
Did you like Boston ?
Who &apos;s better at French , Tom or Mary ?
Tom says he can change that .
He &apos;s strong .
The box was empty when I opened it .
Tom took Mary to the train station .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come with us .
We &apos;re not allowed to do that .
I know where Tom lives .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that earlier ?
It &apos;s hard to please Tom .
I often study while listening to music .
Why is Tom in Boston ?
Mary has a beautiful voice .
I received a letter from my sister .
Will he be here soon ?
Tom is lying on the floor , dead .
You can &apos;t learn a language without making mistakes .
I don &apos;t want anything to do with that .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
You completely missed my point .
We &apos;re busy , Tom .
We &apos;re done here .
You &apos;re worried .
I am seeing Mary this afternoon .
These books are mine .
I didn &apos;t hear you .
I didn &apos;t have any problems .
Tom and Mary both study French .
Tom said he needed more money .
Maybe Tom was right .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
No one helped me when I was in trouble .
Take the money with you .
Where &apos;s Tom sleeping ?
Tom did his homework by himself .
It &apos;s really hot there .
What will you have for lunch today ?
Tom heard that Mary was sick .
Tom became very famous very quickly .
Tom will be a hundred years old next year .
Tom will have no choice .
Tom knows what we &apos;re doing .
Do that for me .
I would like to visit New York .
We &apos;ll stop you .
The world is small .
She will get well in a week .
I am always proud of my family .
Tom and Mary bought John a bicycle for Christmas .
I don &apos;t think I understand .
Go on , Tom , we &apos;re listening .
Where does this book go ?
I have a question for Tom .
Are you awake ?
Not everyone could hear what Tom said .
Have you seen me dance ?
Tom is one of my best students .
I &apos;d like to help you , but I &apos;m a bit busy right now .
Tom has been looking for his dog all morning .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was already married .
I &apos;ve found the answer .
Tom should thank me .
You haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
Tom began working .
Have you ever kissed another guy ?
Come home with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive .
You look satisfied .
Stop what you &apos;re doing .
That &apos;ll be good .
I &apos;ll have something for you soon .
I came with my friends .
I &apos;ll be alone .
I had my car washed this morning .
You can smoke in this room .
The water was warm .
Why are we going to Australia ?
I wanted to read a book .
He comes here almost every day .
What is his name ?
If it means what I think it means , we &apos;re in trouble .
Tom can &apos;t wait any longer .
My father has many books .
Tell Tom that I &apos;d like to help .
We all enjoyed the movie .
Tom slept in class again today .
Could you please say that once again in French ?
Don &apos;t say that .
Tom and I talked about this three weeks ago .
I met Tom yesterday .
Don &apos;t tell me Tom is dead .
You look very happy this morning .
Tom asked me if I knew his father .
I don &apos;t understand much about it .
I am able to drive a car .
She is loved by him .
That should be enough .
I know things you don &apos;t know .
Aren &apos;t you hot ?
There &apos;s nobody on this ship except us .
Tom nearly got killed .
Tom saw Mary coming .
I am no longer a child .
Can we talk ?
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his mind off of Mary .
Why aren &apos;t you using it ?
You aren &apos;t Tom .
All Tom wants to do is swim .
What did you do this week ?
I want a family .
The truth is I told a lie .
Tom thinks he knows where to find Mary .
If that guitar were not so expensive , I could buy it .
Tom is going to drive you to the airport .
I &apos;d never say that .
Do you know who he was ?
It &apos;s winter in Australia .
Tom wouldn &apos;t lend me any money .
I thought he was my brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s doing now .
Tom was invited .
I &apos;ve been thinking of you all day .
Your name came up at the meeting today .
Why do you think Tom would do that ?
Tom read a book while he was waiting for the bus .
Can you speak more than three languages ?
Are you going to buy the car ?
Tom and Mary were looking at each other .
I think that Tom is dangerous .
Why didn &apos;t you get married ?
I remember a time when we could tell each other anything .
What would life be without hope ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live here anymore .
What do you men want ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d understand .
She really looks pretty .
Who &apos;s the girl in this picture ?
I think I can .
I know the man you came with .
You were never in any real danger .
Tom is very hungry .
When did you and Tom do that ?
I never said that it wasn &apos;t a good idea .
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee .
Have you eaten lunch yet ?
I just can &apos;t make up my mind .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t there .
You need to stop saying that .
Tom is safe .
What type of music do you like ?
My family isn &apos;t rich .
Did you see his face ?
I &apos;ve forgotten his name .
Tom probably won &apos;t be here today , either .
There &apos;s no salt .
I ate too much food yesterday .
Why aren &apos;t they coming ?
Are you still friends with them ?
They &apos;re running without shoes .
I &apos;m also a teacher .
He promised not to be late again .
We weren &apos;t lucky .
I didn &apos;t read any books yesterday .
His death surprised us all .
Tom has already finished his lunch .
I don &apos;t feel like eating now .
Is this your dog ?
This song is easy to learn .
Do you like this book ?
You have to leave Boston .
Tom has left town .
They &apos;re right behind you .
We are just friends .
How are we going to help Tom ?
Tom is going to be with Mary .
I couldn &apos;t move .
Tom shut the window .
Did you buy what I asked you to buy ?
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
Tom was angry with his son .
You &apos;re both crazy .
Tom can come .
Just look at Tom .
I &apos;m talking about my friend .
We &apos;re not watching .
Tom was upset .
That almost sounds too good to be true .
He has a daughter who is very pretty .
Let &apos;s go back to Australia .
What don &apos;t you like about your family ?
He was kept waiting for a long time .
Tom and Mary are waiting .
How did you know all that ?
Please don &apos;t get up .
Tom felt sad .
Can you read this ?
She asked him some questions .
Tom is not welcome in our home .
Don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did today .
We need to fix this problem right away .
I have a feeling today is going to be interesting .
Is that your mother ?
They live there .
We &apos;ll be busy .
I &apos;m not saying his music is bad .
I &apos;d like to say something .
Tom said he &apos;d be leaving soon .
It &apos;s difficult to find work .
They left before the end of the movie .
I &apos;m able to speak French .
Tom is older than me .
I was tired , but I couldn &apos;t sleep .
I have to learn French .
It &apos;s not stupid .
I &apos;m just about done .
I &apos;m in Boston for a whole week .
I loved school .
Do you think I don &apos;t know ?
No one knew that but Tom .
Tom and I both want you to be happy .
I &apos;d like to see her .
I slept like a baby .
Tom isn &apos;t that strong .
I will say something about it .
Did you find a doctor ?
Don &apos;t ever do it again .
I believe this is the only thing I can do for you .
Are you Canadian ?
Tom will never change .
How many children do you have ?
Wait five minutes , please .
Is that Tom &apos;s umbrella ?
She is a good English speaker .
I think Tom is asleep .
We are late .
Tom knows a lot about music .
It is dangerous to drink too much .
Look at that .
It &apos;s eight o &apos;clock in the morning .
Tom didn &apos;t give it to me .
I &apos;ll thank Tom .
He didn &apos;t get in until 2 o &apos;clock in the morning .
How long has Tom been working here ?
I will give you whatever you want .
We were worried something had happened .
We found something .
It &apos;ll be good .
I don &apos;t feel like dancing .
Tom didn &apos;t return till 2 : 30 .
I &apos;m taking my daughter to Boston with me .
You can &apos;t just go .
I &apos;m not satisfied with your explanation .
What do you do when you don &apos;t have time to eat lunch ?
I don &apos;t know them at all .
His house is not far from here .
I was not a good mother .
Mary is kind of cute .
Tom lost his hat .
That &apos;s how we do things .
Tom won &apos;t be away for long .
Tom seemed sick .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d actually read the book .
Tom made tea for me .
Where did you and Tom first meet ?
Have you finished what you were doing ?
I don &apos;t have much time .
It was already dark when Tom returned home .
You have to take this .
She has a good heart .
Nobody is scared of Tom .
You don &apos;t miss a thing , do you ?
Don &apos;t you like Boston ?
Why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
When was the last time you saw Tom wear a tie ?
I think Tom is tall .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working here .
She wanted to become a teacher .
They married when they were young .
Give them money .
Tom and Mary are probably scared .
He tried again and again , but didn &apos;t succeed .
It doesn &apos;t matter what she said .
We &apos;ll all go together .
What &apos;s that building behind the hospital ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have long to live .
I like that tie .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so happy .
I hope to hear from you soon .
We saw it .
I think Tom should be home with his children .
I &apos;m going to work by bicycle .
That apple is big .
Do you want some more milk ?
I felt like I would die .
How about this one ?
Everybody &apos;s different .
He is not down yet .
I &apos;ll get home on Monday .
I managed to get to the station on time .
Who &apos;s working tonight ?
How many friends do you have ?
Tom knows how much Mary loves him .
There &apos;s not enough coffee .
I spent my vacation at the beach .
Tom wasn &apos;t scared .
Tom stayed in Boston for three days .
You &apos;re not alone .
Tom plans to go visit Mary in Boston one of these days .
Tom is in a meeting , but Mary &apos;s in her office .
I love my mother very much .
Tom didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
Are you drunk ?
Tom has a very nice voice .
I &apos;m not tired yet .
She lives alone .
I could show you around the city .
I &apos;m sorry for that .
Everything &apos;s OK .
Tom said Mary is fine .
Tom should &apos;ve asked Mary for help .
Don &apos;t put it that way .
Tom is likely to still be outside .
I &apos;m dying to see my mother .
Tom and Mary live in a house by the river .
I still don &apos;t see it .
Is that your new boyfriend ?
I have to take a break .
Will you help them ?
What languages do you know ?
Tom gave an apple to the teacher .
I would rather stay at home than go to the movies tonight .
He couldn &apos;t help laughing at it .
&quot; Where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; How would I know ? &quot;
You &apos;ll find nothing here .
I &apos;m trying not to cry .
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
Some people read the newspaper while watching television .
This is the house where I used to live when I was young .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for anything .
Tom can &apos;t say for sure how many times Mary has been to Boston .
Tom and Mary will keep their promise .
It looks good on you .
That old bridge is anything but safe .
I &apos;m trying to sleep .
What &apos;s the good of having a car if you don &apos;t drive ?
Tom , Mary and John all live in Boston .
Tom and Mary knew this .
Tom has been here for about three years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you where Tom is .
I don &apos;t work in Boston .
The plan did not succeed .
Why did Tom spend time in prison ?
There must be another way .
Everything &apos;s changed .
How do you know when to stop ?
Do you know why Tom doesn &apos;t drink ?
Tom and I are students .
Tom kissed Mary .
I &apos;ve never seen anybody die .
This is a small book .
Tom has too many books .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want me to drive you home ?
I expect I &apos;ll have to do that for Tom .
We &apos;re not leaving you here .
She plays the piano every day .
This coat is too small .
I don &apos;t have money .
I &apos;ll study French , too .
I must have made a mistake .
Tom looks more like a teacher than a student .
You drive too fast .
I &apos;m too busy to talk to you now .
I &apos;ll be there .
Tom has it wrong .
I now know why Tom did what he did .
There &apos;s a pencil on my desk that you can use .
Tom and I were married to each other for three years .
I don &apos;t want to drive .
Call the police and tell them what you told me .
I saw Tom do that .
I like their pictures .
What school do you go to ?
Tom isn &apos;t here .
You haven &apos;t seen Tom , have you ?
I don &apos;t know how to do anything else .
I must be out of my mind .
I just want to be loved .
It &apos;s better you don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m going to do it for you .
You &apos;re always so worried about what other people think .
You have no idea what this means to me .
You &apos;re from Boston , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom showed up just in time .
Today was better than I thought it would be .
That &apos;s the way .
He is wearing glasses .
You &apos;ve already forgotten .
Tom was willing to try anything .
Her dream has come true at last .
I read your letter yesterday .
I can hear you , but I can &apos;t see you .
Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning .
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom helping Mary ?
Tom and Mary fight all the time .
I wonder if she is married .
Today , we &apos;re going dancing .
Tell me where the wine is .
This isn &apos;t love .
These cars are big .
What &apos;s the secret ?
I wasn &apos;t at Tom &apos;s party last weekend .
I &apos;ll get this .
The dog looks sick .
Maybe Tom should stay here with Mary .
Where did you learn to speak French ?
The problem is difficult to solve .
I saw the whole thing .
She walked arm in arm with her father .
Tom can &apos;t picture himself as a teacher .
It is a small dog .
I &apos;m not worried about losing my job .
We need to get this done by 2 : 30 .
I have class tomorrow .
Has Tom actually ever done that ?
Tom met Mary on his way to school .
How long will it take ?
I &apos;m looking for my key .
I love you and I want to marry you .
Tom is very popular .
I didn &apos;t have breakfast this morning .
Tom found a nice apartment for me .
I think Tom hates me .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
He showed an interest in the book .
Tom had all day to get that done .
I &apos;m usually on time .
We all love Tom .
I &apos;m injured .
You can &apos;t be too careful .
Were you out last night ?
I would like to visit you .
Tom certainly should have kept his promise .
Tom can &apos;t stand Mary and she knows it .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
The box is almost empty .
I keep asking myself that .
What do they want with us ?
I wish things were the way they used to be .
She loves Tom .
He stood in front of me .
How long were you and Tom married ?
Tom has been out of work for over a month .
Tom turned serious .
He is much taller than I am .
I was hurt by many people .
It was you that made the mistake !
What are you up to today ?
Tom believes it .
I do not care for him .
Could you do me a small favor ?
Tom will be working at home tomorrow .
This is going to take a while .
You should give up smoking .
Tom got here an hour before Mary .
Tom and Mary got married last month .
Her father is a policeman .
Why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
This is the first time that I have been here .
Tom stood still for a moment .
He is hard to deal with .
Where did you see that woman ?
Would you like anything to eat ?
Go to work .
Our teacher is not always kind to us .
We &apos;ll look at that .
I got married yesterday .
Tom is making his bed .
I &apos;ve already started doing that .
I &apos;m very happy that Tom is here .
I hope Tom is safe .
You can sit next to me .
She speaks as if she were a teacher .
He &apos;s good at what he does .
Since it &apos;s important , I &apos;ll do it .
Tom just wants to be left alone .
Tom isn &apos;t leaving .
I don &apos;t want you to be here .
This soup is really good .
What do you know about Boston ?
I need to get to this meeting now .
Tom spent three days in jail .
I really like that girl .
I didn &apos;t have a chance .
Tom left my bag at the hotel .
You should listen to him .
Which side won ?
My brother plays guitar .
I don &apos;t feel like telling her the truth .
He works very hard .
Tom says he can &apos;t stay long .
I almost wish I could be in your shoes .
There are only three girls in the class .
I &apos;ll get it for you , Tom .
Tom and Mary are young and healthy .
Here is my phone number .
It makes no difference to her whether she lives in a city or in the country .
I still think Tom is innocent .
Tom is working on it right now .
Perhaps you &apos;d better drive .
Aren &apos;t you a student ?
Tom can explain .
Tell Tom to be careful .
Where &apos;s my bag ?
I should be happy for Tom .
I think it &apos;s going to rain today .
Are you tired now ?
I had no idea what to say .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m on the list .
She hit him .
He sat looking out of the window .
We ate eggs .
He loves you very much .
My watch was stolen .
I don &apos;t think you know what you want .
I don &apos;t want that anymore .
Can I come ?
Tom thought he was going to die .
That &apos;s how you do it .
Maybe Tom is just lucky .
You don &apos;t need to answer that letter .
I like the dog .
Tom thought it was a good idea .
We &apos;re out of money .
When exactly did you get here ?
Most people here don &apos;t know how to drive .
The trouble is that my son does not want to go to school .
Tom said no one else was there .
The time will come when you will know the truth .
I &apos;m tired , but I &apos;ll study hard .
I &apos;m not afraid at all .
That &apos;d be fine .
We &apos;ll speak to Tom later .
I would like to go , too .
Mary is the only woman I &apos;ve ever been in love with .
Tom &apos;s asleep .
I do not agree with you at all .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
Tom must be rich .
I &apos;m going to hurt you .
I need some good advice .
It looks like snow .
Tom has no idea who Mary &apos;s grandfather is .
I have no hair on my head .
I won &apos;t wash your car .
I didn &apos;t see what happened .
I need a lawyer .
Tom goes to school , doesn &apos;t he ?
I have lived here for years .
We &apos;ll all miss you .
The house is pretty .
I think this is important .
Tom has a friend in Boston .
You should try a little harder .
You &apos;re not as good as you think you are .
He may be sick in bed .
I like Tom very much .
Tom is not going to do it .
This is the first time I &apos;ve heard that word .
You aren &apos;t going to walk , are you ?
The price of this car is very high .
Tom never expected to walk again .
I am able to swim across the river .
Are you still up ?
Do you happen to know where Tom lives ?
Tom must love you .
Tom was in bed all morning .
Tom is having lunch .
How long is this bridge ?
Tom doesn &apos;t mind doing that for you .
Tom and I &apos;ll be here for three weeks .
They &apos;ll remember .
Tom told everybody that he was able to speak three languages .
He helped me fix my watch .
You &apos;re going to want to see this .
It &apos;s yours for the asking , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I hate this music .
I just can &apos;t get along with him .
Tom sat reading .
I &apos;ll wait till four o &apos;clock .
Tom is a college student .
This dictionary is my sister &apos;s .
I love going to the beach .
I just didn &apos;t know what to say .
Would you help me for a minute ?
How did you meet Tom ?
Tom suddenly felt tired .
He wants to go .
I &apos;ll be back at 6 : 30 .
I &apos;m not a student .
Do you think Tom wants to go to Boston with us ?
I &apos;ll go tell Tom we &apos;re ready .
It was impossible to understand his questions .
Tom is a lawyer .
I have a big house .
I want you to go to the doctor .
She was waiting in front of the building .
They have what they want .
I can &apos;t sell you that .
I need to know how this happened .
It was in the news .
When is school over ?
I think Tom liked it .
That does it .
Please don &apos;t go away .
I knew that I shouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom likes it there .
Is there anyone else ?
What &apos;re you thinking about ?
Tom looks like a girl .
We &apos;re not going .
I don &apos;t want to cause any problems .
May I go out to play when I have read this book ?
I hate dogs .
There aren &apos;t any fish living in this river anymore .
You have to help me .
It &apos;s only just the beginning .
I &apos;m with Tom .
How many cars do you have ?
I want to tell you about Tom .
We lost a lot of time .
It looks like Tom likes his new job .
I asked Tom .
Tom just arrived .
I don &apos;t love her , not even if she loves me .
The bus leaves every ten minutes .
I was disappointed with your paper .
The boy stayed quiet .
How did you get into our room ?
Tom had a job to do .
Tom says he won &apos;t come .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t eat meat .
He loves music .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s dad .
Tom can &apos;t work tomorrow .
Tom will find out sooner or later .
You &apos;re my brother and I love you .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s married to .
I &apos;ll be at home tonight .
These aren &apos;t fish .
I &apos;m at the hospital now .
Tom , this is my brother , John .
Mary is Tom &apos;s first and only love .
Let Tom go .
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that has happened .
He took off his hat .
I can &apos;t run very fast .
He may have been right .
I could never live in Boston .
I &apos;m surprised Tom isn &apos;t with Mary now .
Do you have one of these ?
I want your love .
We didn &apos;t actually see the accident .
She came .
The sun is in the sky .
I sat down again .
Where am I going ?
She was kind enough to give me good advice .
Be careful what you say .
Tom looks up to you .
Was I seen leaving ?
He had a lot of things to do .
Tom and I have been friends a long time .
It &apos;s one o &apos;clock .
I was surprised when I saw that .
I &apos;m glad to be here .
We &apos;re all going .
I don &apos;t even know who has stolen what .
It &apos;s likely Tom will know what to do .
I think Tom is from Australia .
There is much more to be done .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;m not sure what else I can do for you .
Tom didn &apos;t say a thing .
Don &apos;t worry about such a thing .
She is getting better day by day .
I &apos;m just glad Tom is OK .
She refused to speak English .
He likes to watch TV .
You played tennis yesterday .
Do you want to see ?
When was the last time that you used this ?
Put the book back in the same place where you found it .
Give them to him .
We &apos;re like brothers .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that .
Tom said you were angry .
I know how old Tom is .
I really miss Tom .
You &apos;re right .
It was a nice party .
He &apos;ll be safe with me .
I &apos;ll show you around the city .
You should probably tell Tom you don &apos;t want to do that .
He lost everything .
Is this good English ?
I hope we don &apos;t have to wait for too long .
I &apos;m terrible at speaking French .
I have no friend to talk with .
You don &apos;t have to work today .
I don &apos;t have a boyfriend .
Tom said he never wanted to get married .
You don &apos;t look that good .
Why are they doing this to me ?
Who did you talk to ?
Did Tom say that ?
He asked me whether anybody was there .
What are Tom and I supposed to do with that ?
Tom is taking this very seriously .
Are you sure you want to do this right now ?
That &apos;s not a solution .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do it without you .
I &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t do that .
Can his story be true ?
It won &apos;t stop raining .
I want this .
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English .
I &apos;m doing the best I can .
She has a picture .
I haven &apos;t spoken to Tom yet .
What is it now , Tom ?
I know where Tom works .
Why don &apos;t you go home now ?
Tom is quite drunk .
Here &apos;s how we do it .
They did not know what to do first .
He told me that he was busy .
I think we have enough .
I didn &apos;t know the truth until yesterday .
I don &apos;t know if I can do this without you .
The girl who &apos;s playing the piano is my sister .
Tom and Mary are safe .
If you see or hear anything , let me know .
You &apos;ve never had a girlfriend , have you ?
This is always the way it has been .
I &apos;ll be right there .
What really happened ?
Mary is my wife .
There isn &apos;t anything down there .
I &apos;m in here , Tom .
Can I go home now ?
I found your keys .
I want to know who started it .
Call up Tom right away .
What did the doctor tell you ?
I was impressed by his music .
I think you worry too much .
I think that it was his mistake .
A boy is walking across the street .
Tom comes to school by bus and train .
He could not answer that question .
To hear him speak English , you would take him for an American .
I wish I could tell you the reason , but I can &apos;t .
You must study more .
All of us will die sooner or later .
Do you go to school on foot ?
My grandmother has become old .
What &apos;s the best way to get there ?
Please give me something to drink .
He seems happy .
Tom didn &apos;t actually ever go on a date with Mary .
Tom has been in prison for three years .
I &apos;ve been alone for a long time .
Tom didn &apos;t have any children .
Does what you do make you happy ?
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner .
I don &apos;t have a choice . I have to do it .
I hate this town .
This has nothing to do with what happened here last week .
Tom isn &apos;t really my type .
I prefer to do it on my own .
Why can &apos;t he play tennis today ?
Are you still in love with Tom ?
Have you decided to go to Australia ?
We don &apos;t have to do this .
We remember .
Do it right now .
I love going to school here .
We aren &apos;t in danger , are we ?
Don &apos;t be so angry .
The box is too heavy to carry .
I like English better .
The way I see it , he is right .
Tom didn &apos;t kiss me .
I only wish to help .
Is there any room for me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like you .
Did you play tennis yesterday ?
They say they know you .
Tom entered the building .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough time to get everything done .
Are you out of work ?
I called him up .
He likes watching TV .
I &apos;d forgotten how much I liked Tom .
I &apos;m not proud of this .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for you .
I have a small car .
We will do anything for you .
Tom may be doing that .
Tom is a good French speaker .
I wonder how long Tom has been here .
The police are there .
I can &apos;t decide where to eat lunch .
I promised Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me her name .
He failed the exam .
This is an apple .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
The hospital is near here .
I don &apos;t think children should drink beer .
Thanks to your help , I could succeed .
I thought the only thing you really enjoyed was golf .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be so stupid .
Tom is always honest .
Tom is healthy .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a dog .
This is what you have to do .
That &apos;s what I want to do .
I thought I had enough money .
She is always trying new things .
They saw you .
I only hope that is enough .
There &apos;s very little we can do now .
What are we looking for ?
We are going to meet him tonight .
I wish you &apos;d trust me .
She gave money .
Is this baby a boy or a girl ?
Do you really want to know what happened ?
I don &apos;t even have time to read .
Tom sat down .
There is a lake in front of my house .
There &apos;s nobody at the door .
It really happened .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you all day .
I know what this is .
This was Tom &apos;s idea .
We came to Boston yesterday .
Everything is now ready for you .
Why don &apos;t you leave them alone ?
Tom wants to go , too .
My brother is now in Australia .
I am feeling much better now .
Tom knows that Mary didn &apos;t win .
I thought you &apos;d been killed . I &apos;m glad I was wrong .
Nobody liked Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do it here .
He left immediately .
I thought that he was a doctor .
How am I supposed to sleep with all this noise ?
He told me to meet him at his apartment .
I guess I should thank you .
We tried really hard .
I guess they really weren &apos;t busy .
She is now well enough to work .
Do you like it ?
Would you care for more coffee ?
It &apos;s your fault that I just lost my job .
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me .
Tom has to be home by 2 : 30 .
What time will you leave ?
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t very happy here .
She can sing better than anybody else in her class .
I &apos;m not supposed to talk to you .
Tom heard nothing .
He will be back soon .
You &apos;re a good father .
There is a glass on the table .
I have something to ask Tom .
I can &apos;t go home .
I &apos;m going to do it again .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
They are willing to talk about the problem .
Tom and Mary are getting married soon .
I like what I see .
How long ago did you start studying French ?
I don &apos;t know why we let you do that .
I know what I did .
Mary was Tom &apos;s first girlfriend .
It &apos;s possible , isn &apos;t it ?
She &apos;s five years younger than he is .
Don &apos;t call her now .
I should never have started smoking .
Have you seen my watch ?
I have one in the car .
He does not know what it is to be poor .
&quot; Tom got a new job . &quot; &quot; What kind of job ? &quot;
Tom thinks Mary is at home .
Some of the students were late for school .
I &apos;ve got to talk to Tom .
He &apos;s fast .
Tom is studying in the library now .
Is there a bank near here ?
It was nice of you to ask .
Did I hurt your feelings ?
I am not older than he is .
Tom has a girlfriend .
Tom is not happy , either .
I see Tom .
I like her younger sister very much .
This isn &apos;t the first time this has happened to me .
I can &apos;t bear the thought of her with another man .
The bus was two minutes early .
Tom wanted that .
What does Tom want me to do ?
I know how that goes .
I don &apos;t have time to sleep .
Her sister looks young .
I &apos;m not even sure if that would help or not .
Are those Tom &apos;s shoes ?
Let &apos;s go !
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn &apos;t afraid .
Tom wouldn &apos;t discuss money .
We &apos;ve done what we could .
Tom is doing that the right way , isn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t make the rules .
Tom has already killed three people .
No one saw that .
Tom found a job .
I don &apos;t like living in Boston .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
They &apos;ll never make it .
Tom broke his arm three weeks ago .
It &apos;s not safe here .
Is Tom from Boston ?
You &apos;re strong .
What did this Tom say ?
You have to start doing that .
I wonder if Tom will be in Australia next year .
Tom left the book on the table .
Why were you in Boston ?
In Australia , they speak English .
Tom was the one .
I &apos;ll never be young again .
I feel worse today .
You seem very busy .
You can &apos;t see me , can you ?
What &apos;s your feeling about the idea ?
My father is out in the garden now .
That &apos;s my plan .
Tom didn &apos;t do that on purpose .
Tom would &apos;ve been able to do it .
This is a good thing .
At the moment , there isn &apos;t anyone in the office .
You don &apos;t understand anything .
Tom didn &apos;t answer our calls .
Tom &apos;s listening .
I think they &apos;ll understand .
There was a cat on the table .
He is afraid of the dog .
Tom said he only needed a few more minutes .
I &apos;m listening to you .
He doesn &apos;t get jokes .
Tom did it for money .
Do we have one like it ?
&quot; Where are the books ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re on the desk . &quot;
Look here .
There &apos;s no need to wait .
Tom does all his homework at school .
Tom has been very kind to us .
Tom doesn &apos;t care whether Mary does her homework or not .
That &apos;s what Tom keeps telling me .
Do you know the reason ?
It &apos;s too difficult for me .
He doesn &apos;t care much for baseball .
Tom goes to work by car .
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell Mary how old he was .
You don &apos;t have to come .
They had several children .
It was exactly what I needed .
The big question is why .
I &apos;ll have no choice .
Did you read it at all ?
He sat down and read the paper .
Please listen carefully to what I have to say .
What are you doing after work ?
I &apos;ve lived in Boston for a little over three years .
What do you want to ask me ?
Call the doctor right away .
I don &apos;t even know where she is right now .
That was bad .
I don &apos;t feel good about it .
He was standing behind the door .
A person is worth more than money .
I wish I &apos;d thought of that .
I wouldn &apos;t mind helping Tom .
Do you know who wrote this novel ?
Did you phone him ?
I want to go to school and study hard .
You can &apos;t sell our piano !
How do you know I don &apos;t know ?
I learned it from him .
I come to Boston quite a lot .
I only want Tom .
Why would I do that ?
I would &apos;ve let Tom do it .
It &apos;s the first time that anybody said something like that to me .
I hear someone coming .
This is his answer to my letter .
This noise is driving me crazy .
Aren &apos;t you glad that Tom did that ?
Why is everybody afraid of Tom ?
Tom is going to like doing that .
It isn &apos;t likely that Tom did that on purpose .
It &apos;s a secret .
You should quit smoking .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t know .
Tom and Mary both said they saw John hit Alice .
Tom said Mary is very drunk .
I &apos;m still alive .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary in years .
I have to know .
Tom must be lonely .
I &apos;m Canadian , too .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom has a bicycle or not .
You look happy .
I hope you had a good night &apos;s sleep .
I can &apos;t wait to tell Tom the good news .
Tom is three years older than Mary is .
What are you doing out so late ?
Tom opened the book and started reading .
I &apos;m in a bad mood .
I began the book .
He &apos;s wearing a new coat .
You &apos;ll do no such thing .
Turn it on .
Tom is one of Mary &apos;s best friends .
Tom is the kind of man you can trust .
Tom is really smart and also kind of cute .
Is she all right ?
We &apos;ve lived in this town for three years .
I heard that Tom wasn &apos;t a good teacher .
Have you gone mad ?
I didn &apos;t want to lose Tom .
Why does Tom want us to do this ?
Why should I care what you think ?
It happened again , didn &apos;t it ?
My wife used to stay home , but she works now .
They didn &apos;t even know we were there .
I thought Tom knew Mary .
Tom had nothing to do with what happened here .
Tom watched the news every day last week .
You might change your mind in a couple of weeks .
Tom was a good friend of yours , wasn &apos;t he ?
It isn &apos;t a fish .
If I have time , I &apos;ll do it .
I believed in Tom .
I took a break .
I believe that he is innocent .
I &apos;m on my way to visit a friend in the hospital .
It &apos;s not difficult to speak French .
Tom decided not to go to the meeting .
Why didn &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
They were afraid of the big dog .
Don &apos;t go .
There were three men in the room .
Tom promised Mary he &apos;d help John .
Does Tom have more than one girlfriend ?
Are you going to go there ?
I guess you don &apos;t remember me .
What should I do next ?
Tom couldn &apos;t afford to buy the bicycle he wanted .
The weather today is worse than yesterday .
You &apos;ve got a problem .
How deep is it ?
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend .
I prefer being poor to being rich .
Nobody had any idea what I wanted .
Tom still has to pay the bill .
A good idea came into my mind .
It &apos;s very interesting .
I don &apos;t have any friends to help me .
Let &apos;s go get something to eat .
He looked much better this morning than yesterday .
I blame Tom .
Isn &apos;t that Tom &apos;s hat ?
I think I know what this is .
I want to meet people and have fun .
I couldn &apos;t wait to talk to Tom .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t have enough money .
I don &apos;t really like you .
She has a bag under her arm .
They &apos;re expecting you .
I worked at it .
I never thought anything of it .
I don &apos;t want you to do this .
Tom wasn &apos;t tired .
Tell Tom I want to see him .
The world has changed .
We have to tell Tom what has happened .
Tom sat down next to someone he didn &apos;t know .
Tom knows nothing about Mary .
Tom was very busy today .
I &apos;ll tell you why I don &apos;t like Tom .
It was very cold this morning .
She has already left the office .
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s no longer possible .
We &apos;ll discuss this problem later .
Where are your children ?
This hat is a little too small for me .
Everybody needs food , don &apos;t they ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a telephone .
I think you should tell your parents that we &apos;re married .
You may as well wait here .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t exactly see eye to eye .
Nothing can save them now .
Why don &apos;t you want to go ?
I love books .
I &apos;d rather do this without your help .
It doesn &apos;t look good .
Tom lost his life trying to save Mary .
You can &apos;t stay here .
I &apos;ve only been to Boston once .
Let &apos;s get the party started .
Why do we have to do that ?
They say that he will never return .
Tom didn &apos;t have a chance to do anything .
When will you finish your homework ?
I don &apos;t believe Tom will cry .
We &apos;ve been so worried .
I want to know what &apos;s so funny .
I &apos;m nervous .
We can &apos;t help Tom now .
Where did you learn all this ?
How often does it rain here ?
What is Tom doing here ?
Where are Tom &apos;s keys ?
What can &apos;t you do ?
I &apos;m able to swim .
Since it was Sunday , the store was closed .
I saw her a week ago today .
I can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re being honest or not .
I &apos;ll write to Tom .
Tom asked me for money .
Tom is home alone with his dog .
How else can we do this ?
Tom was working .
Tom and I are fine .
I didn &apos;t speak with Tom .
This dictionary is expensive .
He opened the door .
Tom got hit by a girl .
He asked my mother .
Tom came to visit us .
That &apos;s more than enough .
Take a look at this .
He left his glasses at our place .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know .
I &apos;d love to talk to you .
How about tonight ?
What &apos;s so funny ?
I walked out of the movie .
They &apos;ve never met .
You don &apos;t have to go , do you ?
It &apos;s too late now .
They say that he is very rich .
I want to hear what Tom has to say .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it .
He may have told a lie .
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital ?
Do they have a computer ?
He got up early so he &apos;d be in time for the train .
I didn &apos;t give Tom any choice .
Tom is going to be back from Australia tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is going .
I have no one to help me .
I wrote down his address on a piece of paper .
You didn &apos;t have to do it straight away .
Who helped Tom ?
I didn &apos;t write anything .
Tom failed because he didn &apos;t study .
I thought it was very good .
Tom said that he loved me , too .
Have you made your decision yet ?
I wanted to say thank you for all your help .
I &apos;ll do this .
I hear Tom &apos;s voice .
All you do is work .
We &apos;re not listening .
I &apos;m going to run .
I did it for him .
Tom called me and asked me to come to Boston .
I love my family .
That &apos;s quite a problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much .
She decided to marry him .
I only just met Tom .
What were you doing at the hospital ?
I am happy to hear your voice .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid to speak French .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve met Tom .
I &apos;m going to try .
You &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
You can &apos;t live like that anymore .
Tom has a lot of work to do .
Can Tom walk ?
I &apos;m not good with names .
Tom told you something , didn &apos;t he ?
The doctor may have said so .
This is really important .
Tom tried to open the window .
He was brought to tears .
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary .
I already saw this .
I &apos;ll take your word for it .
It &apos;s fun to visit old friends .
Tom stood in line .
There &apos;s something down there .
You &apos;re on your own .
He played with his cat .
Tom used to bring me here to swim when I was younger .
Tom hasn &apos;t been sick in a long time .
If you wish , you can go .
Tom is not fast enough .
Tom said he had a cold .
It wouldn &apos;t take long for us to do that .
The old man is taking a walk in the park .
Tom should &apos;ve listened to you .
I made rice .
Tom needs to go shopping for his mother .
He &apos;s old and crazy .
I don &apos;t think Tom is home .
Let &apos;s go by taxi , OK ?
What else do you want me to do ?
I saw Tom .
I haven &apos;t been in Australia very long .
I was about your age when I came to Boston .
Tom slept outside .
Tom says you &apos;re cute .
I didn &apos;t know the answer .
Tom has brought you flowers .
I think Tom expected this all along .
Did Tom study French yesterday ?
He &apos;s been staying at that hotel for the past five days .
Tom put his hand on Mary &apos;s .
I have lost my camera .
Tom is taking a day off today .
Maybe Tom can tell you what needs to be done .
Look , I know you &apos;re busy .
I was at school .
I don &apos;t know how to say what I want to say in French .
Why does Tom not like you ?
You want to stay alive , don &apos;t you ?
What else could it be ?
He &apos;s always been kind to me .
I received your letter .
Can you see without your glasses ?
Tom isn &apos;t a very good man .
Tom had to sell his car .
I know you have to go back to Boston .
I like that one .
Don &apos;t do that anymore .
Can I wait for Tom here ?
Did you find someone to help you ?
Tom needs us .
I have a lot of friends living in Boston .
Tom is proud of his daughter .
I like my soup to be warm , not hot .
How do you know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary ?
We want to help .
We live near the large library .
This time is no different .
You should eat something .
I think I &apos;m right .
Tom sat down on the bench next to me .
She is quiet .
My bike was stolen last week .
I enjoyed talking with you .
When did you visit New York ?
Tom doesn &apos;t tell me anything .
We &apos;re like family .
Nobody &apos;s going to die .
What you say is right .
Tom may have said that .
Tom has worked in Australia .
She &apos;s not my girlfriend . She &apos;s my sister .
Everybody is different .
French isn &apos;t easy for us .
People ask me that all the time .
I don &apos;t love you anymore .
Tom talks about you all the time .
I &apos;m a little hurt .
We need each other .
No , I didn &apos;t help .
I forgot what I was going to say .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know how to write his own name .
I really liked the movie .
Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t know how you do it .
Is this Tom ?
He gets up early .
We have had more rain this year than last year .
What choice did I have ?
I can hardly hear you .
I want to answer the last question first .
You may still do it if you want to .
If only he would marry me !
I know everything now .
I wasn &apos;t on time for school this morning .
Are you good at French ?
You have everything you need , right ?
Tom told me what he thinks about my plan .
Tom would do anything to win .
Tom hit me on the head .
Are you in favor of the proposal ?
Tom immediately began playing again .
You give up too easily .
Tom lost his wife seven years ago .
Let &apos;s study .
Who lives here ?
Do you want to go home now ?
I &apos;m not saying that what she did was right .
Tom might think that we want him to do that .
Do you like apples ?
Tom is a very close friend .
Tom noticed that Mary was asleep .
We have a lot of work to do today .
Why can Tom speak French so well ?
I &apos;ve said what I had to say .
I have a little money now .
That &apos;s a good thing to have .
Tom hates it when people keep him waiting .
Tom works at a bank .
How did Tom find us ?
I &apos;m drinking water .
Tom knows what he wants .
Tom said that he did nothing wrong and that it wasn &apos;t his fault .
The dog is as good as dead .
I &apos;ve been waiting for her for an hour .
We don &apos;t miss anything .
Tom will be here soon .
He knew the story already .
Is he taller than his brother is ?
I think I &apos;ll be fine .
I am sorry that my friend is not here .
Tom is as tall as you .
Mary is a mother .
Tom likes taking care of the garden .
I &apos;m feeling tired .
I &apos;m beautiful .
I was in great pain .
We went to school by bus .
I thought that I told you I didn &apos;t want you to do that anymore .
Are you going to tell Tom what I did ?
You look like your dad .
I &apos;ll see Tom .
I don &apos;t want that .
She lives in this house by herself .
Put it on my bill .
He doesn &apos;t speak my language .
I know nothing about him .
Tom looked tired .
Tom wants to see Mary again .
I wish I had been a bird .
It &apos;s not broken .
I &apos;m going to play tennis tomorrow .
It &apos;s not going to be long .
Will you go to Boston next week ?
That &apos;s a nice picture .
Tom left the room suddenly .
I still haven &apos;t told Tom .
Tom ate all the bread that I bought yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to be here .
Tom said that you and he had lunch .
We are here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
I was the one who taught Tom to read .
I heard that he bought a new computer .
Tom doesn &apos;t have one .
Don &apos;t forget your umbrella .
Why do you not like Tom ?
I had my camera stolen .
Try harder next time .
Here you are .
Do you want me to drive you home ?
I &apos;m looking for a gift for my father .
Who else is on that list ?
He asked for the money .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us that he didn &apos;t know how to swim ?
I can &apos;t explain any of it .
Tom is afraid of Mary .
I don &apos;t plan to do that by myself .
Tom has a few friends in Boston .
Do it at once .
We don &apos;t have much time .
They aren &apos;t happy to see Tom .
She was so tired that she couldn &apos;t walk .
I know how hard Tom studied .
I &apos;ve told you everything .
I don &apos;t know if I still have it .
I think it &apos;s time for me to say what I really think .
I don &apos;t have time to explain it now .
I went to see a movie with Tom after work .
This is easy .
Isn &apos;t life just great ?
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
He is still too young for the job .
Most Japanese eat rice at least once a day .
I &apos;ll be there for you .
He has not seen much of the world .
Nobody is so busy that they cannot find time to read .
No one likes it .
&quot; What time is it now ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ten o &apos;clock . &quot;
I have to go to the bank .
Tom sure is full of himself .
Tom said he had eaten nothing , but that wasn &apos;t true .
Tom said that he had been busy .
He doesn &apos;t love his girlfriend .
I want to know who sent you .
It could take hours .
Tom doesn &apos;t like women .
I don &apos;t have anyone who &apos;d travel with me .
Tom wants to keep things the way they are .
I must buy a pair of shoes .
I &apos;ve got that .
My sister has a nice piano .
That &apos;s something I try not to think about .
Tom looks older than he really is .
Let &apos;s meet in front of the library .
They have no idea what our problems are .
You &apos;re not dead .
Can anything else be done ?
I know you have a girlfriend .
I &apos;ll see how Tom is .
Did he tell you what to do ?
Be quiet , all of you .
Is your school far from your home ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like girls like Mary .
I &apos;d rather not go .
This is the village where I was born .
I &apos;ll come with you .
Don &apos;t be shy .
She died yesterday .
I thought you said Tom was in Boston .
Are you in a good mood ?
I would often play tennis with him .
We have to stop Tom .
What do you want me to say ?
Tom , it &apos;s not your fault .
Tom looked tired , but happy .
He should thank me .
Tom was here less than an hour ago .
We &apos;re very sorry .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
Tom doesn &apos;t usually go to work by car .
He &apos;s going to make it .
Tom is almost as tall as I am .
Do you still have feelings for her ?
It &apos;s not worth much .
Tom worked all day long .
I know myself very well .
Where would Tom go ?
You don &apos;t have to go to school tomorrow .
I &apos;m not your daughter .
We must move quickly .
It &apos;s very dangerous .
She asked me who had arrived first .
Are you OK with this ?
Tom slept on the bus .
We were expecting a lot of snow .
We only do what we &apos;ve been told .
You should tell your mother as soon as possible .
He isn &apos;t able to do that .
I didn &apos;t see a doctor last year .
Did Tom tell you ?
I &apos;ll leave Tokyo tonight .
Where is your sister ?
You should get out once in a while .
That &apos;s what brought us together .
I &apos;ll need your help .
I &apos;m doing it for you .
Here &apos;s your lunch .
I &apos;m fed up with homework .
Tom says he &apos;s not going to do that .
I just wanted to see what it was like .
Tom wasn &apos;t honest .
I &apos;ve got no plans tonight .
That doesn &apos;t mean anything .
The girl smiled at me .
The door won &apos;t close .
Tom realized that he had no money on him .
I wonder what all of them have in common .
My name &apos;s not Tom . It &apos;s John .
I bought this shirt yesterday .
Tom gave me a ride to the airport .
I am a bit crazy .
I might as well give up .
I don &apos;t hear that often enough .
You have a message .
It &apos;s quite warm today .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
Tom left five minutes early .
Tom can &apos;t leave now .
I still haven &apos;t found Tom .
I think I understand it now .
Would you please stop talking ?
I don &apos;t like being alone on the beach .
We should &apos;ve listened to you , Tom .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s Christmas already .
I hope you &apos;re not planning on wearing that dress to the party .
Tom wasn &apos;t wearing shoes .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you for over an hour .
What happened to the money I gave you ?
Tom thought Mary had made a mistake .
I will study English at home .
Tom loved us both .
I think I might be in Boston next Monday .
You can &apos;t tell me who I can or can &apos;t talk to .
Do you think I look happy ?
Aren &apos;t you going to drink that ?
Tom and I were alone .
Get off me .
It took him two hours to finish his homework .
Why is this computer here ?
Why did you invite Tom to the party ?
I &apos;ll do what you say .
You &apos;re the only person who ever comes to visit me .
I wasn &apos;t disappointed .
The dinner is almost ready .
We &apos;re going to have a baby .
Is everybody happy ?
I didn &apos;t recognize anyone in the room .
Please write down your name .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll pass this exam .
That isn &apos;t French .
Tom is no longer in prison .
Tom became angry .
I don &apos;t have much money .
That &apos;s about it .
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t help ?
I don &apos;t know who the man is .
This has to be the truth .
Tom is about the same age as Mary .
Something &apos;s strange .
You must study hard .
Give me my money back .
I am a bit drunk .
Tom wondered why Mary was so mad .
Tom thinks he knows what Mary is doing .
Let &apos;s start at the beginning .
That &apos;s a secret I can &apos;t tell you .
Why would I want to help Tom ?
I went to school here .
Tom asked Mary for her phone number .
I thought you &apos;d be home studying .
No one lives here anymore .
He will travel abroad next year .
They will be safe with me .
Many people like to travel .
Let &apos;s go out for a walk .
Come on , let &apos;s go .
I almost feel sorry for you .
I wonder where she lives .
I can &apos;t believe Tom told you .
Tom needs a driver &apos;s license .
We want to talk to Tom .
This is going too far .
Tom &apos;s not home .
She drank the beer down .
Tom let us go .
Don &apos;t give me anything .
He &apos;s my first love .
I &apos;ve always wanted to learn to cook like you .
I have no idea where the others are .
Nobody had an answer .
Who is she ?
I &apos;ve asked Tom not to do that .
Do whatever you want to do .
I didn &apos;t see what was in the box .
How do you plan to help ?
Is it true that you were absent yesterday ?
Tom has no money .
Tom got in the car .
It would take a long time to explain it to you .
Tom fell into bad company .
Tom had no idea Mary was sick .
I want to know .
Do you think Tom is in love with you ?
If Tom said it , it &apos;s probably true .
The people are angry .
Tom quickly realized that he was different from the other children .
Look at what you &apos;ve done .
Tom only has one small suitcase .
Tom was a bit nervous .
I spoke to Tom just a few minutes ago .
I was born in the winter .
I had to study English .
That is all that he said .
Tom is wrong as usual .
We &apos;ve got a lot to do .
I was in Boston almost all summer .
Look ! There &apos;s a cat in the kitchen .
Perhaps Tom and Mary should travel together .
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow ?
It &apos;s a beautiful night , isn &apos;t it ?
He &apos;s three years older than her .
My sister often looks after the baby .
Don &apos;t you know what it is ?
I drink milk .
Tom often goes there .
I came looking for you .
You can &apos;t sit with me .
Tom will be ready for us in about ten minutes .
They love me .
You should come .
Tom told me that he was disappointed .
Tom isn &apos;t guilty .
He knows how to speak to children .
I need your answer by the end of the day .
We may be late for school .
Tom loves Mary . I know he does .
I can &apos;t marry Tom .
Please don &apos;t let go of my hand .
Is he going to help us ?
He could die .
I met your father yesterday .
Isn &apos;t the answer easy ?
I wonder why Tom didn &apos;t go to the concert .
Tom knew that I was sad .
I tried to keep from laughing .
He isn &apos;t able to do it .
Is he kind to you ?
Are these all Tom &apos;s books ?
We have to trust them .
What else did you expect ?
How long will that last ?
Who &apos;ll drive ?
Is your child a boy or a girl ?
I believe we &apos;ve seen enough .
They want something from us , but I don &apos;t know what .
Have you seen my sister ?
The man that I see is very tall .
I &apos;m good at what I do .
Did Tom fall ?
She isn &apos;t good enough for him .
You have to make Tom believe you .
I &apos;ll give you one more chance .
Tom is quite often late for school .
I might go swimming today .
I don &apos;t care for flowers very much .
He was injured in the accident .
I want to know what &apos;s going on here .
I agree with you .
I went to the park this morning .
I thought I was dead .
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as I love you .
How many times do I have to tell you this ?
Do you know who Tom is hiding from ?
He still wants to come .
Do you think Tom saw us ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom .
Tom asked us to be quiet .
Will the police come ?
She &apos;s too young to get married .
I think he likes you .
I didn &apos;t say anything .
Tom went to the park to meet Mary .
Tom pretended not to know the answer .
They did what had to be done .
What are you reading right now ?
Where on earth were you ?
How &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
I could do nothing .
Do you see anything you like ?
I &apos;d like to visit Boston .
I don &apos;t want to see it .
Tom is a good friend .
She pretended to know nothing about it .
Would you like to come ?
The child fell out of bed .
Can I work here ?
Let me do that for you .
Tom taught me many things .
Tom asked us not to come .
Mary was my first girlfriend .
I &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
What we should do next is the question .
I got a lot out of that book I read .
I just want to get it over with .
I hope that Tom can wait for us .
You have to do as I say .
I don &apos;t want kids .
Tom and Mary have three children .
This dog is Tom &apos;s .
Tom wears a suit to work every day .
I can &apos;t tell yet .
No one noticed Tom .
I don &apos;t have any children .
This is still not good enough .
He asked me for my phone number .
They &apos;re coming to the park by bus .
Tom is as busy as ever .
Tom and Mary got married three months ago .
I don &apos;t know where she lives .
He is still standing .
He turned down my offer .
I wonder whether Tom is as old as Mary .
I &apos;ve got money .
There &apos;s something here that Tom should see .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
Don &apos;t you think you can do better ?
I thought I told you I didn &apos;t want you to do that anymore .
When &apos;s Tom getting here ?
I haven &apos;t read all of these books .
You could &apos;ve said something .
You can &apos;t give up hope .
I thought you &apos;d like Tom .
She &apos;s been working all day long .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to meet you .
Tom is a good friend of yours , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom is going to make mistakes .
I hope to marry that woman one day .
I don &apos;t have a horse .
I spent last year in Boston .
You &apos;re always welcome here .
He stopped reading a book .
I would like to ask two questions .
No one speaks this language anymore .
You two seem to get along well .
It will be over in a moment .
I learned nothing from the teacher .
Tom likes you a lot .
You have no right to do this .
Could you please hurry ?
This is not quite enough .
I can lend you some money if you like .
What do I owe Tom ?
She gave me a nice pair of shoes .
There is one thing I want to ask .
The lake is big .
I feel sorry for her .
Tom lives with his father .
How do I look ?
I am not too tired .
You know what I want , don &apos;t you ?
Why can &apos;t you just leave me alone ?
What did you drink ?
Where is the ship now ?
There were a number of students in the room .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind walking in the rain .
You aren &apos;t wrong .
I like being in Boston .
&quot; What did she say ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t remember . &quot;
Tom couldn &apos;t hear what was being said .
Do you know that girl ?
I &apos;ll carry you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
I want to hear all about your trip to Boston .
I &apos;m very glad that I did it .
Can I get you a beer or something ?
Take a look , Tom .
Tom lives with his parents .
I thought you loved that .
He speaks English and French .
Tom can &apos;t understand why Mary is angry .
Many university students don &apos;t have a lot of money .
When do you have to do that ?
My car is right there .
Your secret &apos;s safe .
Tom almost never goes to Boston .
I &apos;m going to Paris next month .
We just weren &apos;t good enough .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been sick .
Why don &apos;t we ask Tom &apos;s advice ?
I put on my shoes .
Tom looks guilty .
It &apos;s good that you &apos;re here .
Tom doesn &apos;t fit in here at all .
No one asked you .
I can &apos;t do any more .
I can &apos;t die here .
No one is coming with me .
I always take a bus .
I take the bus to work every day .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to pay anything ?
Put it where you like .
You may do whatever you want to .
You can &apos;t smoke in school .
No one really knows .
I can &apos;t work with Tom .
This isn &apos;t a bad thing .
I see the book .
Tom likes pizza .
How would we get it done ?
The test was easy .
We have to find Tom .
I just asked because I thought you would know .
Don &apos;t hurt her .
Why would Tom leave ?
Tom is not happy .
Why did you even bother to come ?
I &apos;ve got to get dressed for school .
What are they looking for ?
I am proud of my father .
Does Tom still owe you money ?
I didn &apos;t mean anything by that .
What books did you buy ?
Tom has a thing for you .
Can you give me the keys ?
I can &apos;t quit now .
In the summer , people go to the beach .
Can I tell you a secret ?
Why didn &apos;t I see that ?
I went shopping last Monday .
We must stop them .
That &apos;s not why .
I think this book is worth reading .
Can I take a picture of you ?
Tom had some questions he wanted to ask .
Would you like to hear my opinion ?
Tom wasn &apos;t hurt .
You &apos;ve got to see this .
He is good at cooking .
He is here !
I &apos;d like to dance .
I &apos;ve received another message from Tom .
There are some eggs in the box .
I don &apos;t know Tom well , but I know his wife .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can live without him .
Do you know what I mean ?
I like your idea .
I &apos;m doing a lot more now than I used to .
Why are Tom and Mary here ?
I don &apos;t have to go to the doctor any more . I &apos;m feeling much better .
Tom told everybody that he was afraid to do that .
The food was very good .
I &apos;m sure it would be a mistake to tell Tom .
I just meant it as a joke .
Tom didn &apos;t know that the bridge was closed .
Tom never asked questions .
Tom is married and has three children .
That sounds really interesting .
I was disappointed that she was not at home .
Please tell Tom it &apos;s important .
You can stay here as long as you want .
I was in Boston last week .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along very well .
Not everyone in town likes you .
You can &apos;t leave until we say you can leave .
I can &apos;t take it any longer .
Tom is my dad .
I don &apos;t know any of her students .
Can we sing ?
I wish I were taller .
Can I stay with you for a few days ?
I like this song better than the last one you wrote .
Tom comes to see me once in a while .
Tom saw somebody .
She looked at him and knew that he was angry .
Tom says he &apos;s not done yet .
I live in Boston , too .
Tom should be in bed .
I &apos;ll wait right outside .
Tom rarely spoke .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only one at the meeting that I knew .
Tom drives me crazy .
I stopped smoking .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the truth .
I think they were all fired .
She will have her own way .
This one is on me .
I didn &apos;t get much .
We &apos;ve got to start doing that .
You really need a woman .
She has three children .
Everyone smiled .
Let &apos;s go talk to Tom .
Tom made a good choice .
There is a small garden in front of my house .
Is it going to snow tonight ?
Is the coffee strong enough ?
He pretended to be my friend .
I can run faster than Tom .
The cup is full .
I didn &apos;t say it was going to be easy .
She gave them some apples .
What language do you speak ?
We have a long way to go .
It &apos;s not a good time .
What they did made Tom happy .
It was a really beautiful day .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s brother .
I have a few friends .
I have a radio .
Tom can &apos;t have gone far .
Can you swim ?
Who was right ?
What should I say to Tom ?
What Tom did was very wrong .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have enough money .
It &apos;s been tried .
Just let me go .
Don &apos;t tell Tom .
My friend has arrived .
Do you think Tom is guilty ?
What else do they need ?
When are you going ?
The kids are sleeping .
Tom has to be home .
I bought a dictionary .
Tom ran into the shop .
English is a language spoken all over the world .
That &apos;s what Tom said , too .
I just want to sleep .
The baby &apos;s awake .
I suddenly feel very much alone .
What kind of bird is this ?
We &apos;ll leave at 2 : 30 .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gone swimming together in a long time .
I just don &apos;t understand you anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like dogs .
Tom and Mary are listening .
I thought it wasn &apos;t supposed to rain today .
I read Tom &apos;s letter to Mary .
Where are my glasses ?
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it better .
Tom is rarely late .
She &apos;s very interested in music .
It makes me sick .
Tom asked Mary to buy him something to eat .
I like where I live .
I cannot understand it .
You did a really good job .
It was a new experience for Tom .
I have no one to go to for advice .
I don &apos;t like to go outside when it &apos;s raining .
It turned out that I was right .
What kind of person are you ?
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
Tom won again .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t remember seeing Mary at the party .
Don &apos;t spend so much time watching TV .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink much beer , but he sure drinks a lot of wine .
Tom finished the bottle of wine by himself .
Tom knows just how you feel .
Give me another cup of tea .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary .
You could help me .
I can &apos;t give it to Tom .
We learn a good deal at school .
Tom has a daughter about your age .
I tried to convince Tom to help us .
I was just looking out the window .
I am still alone .
My son is small for his age .
I &apos;ll give Tom whatever he wants .
Do you think we &apos;ll have good weather tomorrow ?
He was able to solve the problem .
I &apos;ll take this coat .
Did you forget ?
You haven &apos;t tried hard enough .
We haven &apos;t been able to find out much yet .
I &apos;m going to be late for the meeting .
It &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
She works at a bank .
You guys love each other , right ?
There is an apple on the table .
Tom speaks only French to his parents .
Tom saw Mary do that .
You must go .
Tom loves the new house .
That &apos;s what we do here .
The apple fell from the tree .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how long the party is going to last .
She smiled at him .
Tom is sleeping now .
How do I get one ?
You &apos;ve never been to Europe , have you ?
I &apos;m looking for my hat .
He makes fun of everybody .
The girl has no mother .
I could actually see myself living here .
Tom was very happy .
I really wish I could help .
He talks a lot .
We &apos;ve got to tell Tom .
Where did you have your suit made ?
I have some work to do this evening .
Tom probably won &apos;t win anymore .
At that time , Tom was sitting between Mary and John .
You did all you could .
I should go now .
Tom went missing .
I &apos;m very happy .
When she was young , she was very beautiful .
Is this your first trip abroad ?
Tom asked Mary why she was so late .
He made up his mind to marry her .
No one knew what to do .
I &apos;m going out with Tom .
Do you want to play ?
It just has to be done .
Tom can &apos;t handle this anymore .
I ate with my baby brother .
She shouldn &apos;t go by herself .
Tom went to Boston by himself .
My father has been dead for three years .
She called him .
I &apos;d like a glass of water .
I like coming to Boston .
Tom gets home almost every day at 2 : 30 .
Tom has asked Mary three times to marry him .
What did you bring me ?
What is it like in Boston ?
Mary thinks I &apos;m in love with her .
Are they dead ?
Tom likes you very much .
Are you planning on buying a house ?
I &apos;m going to miss being here .
Tom hardly said a word all day .
I &apos;m busy all the time .
Tom and Mary are like family .
I wonder why Tom needs that .
I think I &apos;m beginning to understand .
I gave Tom a chance .
Tom wouldn &apos;t listen to my advice .
Tom looks tired . Please take him home .
Tom said it was out of the question .
Tom speaks French better than Mary .
He &apos;s found a new love .
Tom will be free tomorrow .
Please go on with your story .
That &apos;s my cat .
I know Tom isn &apos;t guilty .
I don &apos;t want to get sick .
Does this have anything to do with Tom ?
I want to help as many people as I can .
They &apos;re all scared of Tom .
Is Tom alive ?
I don &apos;t want you to do that , Tom .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better myself .
Do they live with you ?
I thought you said Tom was dead .
Everyone knew what to do .
Can you remember how to play that song ?
Tom and Mary got married young .
Go to the hospital .
Tom can &apos;t find Mary .
There &apos;s more wind today than yesterday .
What &apos;s up , Tom ?
I don &apos;t want a horse .
I don &apos;t want sugar .
It &apos;s going to be dark by the time we get to Boston .
If you have something to say , please say it .
I &apos;m not giving up .
Tom made up his mind to be a teacher .
Stop thinking about it .
I don &apos;t have time for a vacation this year .
He was not at all satisfied .
What do you do here , Tom ?
They love Tom .
It seems rather expensive to me .
Tom and Mary have a daughter named Alice .
Tom is sleeping on the couch .
My brother is a teacher .
Your name wouldn &apos;t be Tom , would it ?
Why did Tom do that ?
You &apos;re not safe here .
Why do you speak French so well ?
I like being alone .
Tom can &apos;t sing very well .
Today is not so cold .
I was very careful .
Why don &apos;t you leave Tom alone ?
I &apos;m going to sit here until Tom comes .
I think they saw me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have tea .
Tom didn &apos;t like Mary &apos;s parents .
What are you after ?
He gave the boy what little money he had .
I think Tom might like that .
I &apos;m sure Tom will be here soon .
I think Tom is thirty years old .
It seemed that she had already received the money .
I know what both of you are thinking .
Where &apos;s the teacher ?
Tom and Mary are doing OK .
We see with our eyes .
I &apos;ve never had this kind of problem at work .
It &apos;s for my family .
He likes to talk of love .
I don &apos;t understand your question .
You should be proud .
It hasn &apos;t been that long .
There is one less .
I remember her .
Will you be ready by 2 : 30 ?
They understood .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s brother .
I wasn &apos;t alone then .
That question is easy to answer .
You &apos;re very beautiful .
Do you want to do that ?
He doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom is the only one here who doesn &apos;t know Mary .
I can &apos;t do it right away .
Tom almost killed himself trying to do that .
I wonder why I &apos;m so tired .
Tom believes Mary made the right decision .
We must do it now .
I don &apos;t see any reason why I have to apologize .
He died one year ago .
It &apos;s what I like .
We have a test tomorrow .
I hurt my foot .
It was kind of you to help me .
His house is by a river .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand .
I haven &apos;t done any of the things you &apos;ve asked me to do .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
I think Tom might finally have a good idea .
We didn &apos;t know what train they &apos;d be on .
I &apos;m so confused .
Tom didn &apos;t work last Monday .
That makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
Your hair is too long .
Tom might &apos;ve already won .
I can &apos;t believe that actually happened .
Do you want me to put this on the table ?
That was two years ago .
I saw you there .
Tom needs to see me right away .
Tom &apos;s passport has been stolen .
I don &apos;t know why .
It is not easy to solve the problem .
This rarely happens .
Do your best , and you will succeed .
Tom appears confused .
How serious are you ?
I really want to know .
There &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
They believe it .
I think it &apos;s fine .
Mary &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s name is Tom .
I like it when you do that .
Tom can run much faster than I can .
She should not have done such a thing .
It would be fun .
Someone needs to take care of Tom .
I don &apos;t drink wine .
The children are safe .
I &apos;m in the car .
That was serious .
It is a good idea to read this book .
Put it there .
I need to go back to Australia .
The baby will be able to walk soon .
Can you tell if this is Tom &apos;s ?
Tom wants money .
It &apos;s my job to help people like you .
I still have some homework to do .
Tom called Mary and asked her if she wanted to go to a movie with him .
Tom is family .
You should have asked her for help .
She loves children .
We want to talk to you about a problem .
We have to go .
I don &apos;t think I want to talk about it .
My door was closed .
I have very little money .
Tom took off running .
Tom will soon become a father .
We just have to do our best .
Have the children eaten yet ?
The answer is completely wrong .
What &apos;re you doing for Christmas ?
Please tell me your name .
Do you want to go shopping with me ?
It &apos;s very easy to learn how to swim .
His house is by the river .
We pay Tom well .
How often do you eat food you don &apos;t like ?
I &apos;d appreciate that .
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not the case .
I wasn &apos;t hungry .
My house is small .
He shut the door behind him .
Tom and Mary are very happy .
It &apos;s not always like this .
It was kind of funny .
Why are you so interested in him ?
I asked him if he knew her address .
Tom spent three years in jail .
Will it rain today ?
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house almost every day after school .
A few days later , Tom found a new job .
He asked me to do it .
This will help keep you warm .
I know a lot about you .
I bought it with my own money .
I don &apos;t want to be in your way .
I think Tom is up to something .
What do you want to study at college ?
We go out together every weekend .
I &apos;ve paid you already .
Let &apos;s see what happens .
Tom comes to see me almost every day .
Tom could be dead .
If anything happens , let me know .
How do you think they &apos;d do it ?
You &apos;ve always been very good to me .
Tom put our names on the list .
Tom is eating lunch now .
How &apos;s it going with your family ?
It can happen to anybody .
I &apos;m working on something .
Who wants it ?
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me .
What makes you think Tom wants to do that ?
Make sure that you do it yourself .
It was dark under the bridge .
He often comes late to school .
We don &apos;t have to read that .
You look good without your glasses .
I &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
She turned down our offer of help .
This is the reason why he did it .
It &apos;s you who doesn &apos;t understand .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go to a movie .
I don &apos;t remember what happened .
This is exactly what I wanted to see .
We &apos;re not going to wait for Tom .
I know what you &apos;re doing .
No one will stop me .
You &apos;ve made too many mistakes .
Have I told you this joke before ?
I &apos;m very hungry .
Tom would like to know what he did wrong .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be very happy together .
I &apos;ll have someone show you to your room .
Don &apos;t blame me .
Tom stuck to his promise .
That has always been so .
I was taught something different .
Tom told me he would go to Boston .
You are children .
Who else could &apos;ve done it ?
Are you speaking to me ?
What is popular now ?
Is Tom going , too ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary .
I think Tom likes his job .
They &apos;re both fine .
I saw my mother hiding the cake .
I &apos;d like to hear what your opinion is .
We can do without a television , can &apos;t we ?
Tom ran back into his apartment .
I have a lot of questions .
Don &apos;t say anything .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a new bicycle .
Don &apos;t let Tom help Mary .
When are you going to get here ?
He &apos;s giving it a go .
Tom will be at home tomorrow .
I tried to be like you .
Can Tom pay for all this ?
Where did you buy these shoes ?
Where do you use French ?
Tom doesn &apos;t let his children drink wine .
Whose phone number is this ?
I was impressed .
That &apos;s not interesting .
Perhaps Tom wanted to buy that .
Tom never liked Mary .
You &apos;ve told me that before .
I &apos;m not as rich as I &apos;d like to be .
I seldom eat meat anymore .
These shoes are way too small for me .
Tom has big problems .
Who did you come with ?
I didn &apos;t want to die .
How long did you stay at the party ?
Is that a new tie ?
How do you kids do it ?
I saw Tom swimming across the river .
I just want to help .
You don &apos;t look very good .
We &apos;re busy .
This is not going to end well .
Tom knows Mary kissed John .
Tom &apos;s gone .
That &apos;s another story .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell you anything .
I &apos;d like to be alone now .
It &apos;s totally wrong .
We &apos;re leaving now .
I &apos;m out here .
We must keep calm .
We saw everything .
My uncle gave him a present .
He says that he enjoyed it very much .
Tom is a good father .
We never talk .
I &apos;m not here every day .
I had to carry Tom &apos;s suitcase for him .
He showed me her picture .
Tom always takes his time in everything he does .
You know what I meant .
Tom came on Monday .
There was nothing that we could do for them .
I like to learn new things .
Tom spoke French to me .
Tom studied very hard .
Tom isn &apos;t here now .
I &apos;m shy .
I wonder if Tom is nervous .
This could be a mistake .
Tom said he didn &apos;t enjoy watching baseball .
I &apos;ll fix you some coffee .
You &apos;d better do as the doctor advised you .
I &apos;m going , too .
It &apos;s that time again already .
I got the money back from him .
He is always studying .
I think this is what you &apos;re looking for .
Tom wants a new bicycle .
Maybe it &apos;s not interesting .
I just told Tom .
He &apos;s not my boyfriend . He &apos;s my brother .
Is that Tom &apos;s ?
We went shopping with our friends .
What color is your hat ?
I asked Tom how his job was going .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m here .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my dog .
I don &apos;t work for you anymore .
I live from hand to mouth .
Why did you buy a car ?
I was invited .
I &apos;ll explain everything .
Tom sat down with Mary .
I don &apos;t understand it .
Do you want to go for a swim ?
I don &apos;t like his way of talking .
Tom makes a good living .
Some things are impossible .
Tom said that he had a cold .
I don &apos;t know that for sure .
Tom is very good at doing that .
Tom has many friends in Boston .
He &apos;s now studying .
Tom may come today .
That big one is also mine .
I have just been to the post office .
You &apos;re a good boy , Tom .
Tom may do whatever he likes .
Do you think Tom saw it ?
Did you just hit Tom ?
It &apos;s much too cold to swim .
We &apos;ll have to do it even if we don &apos;t want to .
Tom loved Mary and Mary loved him .
Why are we really here ?
I just can &apos;t stop crying .
Tom already left .
He didn &apos;t speak to me for several days .
Do you really want me to do that ?
This river is beautiful .
You &apos;re with friends .
He never takes the train .
The dog likes you .
The flowers in the garden are very beautiful .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his umbrella .
That &apos;s not what Tom said .
I &apos;m not allowed to tell you .
They &apos;ve got enough to do already .
I want to know why you don &apos;t like me .
I think you &apos;re going to like it .
I &apos;m not very good at swimming .
They &apos;re tired .
I think it &apos;s time for me to leave for school .
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle ?
Tom , I need your help .
She &apos;s stupid , but honest .
Why won &apos;t you talk to me ?
Tom is able to speak French .
I &apos;ve studied English for five years .
Let me show you the way .
Tom takes a walk every morning .
Give me a glass of water , please .
Is Tom there , too ?
I don &apos;t need a girlfriend .
I am taking tomorrow off .
Tom helped Mary yesterday afternoon .
They became nervous .
What do you mean , I &apos;m not your type ?
Are you pleased with your new job ?
My mother plays the piano well .
These aren &apos;t my keys .
There is no reason why I should help him .
He started the day with a good breakfast .
She ran outside to see what had happened .
Don &apos;t make me sorry .
I do not understand .
Why does everyone think I &apos;m stupid ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll ever meet Mary .
I would like you to meet a friend of mine .
Who will pay ?
Who &apos;s going to believe that ?
I &apos;ve decided not to go .
Aren &apos;t those your parents ?
I haven &apos;t yet done what you said you wanted me to do .
I can &apos;t do that .
Give Tom the money .
Don &apos;t let Tom near my kids .
This watch is not mine but yours .
I never thought I would get married .
Everyone seems to be nervous .
That &apos;s his business .
This is my coat , and that is my father &apos;s .
I could ask Tom to help me do my homework .
The dog went away .
We must not be late .
You should eat .
Someone must have left the water running .
I &apos;m looking for my shoes . Have you seen them ?
I &apos;ve been asked to do that again .
I was there yesterday .
The old man has enough money .
The question is how he will get the money .
Tom , Mary and John were all there .
You know why I &apos;m here .
Could you help me ?
Tom came to Boston to visit Mary .
Tom drove home .
I am sick of his long speech .
I &apos;ll never leave you alone again .
I &apos;m a bit nervous right now .
I &apos;ll never be able to play again .
Do you know it ?
You don &apos;t have to be scared .
My parents were proud of me .
She is not a good person .
We went for a walk on the beach .
Where did Tom eat ?
Do you have something to say ?
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman .
Tom likes his new job .
Can you tell me where Tom lives ?
He stopped smoking and started running .
They are older than Tom .
I could have been injured .
Her dream has come true .
Is all this money yours ?
Tom is actually eating right now .
Please don &apos;t do that again .
Can &apos;t they speak French ?
It must &apos;ve been expensive .
I know Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
You have no right to say so .
Where would you like to go next Monday ?
This is my father &apos;s .
Tom had no problem doing it .
I don &apos;t want to listen to you .
This is all on me .
We only have one more left .
I don &apos;t go shopping as often as I used to .
What time do we leave tomorrow ?
I think you worry too much , Tom .
I will be taking the exam about this time tomorrow .
I am tired of my work .
I &apos;m trying to get in touch with my sister .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who did that .
Who will do it ?
He can &apos;t take a joke .
This is a very busy station .
He talks fast .
I asked him where he was going .
Why doesn &apos;t anyone believe me ?
We &apos;re late .
All I want to do now is sleep .
You are exactly like your father .
Tom and his team are ready .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you have a car .
Tom isn &apos;t so old that he can &apos;t work .
Tom started to sing .
I only meant it as a joke .
What &apos;s that boy &apos;s name ?
Tom and Mary wanted to be left alone .
Not only his son , but his daughter is famous as well .
I know what they &apos;re like .
Tom waited in front of the house .
He was speaking .
I love doing this .
Tom didn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
No problem .
She stayed there for several days .
Tom wants to know what Mary did last weekend .
What &apos;s in it for us ?
I don &apos;t feel like it .
Do you want a cup of coffee ?
After you , Tom .
He looks old for his age .
She caught my eye .
Tom was just happy to talk to someone .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
What will you do ?
I don &apos;t think Tom would try to do that without our help .
He did it while he was drunk .
You &apos;ll feel better tomorrow , I promise .
I can &apos;t tell what it is .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to do that anymore .
I waited for Tom for three hours .
It won &apos;t take so long .
Can you take me to the airport , please ?
You &apos;ll have to work hard if you want to pass the exam .
Why was I never told about this ?
I just want to be alone right now .
I have to get that .
Do you mind much ?
How long have you been in Japan ?
I ought to have written the letter yesterday .
I was in London last month .
Tom seemed very surprised when I told him about it .
How do you know where to go ?
We &apos;ve done all that we could .
I want to go to a hotel .
Do you like your brother ?
Tom &apos;s mother &apos;s name is Mary .
Everyone wanted a piece of the cake .
When was the last time I told you I loved you ?
I don &apos;t think Tom has as much money as Mary does .
Tom drove his kids to school .
Tom gave his dog something to eat .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom will come or not .
They won &apos;t know .
Tom can &apos;t be right about everything .
The movie was really good .
I usually go to bed at nine .
I had no idea there &apos;d be this many people here .
All of us went except for him .
If Tom had asked me for some money , I &apos;d have given it to him .
Tom wants to work for Mary .
What do you want to do with that ?
The men are eating lunch .
You &apos;re not the first person to say so .
I don &apos;t have enough money .
I hear the sky is very beautiful there .
He has lost his father &apos;s watch .
I don &apos;t know what to do from now on .
Did you speak to Tom about this ?
Do you want to know what it means ?
Tom makes three times more money than I do .
We no longer need you .
I think I &apos;d want to know .
Tom left at 2 : 30 .
I saw Tom doing it .
We may never know what really happened .
She looks young , but she &apos;s actually older than you are .
I &apos;m out of money .
You can &apos;t stop Tom .
I &apos;m always surprised by him .
I need someone to help me .
I waited for ten minutes .
You don &apos;t want to go , do you ?
Don &apos;t spend too much money .
Tom worked all night .
I &apos;ll be done in five minutes .
I don &apos;t know who he is .
Tom did everything he could .
She plays the piano very well .
Do you know where Tom was hiding ?
Maybe Tom gave it to Mary .
I don &apos;t think Tom would want to go to Boston with you .
I shouldn &apos;t have told you anything .
How much can we take ?
It would be better for you to stay in bed today .
Tom bought Mary a car .
She likes him .
We &apos;re not going to leave Mary alone with Tom , are we ?
Why should Tom sing ?
Tom talked to Mary yesterday .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom about anything .
What &apos;s happening here ?
I &apos;m going to go call the police .
It &apos;s the best book that I &apos;ve ever read .
I &apos;m not going to explain it to you .
Why isn &apos;t that good ?
Tom is drinking a beer .
I only did what was necessary .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even discuss it .
We have three children .
You don &apos;t have to be crazy to work here .
I know why Tom is doing that .
&quot; Tom &apos;s death was an accident . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
I like milk .
My wife is the boss at home .
Mary is now studying in her room .
Tom will be here all evening .
We live in a house .
How about some music ?
She was so sad that she did not want to speak to anyone .
What time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
Tom is new .
I go shopping almost every day .
Tom and Mary left together .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything to me about that .
I have the same opinion .
I hear you &apos;ve got a new girlfriend .
Everyone &apos;s talking about what Tom did .
He is his friend .
I thought that you might &apos;ve left town .
Tom liked it , too .
Tom knows he can trust Mary .
All the dogs are alive .
I &apos;ve lost my glasses .
I &apos;d still like to have coffee with you .
Tom ran away as soon as he saw me .
We have to help Tom .
Why aren &apos;t you here , Tom ?
It would be better if you went by train .
The train pulled out exactly on time .
Tom was right about one thing .
You can &apos;t win all the time .
Call me again in two days .
I had nothing to say to Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet whether he &apos;ll go or not .
She &apos;s not my girlfriend .
My boyfriend thinks I &apos;m crazy .
You &apos;re here early .
I don &apos;t want to work .
Tom hadn &apos;t eaten anything the whole day and was hungry .
He is better today than yesterday .
He &apos;s eating an apple .
Our son died in the war .
Have you ever tried to swim across this river ?
When you get to be my age , you &apos;ll understand what I mean .
We &apos;re very satisfied with it .
I think you know what I mean .
Do you want more ice ?
Will we be there soon ?
He can &apos;t buy a car .
I &apos;m not satisfied yet .
There is a test tomorrow .
We &apos;re worried .
Tom didn &apos;t ask me to do anything .
I &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s really not possible .
How are things at home ?
I hope that Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s dangerous to swim in this lake .
I &apos;ll call you back .
I &apos;m happy here .
We do need your advice .
That &apos;s a bad day for me .
Tom can drive a car .
I wish you hadn &apos;t done that .
Do you want to go , too ?
I know what happened to Tom .
What did you want to show me ?
She doesn &apos;t like baseball very much .
There &apos;s nothing else to do .
Tom is still waiting for you .
What languages are spoken in America ?
You must always do what is right .
I have something good to tell you .
It should be possible .
Tom got angry with me .
He got up suddenly and walked out of the room .
They &apos;re crazy .
I just want to be happy .
Tom asked me to tell you something .
I broke his heart , but I love him .
It &apos;s not us who did it .
Tom isn &apos;t your brother .
I don &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
I &apos;m proud of my father .
Why do you think Tom likes baseball so much ?
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
I was with Tom last night .
I wrote the book .
Do you want me to tell you how to do that ?
They are just going to the store over there .
What books have you read in English ?
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to bed so late yesterday .
There &apos;s a lot to see in Paris .
All good things must come to an end .
This dog isn &apos;t mine .
You &apos;ll be asleep by the time your father gets home .
I &apos;m quite sure of it .
Why is Tom still standing outside in the rain ?
I &apos;ve had the same problem .
What I did was wrong .
Give me the key .
You can tell Tom not to worry .
Tom still doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
Tom can &apos;t move very fast .
She took a job in a store for the summer .
We &apos;ve seen her .
The whole world speaks English .
He said that he was happy .
I thought I knew everything .
Tom can &apos;t explain it .
This book was new .
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow .
I cannot trust a person like that .
Tom became nervous .
I met her last winter .
Do you not like girls ?
This is the boy who helped me .
Tom asked Mary many questions about Australia .
There &apos;s no one in the house .
They won &apos;t have a chance .
Tom told Mary how he and John met .
They all have one thing in common .
Tom wasn &apos;t so sure himself .
Tom was always different .
I would like to thank my parents , Tom and Mary .
You were totally right .
We &apos;re here to see Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t know what he was doing .
He &apos;s too old .
I &apos;m happy for both of you .
You &apos;re cute .
Have you read this yet ?
Do you speak French ?
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m not Tom .
I helped my mother even though I was busy .
We played together every day when we were kids .
I have a very good opinion of Tom .
Tom can &apos;t buy a car .
&quot; Give me another bottle , &quot; he said .
I know Tom would love to see you .
I started learning English six years ago .
What he is saying does not make sense .
This could take a long time .
We like children .
She tried hard , but she failed .
Please tell me the answer to the question .
You &apos;ve done more than enough .
We want to help Tom .
I need a map .
Tom appears convinced .
Do you want the job or not ?
I want this to be yours .
What makes people do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
I play soccer every day .
We have to tell them .
He &apos;s wanted by the police .
Are you ready to eat ?
I couldn &apos;t see Tom &apos;s face .
The answer is simple .
Tom picked up the cat .
Tom smiled again .
You should have seen it !
I want to talk to you about this list .
I study English at home .
I just want Tom to get well .
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee .
Who wrote this ?
That didn &apos;t work .
You &apos;ll learn a lot here .
I should &apos;ve said that .
We don &apos;t need to go to school tomorrow .
How far is it from here ?
Have you decided what you &apos;re going to do ?
Can you please stop that ?
I feel good this morning .
Would you like to hear me sing ?
I told her to sit down and drink a glass of water .
The lunch is on the table .
Did you tell Tom about Mary ?
I think Tom did exactly what he said he did .
I &apos;ll call you if I hear anything .
I had a good sleep .
I like to get things done on time .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that very often anymore .
Is it possible that it &apos;s already eight o &apos;clock ?
She could die .
I &apos;m going outside .
Tom didn &apos;t see you .
Who sent you ?
Have you told anyone about this problem ?
Aren &apos;t you going to go with Tom ?
He gave them food and money .
Tom is exactly like his father .
Tom doesn &apos;t always arrive on time , but Mary usually does .
When are you going out ?
Tom doesn &apos;t read .
I will give you anything you want .
We do know what to expect .
I can &apos;t remember exactly how old I was when I first met Tom .
I feel safe here .
How much does a bottle of beer cost ?
What are they up to ?
I felt the same way .
Tom left his keys in the car .
Which cup did you drink out of ?
I have few friends .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to his advice ?
I have done everything I could do .
Tom went home angry .
Take us with you , Tom .
My brother &apos;s six years younger than I am .
I won &apos;t be leaving until tomorrow .
I want to have a talk with him .
You should have learned how to swim when you were young .
Tom will be here today .
Tom will drive you home .
I have no idea who it was .
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ll have time to finish reading the rest of this book .
Why would I laugh ?
That &apos;s very simple .
I like working .
I don &apos;t really know .
Please have someone else do it .
I can open the window .
He doesn &apos;t like us .
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else does .
I &apos;m not going home .
We made many mistakes .
I did what Tom told me to do .
I read this book when I was in college .
What about this dress ?
Can Tom do that ?
You &apos;re my child .
Tom doesn &apos;t look his age .
They had fun with us .
We &apos;ll be there by 2 : 30 .
Perhaps Tom wanted to do that .
I think I &apos;ll go home .
Tom isn &apos;t supposed to smoke at work , but he does .
My brother is interested in English and music .
Tom could have come to my concert , but he didn &apos;t .
I &apos;d like to travel around the world .
I want to know what &apos;s good .
I &apos;ll call you right after the meeting .
I &apos;d like to know more about it .
I &apos;m not going to ask again .
You have no idea what this is , do you ?
That &apos;ll be nice .
This isn &apos;t for Tom .
There is your bag .
What I want is to go home .
That happens to us all the time .
This is Japan .
I wanted to help Tom understand what Mary was trying to tell him .
Did you see that ?
It &apos;s a good movie .
Tom is afraid of you .
Why do you think Tom said that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go there .
I saw her somewhere two years ago .
I don &apos;t let Tom go swimming by himself .
Tom always seems to be mad at everyone .
You can &apos;t let that come between you and Tom .
How about another cup of coffee ?
I have a lot of work to do today .
I thought I told you to get out of my way .
This is a fine ship .
Tom will go as well .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s computer ?
She doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
You must think for yourself .
There are no problems .
Tom bought me a book .
How long ago was this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this for me .
That &apos;s what I think .
You &apos;re going to love it .
Please don &apos;t be sad .
Thanks for your help .
The others are playing outside .
Nothing &apos;s been changed .
It &apos;s really very easy to do that .
You &apos;re hard to understand .
We love it .
What did you make ?
It &apos;s all mine .
Are you for or against his idea ?
Who sent this ?
We &apos;re sorry , but we can &apos;t do anything more for you .
That was the first time I was ever alone with Tom .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love it .
Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
Please don &apos;t speak French here .
Tom is the only one here that can do this .
Can you hear me , Tom ?
What was Tom up to ?
Do you believe Tom ?
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
I do hope that he will get well soon .
Where is the train ?
It may take a while .
Tom is small .
She must have been rich in those days .
I , too , didn &apos;t understand anything .
What does he expect ?
I know Tom better than he knows himself .
Tom will come with me .
I &apos;m not a child anymore .
There are many people who don &apos;t speak French .
Tom didn &apos;t want to do that .
When she entered the kitchen , no one was there .
We enjoyed watching TV .
I &apos;ll give it to you tomorrow .
Are you for or against the war ?
Why do you think Tom doesn &apos;t like it ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have let Mary drive .
He wants to talk to you .
I &apos;ll be home as soon as I can .
I often have the same dream .
I &apos;d like to know where Tom is .
I need to be on my own for a while .
I can &apos;t explain the difference between the two .
I found it funny .
The concert will take place next summer .
I &apos;ve always done that that way .
I &apos;m happy that Tom is happy .
Tom was asleep when I left .
Did you buy a new car ?
The fire started in Tom &apos;s room .
I haven &apos;t done very much this year .
I don &apos;t like that woman .
It really happened , didn &apos;t it ?
Why should we help you ?
She bought a book at the shop .
It is very hot here in the summer .
She is listening to him .
Is that man over there Tom ?
People don &apos;t do that .
Tom will be staying with us for the next three weeks .
I can &apos;t believe he did that .
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I walked to school .
Which one do you like best ?
I &apos;d really like to go swimming this afternoon .
Don &apos;t keep company with him .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll like it .
Don &apos;t let Tom leave before I get there .
Who &apos;s missing ?
Tom is helping out in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t want to talk .
Tom was there .
I &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t go on Monday .
What will become of her ?
Our summer is short , but warm .
I wonder why Tom was late .
Tom is now in prison .
I need friends .
This bike is easy to ride .
I have a big favor to ask .
You &apos;re doing really great .
Whose bicycle is this ?
Tom wasn &apos;t very hungry .
Did you know that Tom bought a new car ?
I &apos;m in Paris .
We &apos;re not doing it .
It was not easy to convince him .
Tom always speaks in French .
How often do you go abroad ?
It &apos;s almost seven . We have to go to school .
I was asked if Tom could speak French .
Why don &apos;t we try doing this again tomorrow ?
Tom had nothing to lose .
I &apos;m not shy .
As far as I know , he did nothing wrong .
The cat is on the table .
Tom sounds almost proud of that .
I think I love you .
I won &apos;t be staying with you .
She seldom eats breakfast .
Don &apos;t hurt him .
Something may have happened to him .
We decided to stay for a few more days .
Please teach me how to do that .
I thought Tom had a day off .
Tom said he thought that Mary might need to do that today .
He left the class because he was feeling sick .
I &apos;m getting tired of losing .
I can &apos;t give up smoking .
Tom can speak French and English .
I have to leave because there &apos;s someone waiting for me outside .
I won &apos;t be long .
I &apos;d like Tom to take me home .
I &apos;m sorry , but I didn &apos;t understand what you said in English .
I &apos;ll see you very soon .
I &apos;ve been here before .
I don &apos;t remember exactly what Tom said .
Excuse me , do you know what time it is ?
We know you didn &apos;t kill Tom .
Tom was sleeping when Mary got home .
Tom is three years old now .
Tell me everything you know about that .
I plan to go to France next year .
I made Tom go there .
I wonder why he is late .
I &apos;m pretty sure it was Tom that I saw .
Tom isn &apos;t in a good mood .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; house .
I will tell you about him .
I let him go .
I need to get another few hours of sleep .
That &apos;s very dangerous .
Tom did what he promised to do .
Tom goes to church every Sunday morning .
I have a question .
Tom can swim very fast .
The door is open .
Aren &apos;t you going to eat with us ?
Have you decided what to do yet ?
This bus is going to Boston .
Is Tom nervous ?
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
Tom is writing letters .
I &apos;m so tired that I can &apos;t study .
He can &apos;t sing .
We &apos;ll find Tom .
I might be able to help you .
This is no longer funny .
Tom is probably still hiding .
You may take either of the books .
I wonder why he is so angry .
I have to stop .
What &apos;re you after ?
When did you ask Tom ?
I want to go to college .
I don &apos;t know how to answer that question .
He kept talking .
It doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;ll get paid this week .
I like to walk in the country .
Tom said that he really liked me .
I think Tom is in love with me .
You aren &apos;t thinking .
How &apos;s your mother ?
Tom spent all evening on the phone .
Tom wants to go with you .
That &apos;s not my fault .
Don &apos;t ask so many questions .
I had to stay home .
Where do Tom and Mary live ?
I was very busy .
I don &apos;t have anything .
Tom is taking a break .
I can &apos;t explain anything .
Do you have a daughter ?
I love them both .
Tom gave me the key .
The food &apos;s not ready yet .
I hardly knew Tom .
I won &apos;t make that mistake again .
Tom is very happy .
Did Tom say anything to you at all ?
We never get enough to eat .
You two are brothers , right ?
Could you give me a few more minutes ?
I &apos;m the one who killed Tom .
Can I stay ?
When did you begin learning English ?
Did you see my father ?
I know everything I need to know .
That boy over there looks about the same age as you .
I expected Tom to be here .
How do you like your new house ?
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
That &apos;s exactly what he wanted .
I sometimes see him on TV .
Tom and Mary sat together on the couch .
What you said made Tom mad .
Everything went well .
They &apos;re not talking .
Tom was afraid of making a mistake .
Will you take care of the children while I &apos;m out ?
Tom made fun of the teacher .
I &apos;ve been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour .
I really like this song .
Don &apos;t you have anything to do ?
I drove to town and went shopping .
We got married a few years ago .
How much longer are you planning to be in Australia ?
Who did you go to the beach with ?
Tom won &apos;t like this .
Tom went into his office and closed the door .
I know why you &apos;re here .
Today &apos;s your birthday .
I like what you &apos;ve written .
Let &apos;s get this over with quickly .
I can &apos;t change what happened .
Tom has done that for three years .
We don &apos;t need to do everything on the list .
Come at once .
Mary is helping her mother .
Don &apos;t be upset .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to go to bed .
I don &apos;t want anything to drink .
You can stay with us .
Tom said he found his keys .
I can &apos;t even remember what his name was .
You should thank me .
She ran as fast as she was able to .
Tom was the first to arrive and the last to leave .
You surprised everybody .
Tom wants you to do that .
Have you heard from him since he left for America ?
Some friends invited me to dinner .
Just when I was about to phone her , a letter arrived from her .
Why aren &apos;t they worried ?
I had nothing to say .
There are a few apples on the tree , aren &apos;t there ?
Today , I do not have time for this .
Let &apos;s start !
I don &apos;t think anyone can help me anymore .
Your table is ready .
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours .
I &apos;ve got kids .
That &apos;s really not funny .
The village needs your help .
Tom drank a cup of tea .
One can &apos;t live without water .
I have nothing to write .
Tom took out his knife .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom talked about me like that behind my back .
I didn &apos;t realize I had to help Tom do that .
I live here .
I &apos;m like Tom .
Tom is listening to music .
This river is very dangerous to swim in .
I &apos;ll take that one .
Tom said he knows Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom said that he was afraid to do that .
I am going to play tennis tomorrow .
This is the very book that I want to read .
He had no friend to help him .
Tom says that he &apos;s tired .
What is it you need ?
We &apos;re crazy .
This is where Tom lives .
I already know that .
It became clear that she &apos;d told a lie .
Tom called me almost every day .
Tom can &apos;t remember anything .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing .
Some boys play tennis and others play soccer .
I hope it won &apos;t be long before I hear from her .
That &apos;ll be fine .
Tom will call .
Tom will be surprised .
You &apos;re going to wait , right ?
This can &apos;t be true .
Tom sat down on the floor next to Mary .
It isn &apos;t your decision .
Tom decided to wait .
What &apos;s this doing here ?
Did you go to the doctor ?
How did you spend your summer ?
Is this seat open ?
What was left ?
Tom kept me waiting for three hours .
Is that answer right ?
I didn &apos;t want you to miss your bus .
Why are you reading that ?
I &apos;m going to speak to Tom .
Tom was a good man .
Everybody looked disappointed .
You were always too busy to talk to me .
Why is fish so expensive ?
He lives across the street .
I wasn &apos;t scared at all .
You have to let me help you .
You will do exactly as I say .
I do not have any money .
They need help .
I hate to lose .
I want you to go with me .
I think you did a great job .
Just go back home .
I have to tell Tom .
Tom has big hands .
How could Tom have known about that ?
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom .
Where &apos;s Tom from ?
Tom didn &apos;t know about it .
You are free to say what you think .
What &apos;s Tom doing in there ?
Tom knows all about it already .
Didn &apos;t you use to work at a hospital ?
When will we arrive ?
I &apos;d like to talk to you .
Give me another reason .
No way !
They &apos;re coming here .
Why don &apos;t you do it ?
I hope Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
We can count on Tom .
I thought the enemy had killed Tom .
It is possible that I forgot my keys .
They are busy .
He pretended that he was a lawyer .
She asked me if I knew her address .
Tom was too fat for Mary .
Tom hasn &apos;t been very well recently .
They &apos;re different .
Do it with me .
You can &apos;t handle this alone .
Tom was definitely afraid .
Tom must have seen me .
I know them .
Tom refused to eat .
There is a knife missing .
Tom hasn &apos;t come here yet .
Tom speaks no French .
Tom rarely smiled .
You &apos;re not as important as you think you are .
You have to go whether you like it or not .
Tom wants a dog .
Don &apos;t ever come back here again .
Tom &apos;s French is quite good .
I hope you and Tom have a good time .
He had the right idea .
They don &apos;t know us .
I shouldn &apos;t have left you alone .
Tom gave us everything he had .
Let &apos;s eat out tonight .
I know you &apos;re not like that .
He dropped his books on the floor .
This is the watch I bought yesterday .
He has never played golf .
I may have to go to Boston .
I can &apos;t figure out why nobody comes here anymore .
They soon became friends .
Tom fell off his bicycle .
He has a new woman in his life .
That &apos;ll make me happy .
Tom never talks about his feelings .
How can you still be hungry ?
I speak French much better than English .
We &apos;ll miss you .
Tom asked Mary why she &apos;d done that .
Mary wouldn &apos;t let Tom kiss her .
Tom had no one to tell his story to .
The sun was hot and they were tired .
I have lost my watch .
I wonder who they are .
Tom threw Mary &apos;s letter into the fire .
What &apos;s wrong with all of you ?
The sky is clear .
Tom didn &apos;t need to tell Mary . She already knew .
Tom wants to get married again .
I took Monday off .
Tom will arrive soon .
Tom has come .
I don &apos;t think you really want to know .
Tom comes here once a month .
Tom thought we should leave early .
I am happy with my girlfriend .
That &apos;s what Tom thinks .
I don &apos;t feel hungry at all .
How do you know Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
Tom is living with his family .
I eat fish every week .
This is good news .
There also was another reason .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
I &apos;ve been trying to solve this problem for hours .
It can &apos;t be Tom .
I no longer love him .
You did it on purpose , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom is likely to be dead .
Didn &apos;t Tom smile ?
Do you really like it ?
Her house is near the park .
Tom knows about that .
If only he had known !
He wears his hair long .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re staying .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand what we meant .
I &apos;ve always played with my brother .
Tom had to explain the joke to Mary .
No one laughed .
We know Tom didn &apos;t do it .
What &apos;s Tom looking at ?
I liked your story .
What would you like me to make you for dinner ?
Here &apos;s my phone number .
Which one is mine ?
He began to feel ill .
Tom is seldom ever on time .
We work together .
I already have a plan .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom in a long time .
What do you think about Tom ?
Let go of me !
Tom will understand .
I used to eat pizza .
I just spoke to Tom .
I will show you some pictures .
I have a lot of work to clear up by the weekend .
I didn &apos;t know what Tom was reading .
I &apos;m not impressed with Tom &apos;s work .
I had some money stolen yesterday .
That &apos;s sad .
I wouldn &apos;t sell that at any price .
I &apos;ll be going to Boston next week , but I &apos;m not really looking forward to it .
Tom has a daughter .
I will give him the book tomorrow .
Tom knows better .
Tom likes French .
Tom is exactly the same age as Mary .
That happened only a few days ago .
Tom does nothing but eat and sleep .
Have you been in Boston long ?
Tom is still afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ve known Tom a lot longer than you have .
I like Australia .
Tom has a lot of books .
I &apos;m listening .
Tom looked sick .
Tom wants to be with us .
You must read this book .
That &apos;s not yours .
I didn &apos;t know anything about his plan .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to her .
I &apos;ll miss you all .
I made these .
The problem was too difficult for me to solve .
Tom doesn &apos;t always come late .
Don &apos;t open the door no matter who comes .
I went as far as the post office .
Don &apos;t you want to do this ?
Tom wants to move back to Boston .
Do you know what time that accident happened ?
I sold it for ten dollars .
Tom isn &apos;t as young as most people think he is .
Tom makes big money .
He said that he was hungry .
I still need to talk to Tom .
How &apos;s your French coming ?
I &apos;ve already been here two hours .
This is the watch that I bought yesterday .
He doesn &apos;t know how to play the guitar .
He was not sure what to do .
Tom has changed .
I don &apos;t believe that Tom would do something like that .
I met him three years ago .
It &apos;s easy to hear you .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have liked that .
I think we have enough money .
This box is light enough for him to carry .
Tom is quite funny .
Tom will see Mary today .
We know what Tom wants .
I &apos;m not asking Tom .
Tom gave Mary a key to his apartment .
No one knows the future .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom talk ?
I stayed in Boston for three years .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us .
What &apos;s the best way to lose weight ?
I think I know that girl over there .
That made me think of you .
I think we should leave Tom alone .
What is he doing ?
She married him for his money .
They don &apos;t pay Tom much to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t get the joke .
I think you should go and visit Tom .
Can we do this later ?
This is Tom &apos;s knife .
I have to cook the vegetables .
That &apos;s part of it .
I don &apos;t think of it like that .
Go away !
Tom is busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom stayed put .
That would be funny .
That &apos;s not necessary .
Tom said that he was very busy .
The room was full of people .
You could do better .
Tom asked for money .
How far is it from the airport to the hotel ?
He has two boys and a girl .
Tom was drinking .
Tom had to go there yesterday .
The moment he saw me he ran away .
Let Tom do anything he wants .
Where &apos;s my umbrella ?
What do you want me to do there ?
Tom and I sat on the bench .
Tom looks fine to me .
We must start at once .
Tom made us do the work .
You guys have to hurry .
I don &apos;t have that much time left .
I just spoke with Tom .
I have to go to the airport to meet my family .
The lake is deep here .
He waited until she came .
It is time I left here .
Take the children into the house .
She wants to play golf with him .
Tom doesn &apos;t pay attention in school .
I think you look really great .
I &apos;m not going to work with you today .
Did you find your letters ?
He is at home today .
Tom , why would anybody be looking for you ?
Tom said that he was angry .
I wish I had done more .
I didn &apos;t know he had decided to leave .
She &apos;s eight years old .
It &apos;s started already .
Now you &apos;ve hurt my feelings .
Tom was very sick .
Tom saw the news .
He has gone abroad by himself .
Tom spoke with Mary in French .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
I already told you that she isn &apos;t here .
Tom really should be in bed .
Tom ran into the house .
What gave me away ?
We &apos;re still too far away .
I know where it is .
Tom will talk .
It isn &apos;t true .
Do I have a choice ?
I &apos;m really happy for you , Tom .
She bought that camera while she was in Japan .
Tom sounds mad .
It was empty .
Tom &apos;s family loved Mary .
Give me back the book after you have read it .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here today .
Do you know what &apos;s going on there ?
Don &apos;t be stupid .
Tom hasn &apos;t changed his mind .
Tom loves you very much .
How do you like your new school ?
Tom and Mary have a very large house .
I think you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Are you talking to yourself ?
It &apos;s not a gift .
Those children are waiting for their mother .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom very much recently .
Give me a call if you need help .
He &apos;s standing on his head .
I &apos;ll show you that I am right .
I have a friend living in London .
He made her a new coat .
He hasn &apos;t changed a bit since I saw him .
Tom did it .
What do you think of war ?
This is what he said .
Tom threw the book into the fire .
Come off it !
This is very bad .
I saw it from the window .
We can &apos;t let Tom out of our sight .
Tom is wearing a hat .
We &apos;ve known each other for three years .
That &apos;s a question for others to answer .
Please , tell me .
This problem is too difficult for you to solve .
I &apos;m quite well .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any cats .
We didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
Tom shut the door behind him .
It wouldn &apos;t be too difficult .
Tom knows this isn &apos;t good .
I want you to go to Boston with Tom .
The man is eating bread .
I didn &apos;t know you couldn &apos;t sing .
I play the guitar before dinner .
It &apos;s under the table .
The situation won &apos;t change .
There he is .
Do you really want to know ?
I told Tom what you did .
Tom got that from Mary .
I can &apos;t cook at all .
You have to help us .
I love you more than you love me .
I &apos;ll return at 6 : 30 .
He wrote one letter .
He loves coffee .
There are some pretty flowers in the garden .
Tom played the guitar .
I am learning to play the guitar now .
I &apos;ll take one .
This never would &apos;ve happened if you &apos;d done it the way I told you to do it .
Tom is busy right now and he can &apos;t help you .
I think that &apos;s very sweet , Tom .
I was very impressed .
This isn &apos;t your decision .
I have no money to buy the book with .
I can swim very fast .
I do not want any money .
Tom didn &apos;t love Mary .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time .
His wife was mad .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy it .
Tom made me come here .
Tom is good at cooking .
This is our home .
I thought you &apos;d love it .
When do I get there ?
Who ate the bread ?
Maybe what you said about Tom is right .
Don &apos;t tell her about it .
You could &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I &apos;ve been waiting for over an hour .
Tom certainly knows where Mary is .
We all enjoyed it .
He stayed at the hotel .
Why is this my job ?
Tom didn &apos;t understand my French .
It is cool after the rain .
I met my friend on the street .
He seems to have left the country .
Do you want to sing ?
No one knows where Tom is .
Tom was wearing glasses .
I let Tom leave .
She talks quickly .
I don &apos;t know who that boy is .
Tom knows who killed his dog .
Mary went about her business as if nothing had happened .
That &apos;s how we first met .
I &apos;ll always take care of you .
I wish we could live here .
I want something to drink now .
She is not here yet .
We &apos;re leaving for Australia tonight .
Tom never lived in Boston .
Where did you get to know her ?
Tom may have been right .
Come back in a day .
She is very pretty .
Tom and Mary are older than John .
Tom is waiting outside .
Tom is Mary &apos;s friend .
I don &apos;t want to live here anymore .
Just please be careful .
How else can I help you ?
Why are we still sitting here ?
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming .
We have to do this .
If you don &apos;t go , you &apos;ll have to apologize .
I want to hear it from you .
Where are we ?
What are you going to do to me ?
She thinks that she &apos;s always right .
Tom can &apos;t go home until after 2 : 30 .
Tom won &apos;t come to today &apos;s meeting .
I always thought Tom could swim .
Tom is only happy when he &apos;s with Mary .
Is it true that Tom is going to Boston ?
I thought you &apos;d be alone .
He did it for the money .
Tom said he &apos;d be here .
I want to hear Tom &apos;s voice .
Nobody ever told me that before .
Why is it that you &apos;re always late for school ?
Tom didn &apos;t want me to go shopping with Mary .
I appreciate your telling me .
Everything &apos;s in order here .
He was here at that time .
Tom is already sleeping .
I &apos;m going to visit Tom in the hospital .
It might rain before evening .
I &apos;m so sorry .
Tom believes Mary .
I want you to come .
There are a great many books in this library .
Tom is still sleeping .
Here comes Tom .
I believe Tom can win .
I went for a walk with my son .
Where are the others ?
I know almost nothing about you .
He made me happy yesterday .
If you don &apos;t want to sing , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom finished last .
I might not like it .
I go home early every day .
The coffee is very hot .
Are you Tom &apos;s daughter ?
I have what I want .
Please don &apos;t ask me about Tom .
Tell Tom not to tell Mary .
You look great .
I &apos;m not your husband anymore .
Tell Tom what this means .
Who &apos;ll go ?
Nobody I know knows how to do that .
Tom has a nice car .
You don &apos;t seem to understand anything .
Don &apos;t make an enemy of him .
How can I get there ?
She hit me , not him .
Tom knows something I don &apos;t .
There it is !
I have some very good news .
Where do we go from here ?
What is the price of this watch ?
He is my uncle .
I used to live close to Tom .
He drank a little .
You have changed a lot .
I &apos;m surprised Tom didn &apos;t show .
He didn &apos;t get paid for it .
She &apos;s very beautiful .
I understand the sentence , but I &apos;m not able to translate it .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to tell you this , but he just lost his job .
What do you really think ?
I &apos;ll talk to Tom later about this .
Did you speak to Tom ?
I just want to win .
I &apos;ll do the best I can .
What is Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name ?
Tom got on the train .
Have you ever been to the United States ?
Tom is in the garden .
I want to say I &apos;m sorry .
Tom put milk in his coffee .
You might &apos;ve been able to do that if Tom had helped you .
I know you don &apos;t know Tom .
If Tom didn &apos;t kill himself , someone else did .
Don &apos;t forget the ticket .
I believe you have my umbrella .
Tom , can you come tomorrow ?
I know that this doesn &apos;t interest you .
I don &apos;t know where you work .
Please don &apos;t ask .
I have one with me .
I &apos;ve never told a joke in my life .
I &apos;m not going to answer that question .
Tom would like to stay young forever .
She must have been very beautiful .
He is the only child they have .
May I trouble you to shut the window ?
I never thought I &apos;d find Tom .
This question is not easy .
I &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
Tom knew that Mary knew John .
Tom asked Mary to answer the telephone .
I stayed in Boston last weekend .
Even though he &apos;s very old , he &apos;s healthy .
I &apos;d like you to meet my wife .
Why are you always talking about Tom ?
It might be too late .
I wish Tom was here with me today .
I heard Tom is sick .
I know it &apos;s Tom .
Tom will come back at 2 : 30 .
Tom would just like to talk .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will go .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom wear a hat .
He came into the room .
I wish I were a bird .
Tom was sitting on the bed .
I like baseball very much .
I &apos;ve changed . I &apos;m not the same man I used to be .
We &apos;ve made mistakes .
Mary is sitting at the desk .
What &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
He isn &apos;t like his brother .
Who does Tom want to sing with ?
I am your father .
Tom is our son .
Tom didn &apos;t want any breakfast .
What does it actually mean ?
Tom should be studying French now .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend .
Many people in the world are hungry .
It isn &apos;t at all clear .
That &apos;s really sad .
You are my mother .
Tom is quite popular .
What do they do ?
I really hope that doesn &apos;t happen .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
I &apos;ll be in Boston for a few days next week .
When are you going to do that ?
This is my bicycle .
It has to be there .
Go and talk to Tom .
He spoke .
If I had enough money , I could buy this book .
You are not a child anymore .
Tom and Mary are both ready .
How are they doing this ?
I said nothing about the matter .
I &apos;d like you to see this .
Tom said you &apos;re old friends .
I think Tom is awake .
Tom was eating dinner when Mary arrived .
What will become of me ?
I can &apos;t forget Tom .
I could help Tom .
I want to see your boss .
Can you hear it ?
You should have nothing to do with him .
Is that a boy or a girl ?
It looks like Tom .
Tom was absent from school yesterday .
You have until morning to decide .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know the truth .
Tom needs a taxi .
I thought I saw someone I knew .
Don &apos;t be too sure .
I &apos;ll get in touch with Tom by telephone tomorrow and ask him to give us a hand .
Please speak as slowly as possible .
I don &apos;t want to talk about my child .
I don &apos;t care .
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house .
I had fun talking to Tom .
We weren &apos;t at home yesterday .
Please take this away .
I want to see Tom .
Tom and Mary are in trouble .
It &apos;s my money .
I know she is sleeping .
I want to go there by myself .
I didn &apos;t know what was happening .
Why do you want to stop here ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here .
I want to buy a shirt for my sister .
I &apos;m waiting for my friend .
I don &apos;t know anybody here , except Tom .
Tom has gotten older and he doesn &apos;t go out as often as he used to .
Didn &apos;t you write a letter to him ?
I don &apos;t really care what you think .
Tom is already really good .
Why are you doing this here ?
I want you to see this .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to stay .
I don &apos;t need that .
She must have studied very hard .
Tom is standing right over there .
I &apos;ll miss you very much .
Tom is at home with Mary .
No one says that anymore .
Tom never said a word .
I am married .
I thought you weren &apos;t coming .
I feel something .
There is a library in our city .
I &apos;ll call her immediately .
We love this .
Tom has been here for three days .
We all know that Tom didn &apos;t do that .
What could be the reason ?
Is this your lunch ?
I &apos;d like to get some sleep .
I got here about the same time as Tom .
All the students here must study French .
I know what you &apos;re going to say .
Tom says he does that .
You &apos;re driving too fast .
Tom arrived at work at 2 : 30 .
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that .
Tom wouldn &apos;t know .
Tom expected it .
Tom said he thought that Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
Will he eat the whole cake ?
Tom pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;d do without Mary .
The hotel was once a restaurant .
I remember seeing the movie before .
I want to stay .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to study .
Did you ask your mother ?
Why should I apologize to you ?
Tom wrote to Mary this week .
They eat a lot of rice .
Why isn &apos;t it here ?
I just find it hard to believe that Tom really believes that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you want .
Tom doesn &apos;t look at all convinced .
Do you want to take that ?
I can &apos;t get that song out of my head .
The water turned to ice .
If I had had a little more money , I would have bought it .
I think Tom gets the idea .
I have a few questions for you .
Tom came to see you yesterday .
Tom believes everything that Mary says .
I &apos;m for it .
I was your mother &apos;s first boyfriend .
They plan to get married tomorrow .
What is the truth ?
They won &apos;t care .
I have to stop drinking .
I don &apos;t like your name .
It &apos;s not going to be like that .
That &apos;s not what I said at all .
Do your homework .
This train is made up of seven cars .
Tom takes the bus to the city .
He &apos;s eight years old .
Tom and I both need help .
These shoes are too big for me .
Tom knows what Mary is doing .
Tom is looking at Mary .
I didn &apos;t see that .
They aren &apos;t happy .
He is sure to win the game .
I really miss them .
Tom says he loves it in Boston .
They &apos;re going to try .
He is about thirty .
You must try harder .
I used to eat a lot of meat .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
We are just in time for the last train .
That is exactly what I wanted to buy .
Tom is just going to need some time .
Give me your watch .
Do you have any idea who would do this ?
Why did you pick Tom ?
Why did I do that ?
I want to get to know you .
I hope this isn &apos;t true .
Tom has already won .
Tom wondered if Mary was going to kiss him .
I didn &apos;t want to tell Tom about this .
He talks as if he were a teacher .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to go , does he ?
The boy is over there .
I wonder what Tom needs to do .
I want a boyfriend .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom will hurry .
How was your trip ?
Where does Tom work ?
He is short , but strong .
I wonder why Tom is absent .
Tom and I are both a little busy right now .
I really want to thank you .
Tom isn &apos;t in Boston .
I met her by accident .
He seems to be ill .
Tom says he isn &apos;t afraid .
I will see to it .
I &apos;m going to go find Tom .
&quot; Who is in the car ? &quot; &quot; Tom is . &quot;
They were both drunk .
I &apos;ll cook for you .
We had fine weather on that day .
My sister is too young to go to school .
My parents are dead .
Are you hiding ?
Everybody knows everybody .
Who do you like better , Tom or Mary ?
I &apos;m only trying to help you .
Tom couldn &apos;t take it any longer .
I &apos;d like to know more about Boston .
I had him take my suitcase to the room .
Tom is known for that .
Tom had no time to waste .
Tom , where are you ?
I was nervous the whole time .
Tom found my bicycle .
Everyone knew that Tom didn &apos;t want to visit Boston .
Give me what you have in your hand .
I guess it &apos;s only a joke .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
This makes me very happy .
Have you really already found a new job ?
Could I have some more tea ?
Tom asked me if I were hungry .
Tom is old enough to go to school .
What happened to him ?
We walked to my room .
Someone said Tom is looking for us .
Tom ran home .
I have a lot of flowers .
Could you give me that piece of paper ?
Tom can fix just about anything .
These are for Tom .
They all have come .
Tom is learning English .
I don &apos;t remember any of it .
Please lend me your book .
I had always supposed that Tom was innocent .
I &apos;m at the library .
We don &apos;t have a daughter .
We couldn &apos;t see a thing .
I have to be here .
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French ?
Tom never wrote to me .
Tom &apos;s not home yet .
Tom wanted to get back to the office .
I think Tom is still in Boston .
This joke is not funny .
I am afraid he will make a mistake .
I have no time for reading .
He wore old shoes .
This problem is difficult to solve .
I need you to come with me .
I wasn &apos;t there .
Who &apos;s talking ?
I got a new bike for my birthday .
I didn &apos;t really know what I was doing .
We can &apos;t do that .
You look terrible .
This is my home .
I hate my job .
He went to America last week .
The old man spoke to me in French .
If only it would stop raining !
I &apos;ve loved you for a long time .
I hope it was worth it .
This isn &apos;t good .
Tom asked me why I didn &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
We &apos;ll be here .
The price of the car is too high .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do anything .
Tom just called .
Why would I tell you ?
Which book would you like ?
The child will be six .
I did not read a book yesterday .
You cannot live by love alone .
Tom likes coffee better than tea .
If I don &apos;t get the job , I &apos;ll tell Tom .
We &apos;ll never forget that .
I have two brothers and a sister .
If I were rich , I &apos;d give you money .
I still have some work to do .
This work must be finished by tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money .
Today is my best friend &apos;s birthday .
What am I going to do now ?
Can I get something to eat ?
Tom took off his coat .
I should never go shopping without you .
We all make mistakes .
I was crazy to do that .
I can hardly remember Tom .
He doesn &apos;t watch television at all .
Why did he live in the United States ?
This would be a mistake .
It &apos;s your home .
Do you have two books ?
I do not want any milk at all .
He could not bring himself to believe her story .
What kind of man are you ?
I know what people want .
Did you enjoy reading that book ?
I &apos;ve got good news and bad news .
The guy playing the piano is Tom .
Why &apos;s everything so dark ?
Is it for me ?
Tom gave up .
I can &apos;t call anyone right now .
You &apos;re free to go .
You make me very nervous .
Why are people afraid of Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary .
I hope that she will get well soon .
Tom has promised he won &apos;t do that anymore .
Tom has been arrested more than three times .
Tom will go alone .
Tom is expecting me .
I arrived at school on time .
He was busy yesterday afternoon .
Who are you and why are you here ?
The light is out .
It won &apos;t last more than three minutes .
I thought you &apos;d say that .
It seems like you know me , but I don &apos;t know you .
We want to make absolutely sure that Tom wants to do that .
I don &apos;t know where he went .
Do you think this book is worth reading ?
They know who they are .
This tea is really sweet .
I think you &apos;re sitting in my seat .
Tom is off duty tonight .
I couldn &apos;t have said that better myself .
That boy looks like Tom .
What were Tom and Mary doing at the hospital ?
I will never make such a mistake again .
I have few books .
You &apos;ve already done that .
Tom smiled at Mary and then she smiled at him .
Where are the women ?
If you eat that you will die .
What is missing ?
Can you call me a taxi ?
Nobody knows why he left the town .
You have to help .
We &apos;re interested .
I know Tom is fine .
Everyone is ready .
We can &apos;t wait .
How am I supposed to eat ?
If I were a bird , I would fly to you .
Let &apos;s play something .
Where do you usually eat lunch ?
Take my advice .
Tom arrived too early .
I don &apos;t know him at all .
I went there to see her .
Tom looks busy .
It &apos;s probably true .
No one is listening to me .
Please hurry .
If you need my advice , I &apos;d be glad to give it to you .
I don &apos;t want to have kids , and I don &apos;t want to get married .
Why is that here ?
Tom has this large room to himself .
You &apos;re not telling me the whole truth .
Tom is the only friend I have .
How did Tom and Mary meet ?
I &apos;ve received your letter .
I have a pain in my back .
Did Tom find you ?
There &apos;s a cat in my house .
Tom managed to finish his homework quickly .
This is his car , I think .
Tom seems to know exactly what he &apos;s doing .
I don &apos;t see why Tom wanted me to be here today .
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
I go to church every day .
Tom is the one I want to go to Boston with .
Is it Christmas again already ?
He can &apos;t be ill .
Tom would be my first choice .
Tom can play the guitar .
Tom and Mary are trying to sell their house .
Tom has to go .
I have two cars .
There is one apple on the desk .
I &apos;m getting out of here .
Is anybody hurt ?
Tom has a beautiful voice .
Can you help ?
Tom came over and helped me .
No one knows how it works .
He was alone in the house .
I &apos;m the last one who saw Tom .
They &apos;re after you .
Come quickly !
This is very good .
Tom has a map .
Tom didn &apos;t have a problem with that .
I hope that she will help me .
Tom suggested that we travel together .
My sister has three times as many books as I do .
She &apos;s too young to get a driver &apos;s license .
I don &apos;t want to spend any more time in Boston .
I &apos;m not doing great .
Tom didn &apos;t answer the phone .
Tom speaks broken French .
I remember what he said .
I have read the book before .
I know what I &apos;d say .
I thought you &apos;d understand .
I want to learn French .
I have no plans for tonight .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what he needs to do .
Tom didn &apos;t keep Mary waiting too long .
Is Tom back yet ?
There was a small box inside the big box .
Tom can sing very well .
Tom is better off than he used to be .
Tom wants a new hat .
I usually go to sleep very early .
I don &apos;t understand .
How are you going to stop Tom ?
Tom showed me the letter .
I have a week to do my homework .
I &apos;m used to being tired .
There &apos;s been no one here .
I still haven &apos;t found my keys .
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do that .
Tom gave me that book .
You stole my idea .
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
I &apos;ve still got work to do .
It is hot in this room .
We should &apos;ve done this earlier .
We won &apos;t let it happen again .
Tom wants to be rich .
His father died last year .
Tom worked through the night .
Thanks . You &apos;ve been a big help .
Do you want this job ?
It &apos;s the only thing we can do .
Let &apos;s not bother Tom .
Tom should &apos;ve been home from school hours ago .
Maybe I don &apos;t love you .
I &apos;m here , aren &apos;t I ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been here in a long time .
What do women want ?
She looked as if she had been sick for a long time .
Why are they saying that ?
When did Tom buy his car ?
It happens now and then .
Mary is Tom &apos;s wife .
I &apos;m good at this .
I &apos;m not sure .
Tom lives in a small village .
I have to sell my house .
Who hit you ?
Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
My problem is I &apos;m too busy .
We should &apos;ve done that earlier .
We know how Tom is .
You &apos;ll need to do that sooner or later .
I &apos;m taking the week off .
Tom and Mary both work eight hours a day .
Tom is too busy to come .
What do they sell ?
You didn &apos;t break the law .
That doesn &apos;t happen very often .
I &apos;d love to know how that happened .
Tom has a lawyer .
Tom pretended he didn &apos;t care .
Tom has nothing .
It &apos;s a fish .
I didn &apos;t know the woman at all .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you so soon .
You don &apos;t have to do this .
He was in good health last summer .
Tom drank milk .
Tom is scared , but Mary isn &apos;t .
You may go if you choose .
I only know what Tom told me .
When is school out ?
He was the only man .
Tom wrote something on a piece of paper .
Tom is the only one in our family who can speak French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want that .
Tom was last .
I didn &apos;t want to dance with Tom .
I believe this is mine .
I got up earlier than usual .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a family .
He &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I &apos;m not coming .
I &apos;m the only person who can show you how to do that .
I do realize that .
I &apos;ll buy you a beer .
I must have lost it .
I don &apos;t know why it happened .
Nobody noticed me .
We &apos;ll never have to do this again .
I don &apos;t want to eat here .
I want to take Tom with me .
I didn &apos;t know about it until I read the paper .
I can be there in 30 minutes .
We &apos;ll go after we eat .
Tom makes me better .
He was surprised to learn this .
I took off my hat and entered the church .
I wanted to help , but there was nothing I could do .
She felt lonely when all her friends had gone home .
Her heart broke when her husband died .
I have a couple of questions I &apos;d like to ask .
You can &apos;t leave me .
When did you start studying French ?
I &apos;m not angry at you .
What &apos;s on TV now ?
I work hard at a hotel every day .
I never leave home without it .
You should wash your hair .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to go to the concert .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is .
They &apos;re brother and sister .
Those glasses suit you .
That would take too long .
How long have we been here ?
I am a student .
Tom wasn &apos;t there last week .
Who else was in here ?
Tom was worried that he might be late .
You &apos;re not a doctor .
Tom is extremely lucky .
I thought Tom might do that .
He was satisfied with his new car .
I &apos;m here for a meeting .
I wonder whether Tom is really in Australia .
I want a girlfriend .
I need some of your time .
It may rain tomorrow .
Tom won &apos;t be coming to our party .
I think I ate a little too much today .
We have to do something to stop this from happening again .
He stuck to his promise .
You are very rich .
I can &apos;t go out , because I was injured a week ago in an accident .
You were there for Tom when he needed you .
I want you to have this .
How big is Tom &apos;s house ?
I &apos;ve got a little job for you .
Tom said he was going to help Mary .
You can &apos;t win every time .
I &apos;m not feeling very well .
Tom looked at Mary , but said nothing .
How do you say that in French ?
You can &apos;t afford not to believe me .
You should really drink less coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary what had happened .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three days .
If you need my help , please let me know .
We &apos;ve been there before .
I think that he will succeed .
Tom spoke to Mary for the first time yesterday .
She was alone there .
I would like a cup of coffee .
That never should &apos;ve happened .
This is one of the fish that Tom caught .
It &apos;s better to take your time at this job than to hurry and make mistakes .
I speak French with Tom and Mary .
We shouldn &apos;t have let Tom go .
Tom probably wanted to just stay at home and go to sleep .
Tom got in his car and drove off .
Please let me know what you want .
Can you come to the party ?
Mary is a girl .
I am eating fruit .
I hope nobody saw you doing that .
He is now on his own .
Would you like to play soccer with us ?
Tom says he eats more when he &apos;s sad .
Tom brought Mary a small gift .
I can &apos;t come today or tomorrow either .
He thinks he knows everything .
I &apos;m worried about Tom being alone .
No one seems to know where Tom went .
It was not so simple to write a letter in English .
I am through with my work .
He always leaves home at seven .
We &apos;re just friends ?
I &apos;ll go with Tom and Mary .
There &apos;s nothing left to drink .
He wondered why she did that .
They don &apos;t know my name .
Many things have changed in the last five years .
Can I have your telephone number ?
Make sure Tom gets this .
How does he go to school ?
Tom knew Mary was hungry .
My parents call me up every day .
Don &apos;t call me up after ten o &apos;clock .
I won &apos;t leave you behind .
What a beautiful house !
Tom was waiting for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his parents to find out that he was drunk .
Have you ever heard her play the piano ?
I thought that you &apos;d be ready .
I don &apos;t understand what this means at all .
It &apos;s a matter of time .
It is going to rain soon .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t hungry .
His story can &apos;t be true .
Maybe they &apos;re busy .
Tom comes here every three days .
I wonder why Tom said that .
He was sick last week .
I know who likes Tom .
I want you to think about this .
Whose wine is this ?
You may have it .
I won &apos;t hurt you .
I learned to read in school .
The cat is playing with the ball .
He asked her to read it for him .
Please bring me the book next time you come .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t love you .
Mary looks like her mother .
I like being with you .
I didn &apos;t get his joke .
Tom did everything he promised to do .
Your father loves you .
Do you want to see Tom ?
Now is the time .
You are impossible .
Tom loves to read .
My uncle is rich .
We &apos;re going home .
I &apos;ve never seen them before in my life .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat .
I &apos;m nervous now .
Why do you want to learn French ?
How exactly do you do that ?
Tom loves animals .
You &apos;re not worried about the test , are you ?
I &apos;m afraid it will rain .
He was the last to leave .
Don &apos;t tell me what to eat .
You are drunk !
I &apos;m not sure about it .
This is where Tom used to live .
You &apos;re a good person .
You can play outside if you want .
This book is too difficult to read in a week .
What exactly is it that you want me to say ?
I didn &apos;t think it was a big deal .
I have another sister .
I felt hungry .
Would you like bread ?
I &apos;m very cold .
I should &apos;ve told you everything earlier .
Is this a good time to buy a house ?
I love kids .
Tom asked Mary what kind of music she liked to listen to .
Tom wondered why Mary didn &apos;t like him .
This is our only chance .
Why does everything happen to me ?
Tom arrived very late .
When her mother came , she pretended to be studying .
Tom knows where you are .
He seems to have been rich .
I don &apos;t know if I can ever trust you again .
I think there &apos;s someone out there .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Tom made a joke about it .
A beautiful woman like you shouldn &apos;t be eating alone .
Who said that it would be easy ?
The cat is looking at the fish .
The cat loves playing in the garden .
What will become of the children now that both parents are dead ?
Tom is better at doing that than me .
I don &apos;t think Tom has ever done that by himself .
Is there anything Tom can &apos;t do ?
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be early .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to talk about that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom never came .
Have you already met her ?
Tom has started playing the guitar again .
Tom thinks it will rain tomorrow .
It happens all the time .
Take me home with you .
Is Tom going to do that or not ?
I did not play tennis yesterday .
I don &apos;t know whether he will come or not .
What are these ?
He showed me his new car .
It sounds like you &apos;re having fun .
I don &apos;t like men like him .
I wish you were here with me now .
Are you hungry ?
Would you mind if I took a break ?
Tom asked us what we wanted to do .
He can speak only a little English .
Tom knows what &apos;s expected .
Tom told me that he won &apos;t tell Mary what happened .
Christmas is soon , isn &apos;t it ?
I let the cat out of the house .
Tom died in his sleep .
I just don &apos;t feel safe here anymore .
Tom has never stolen money his whole life .
In this company , there are more women than men .
Tom said to give you this .
Tom didn &apos;t get everything he wanted .
I am going to play soccer tomorrow .
I &apos;m probably wrong .
I told Tom that the party wouldn &apos;t be much fun .
There is no other way .
Don &apos;t go home yet .
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents ?
He &apos;d never let me drive his car .
He pretended not to hear me .
Don &apos;t worry about me .
I should &apos;ve been there .
That &apos;s the way things were back then .
Tom wanted to leave , but Mary wanted to stay a little longer .
That &apos;s all I can tell you .
Where are your brothers ?
What &apos;ll you do there ?
I watch TV all day .
I was not disappointed .
Who was the girl you were talking to ?
Tom is hiding something from me .
He had one daughter .
The night &apos;s still young .
We study French at school .
Tom told everyone .
Did you actually see the accident ?
We &apos;d better go home now .
Is he right ?
I &apos;ll be absent tomorrow .
It was impossible for him to solve the problem .
I &apos;m not saying that .
We &apos;ll take good care of Tom .
Why is Tom going ?
The boy sitting over there is Tom .
I have already read the book .
I &apos;ll never go out with Tom again .
I &apos;m an old woman .
Tom didn &apos;t read the newspaper yesterday .
We &apos;re out of beer .
Are these the glasses you &apos;re looking for ?
I thought that he would come .
Give me those .
I have a bicycle .
I know him only by name .
Let &apos;s go now .
Are you through with your work ?
Was it cold yesterday ?
Can you come at nine ?
Don &apos;t be so sure .
That &apos;ll be great .
He asked me what I needed .
Tom never left .
I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s right or not .
Tom is good at this .
When do you need it ?
Why are you so busy ?
We don &apos;t want to lose you .
Who said you could do that ?
Why did you go to Boston ?
Leave me alone .
Are you sure you don &apos;t need my help ?
Tom arrived ten minutes ago , but I haven &apos;t yet seen him .
Tom isn &apos;t a very good cook .
They don &apos;t have to go to school today .
I couldn &apos;t stop laughing .
I think he &apos;s right .
Tom didn &apos;t have to wait that long .
We need to talk to you about Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do that again .
That &apos;s a problem .
Is his story true ?
I would rather read a book at home than go out tonight .
Tom wants a word with you .
English is the world &apos;s language .
Tom is up there .
I &apos;m living in a small town .
Tom is coming home .
He is in a bad mood .
I enjoy swimming .
The problem is that we don &apos;t know where Tom is .
I didn &apos;t want you to read that .
You &apos;ve been here way too long .
Where does Tom want to go ?
How old are your children now ?
I go for a walk every morning .
Tom knows Mary lied .
I haven &apos;t really told you anything you shouldn &apos;t have already known .
I &apos;m going to see Tom today .
It looks fine .
I have things to do .
Have you finished reading the novel ?
I &apos;m coming to your party .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be here .
I thought you &apos;d want this one .
Tom is no longer my boyfriend .
I &apos;m in my apartment .
What does Tom think about that ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want coffee ?
Are you as tired as I am ?
It &apos;s not what you think .
How old is your little brother ?
It is fun to play baseball .
Do it by all means .
I &apos;m going to sleep on it .
Tom says that he hasn &apos;t made up his mind yet .
Tom , what are you doing ?
I thought Tom had stopped smoking .
I wouldn &apos;t do that to you .
Tom is watching TV now .
Tom lives in a very large house .
Tom may stay .
Why would you want to be a teacher ?
He made us work till late at night .
Tom can &apos;t talk to you right now .
I don &apos;t like him .
Tom is doing great .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where his umbrella is .
You seem tired . You should go to bed .
Tom seems to be expecting something to happen .
That &apos;ll never change .
That &apos;s for Tom .
I &apos;ll go to the park .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to say .
My daughter wants a piano .
Some of you already know me .
We need to fix this problem now .
He might not be happy .
We should have gotten married .
May I go with Tom ?
He moved out of his parents &apos; place .
I didn &apos;t give them anything .
How old is your sister ?
It isn &apos;t a secret .
Everyone was confused .
If you have something to say , say it .
Tom didn &apos;t think the rain would last so long .
I miss my parents so much .
They know I know .
If he doesn &apos;t come , what will you do then ?
Tom might be right .
Tom became quiet .
I came by bus .
I &apos;m going to make you happy .
Do you like to live in the country ?
We know what needs to be done .
A man came to see him .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking you .
You sure eat a lot .
Don &apos;t forget to buy bread .
Aren &apos;t you coming to the party tomorrow ?
Tom left about thirty minutes ago .
Bring me my clothes .
Tom &apos;s somewhere in the park .
I &apos;m proud to be Canadian .
I want to play on the computer .
I knew that Tom was from Boston .
His mother didn &apos;t want to do it .
Are you afraid of me ?
The room was dark .
What do you want from Tom ?
Tom put on a tie .
I know why we &apos;re doing this .
Tom has a different job now .
Where &apos;s everybody else ?
Tom wants to see me .
You can still get that finished before 2 : 30 .
It &apos;s not going to be hard to do this .
I want to tell you the truth .
She doesn &apos;t want him to go to Boston .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook this well , Tom .
Can you eat these ?
I want to spend all my time with you .
Call me once you &apos;ve arrived .
She is not up yet .
That is my school .
Tom was born there .
Tom knows that I &apos;m Canadian .
We &apos;ll sing .
Tom walked into the room .
We know why you did it .
I saw someone .
Why did he come here ?
We should probably go home .
Tom tried to get Mary to help John .
Are you thinking about getting a job ?
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston .
What was your name ?
Tom knew no one .
This winter is warm .
Did Tom ask us to wait ?
It &apos;s very dangerous to swim in this river .
I must have made a mistake somewhere .
I can handle it myself .
Come in .
Come to me .
Her story is true .
Can I say this one last time ?
I &apos;ve bought a car .
This word is not in common use .
I must know the truth about Tom .
I know a man who can speak French well .
How long does it take to get from here to the station ?
It &apos;s you who are confused .
Tom might be wrong .
Tell me what really happened .
I put on my glasses .
I just wanted to be sure .
I see a boy .
If the weather is fine , I &apos;ll go swimming in the river .
I understand that you and Tom are planning to get married .
You can do better than this .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that again .
May I visit your home one of these days ?
Why are you in my house ?
We don &apos;t have any more bread .
Do you want in on this ?
I &apos;m not mad . I &apos;m just disappointed .
Tom gave me a book .
I want to play .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I &apos;m Canadian .
Tom may be there .
I &apos;m certain .
I &apos;m tired already .
That &apos;s too good a story to be true .
Tom isn &apos;t like you .
How is it going ?
Tom is going to come on Monday .
Tom left before I arrived .
Tom came to help .
Let me take a picture of you .
I &apos;m sick of talking about it .
It doesn &apos;t need to be white , but I &apos;d prefer white .
Tom wondered how deep the river was .
I know Tom is a doctor .
I think so .
Tom had no idea of what was going on .
He cannot stop him .
I don &apos;t care what you think of me .
Are you still awake ?
I can carry that for you if you &apos;d like me to .
I am afraid I must be going now .
Tom seldom smiled .
I &apos;m very fat .
He isn &apos;t here because he &apos;s ill .
Tom seems really happy .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a new pair of glasses .
She &apos;s our teacher .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here today .
I don &apos;t do that as often as Tom does .
Get out of my way .
Tom is confused .
Tom and Mary are going to get married .
I am to blame .
Do you want your coat back ?
She didn &apos;t like him at first .
I go to work by car every day .
I don &apos;t think I have the time to help you today .
Tom &apos;s got school tomorrow .
The store &apos;s closed .
We know each other quite well .
She was born lucky .
Tom is a personal friend .
Your father would have been very proud of you .
This house is not very large .
Now &apos;s not a good time .
Tom thinks he &apos;s going to die soon .
I saw Tom doing that yesterday .
Tom came inside .
Tom had a problem with Mary .
I &apos;ll tell you how to do it .
Is Tom crazy ?
Tom said he &apos;s looking for Mary .
The store is close to my house .
Is that what I think it is ?
I &apos;m certain that he has finished .
Tom looks lonely .
Let me try .
It could have been me .
These are animals .
Tell me it &apos;s not true .
Tom didn &apos;t know what would happen to him .
You must tell no one .
Tom asked Mary what kind of food she liked to eat .
Tom didn &apos;t come home .
Please tell me how to do that .
Tom has one for you .
It &apos;s six o &apos;clock already .
Tom has been lying all along .
Tom is about as old as Mary is .
Tom and Mary are going to name their daughter Alice .
How long have you been a doctor here ?
I don &apos;t mind if the weather is hot .
Mary is as tall as Tom is .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t love him .
I thought I &apos;d left it at home .
I had to stay at home .
Tom is younger than you think he is .
How was your birthday ?
Tom &apos;s French has gotten better .
She was advised by him not to go there by herself .
Could you come and see me tomorrow ?
You don &apos;t need to explain it to me . I already understand it .
That &apos;s just what one would expect of him .
Where do you go to school ?
Is that book for me ?
We &apos;re going to take good care of Tom .
Tom could tell Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom wants us to leave .
It seems that Tom has been here .
I think Tom will listen to me .
They can &apos;t believe it .
I can &apos;t get along with him .
We can &apos;t do it without you .
I really do like you .
Tom ate something .
What can you tell me about Tom ?
Tom asked Mary about her job in Boston .
I have a feeling that she will come today .
This really is something .
Tom says he &apos;s disappointed .
Tom is the kind of man I like .
Here are your keys .
I should talk to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand any French .
I have money enough to buy it .
When will they arrive ?
Let &apos;s eat .
He hasn &apos;t written to them in a long time .
What beautiful flowers !
She first met him in Boston .
What should Tom have done ?
Where has Tom gone ?
I &apos;ve changed my mind again .
We want what we want .
Tom asked Mary &apos;s father to buy him a ticket .
Tom never forgot .
Who &apos;s watching ?
He comes to see my son now and then .
Nobody taught me .
When is Tom &apos;s birthday ?
It &apos;s lunch time .
I want to hear you say it .
I don &apos;t see why .
My family thinks I &apos;m rich .
I drank the water .
Tom wanted to turn himself in to the police .
We should wait for help .
Tom got out of bed and put his clothes on .
Tom said Mary isn &apos;t happy .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can drive or not .
We went shopping yesterday .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
She opened her eyes .
Tom can &apos;t hear a word you &apos;re saying .
I thought I could do it .
I didn &apos;t have to do anything .
Tom managed to sell his car for a lot of money .
I like all of them .
Tom was on his way to church .
That &apos;s what I would do in your place .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t know what was going on .
I never told anyone .
He was too angry to speak .
I &apos;ve never seen one before .
Do as you think fit .
Who did this ?
He should have the right to decide for himself .
Is it about ten o &apos;clock ?
Tom advised Mary not to do it .
All of this is because of you .
If the shop is closed today , I &apos;ll try again tomorrow .
She advised him to go to the police .
We need to get help .
I wasn &apos;t the one who wrote this letter .
You need to be careful .
I would do anything for love .
I hardly ever walk to work .
Tom didn &apos;t think that would ever happen .
This bag is not small .
Tom isn &apos;t impressed .
Nobody knows where Tom is .
He doesn &apos;t want kids .
Your shoes are here .
He has lost face .
You look like your father looked thirty years ago .
Tom knows that I don &apos;t like him .
Perhaps you should stop .
Let Tom eat whatever he wants .
How does Tom feel about it ?
You &apos;re not as young as Tom .
Tom was already drunk .
Is there anything that we can do to help ?
What &apos;s the big idea ?
Don &apos;t leave them alone .
The bird is dead .
We &apos;re doing nothing .
You don &apos;t know what I want .
Tom isn &apos;t happy to be here .
Tom did it on purpose .
Tom paid a lot of money for that guitar .
That &apos;s the way I like it .
Tom didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
Tom got up and left the room .
Where &apos;s your money ?
You should take a vacation .
I don &apos;t have anything to say on that subject .
I &apos;ve been waiting for years .
I can &apos;t believe I forgot .
Tom thought it was stupid .
I &apos;ll pay for it .
Could you please give this to Tom ?
How many hours of sleep do you need ?
Tom is in his office at his desk .
Tom and Mary can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
I &apos;d like to ask a favor of you .
There was no one left but me .
Have you done all your homework ?
Everybody loves her .
Tom was thirty when he died .
I still think Tom will win .
Tom said he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself .
I must be going now .
I didn &apos;t go to school last Monday .
I guess I &apos;ll find out soon enough .
Tom looks much better now .
You look as healthy as ever .
Are you still busy ?
How is it going with your family ?
Can I bring you anything else ?
They didn &apos;t tell me so .
This isn &apos;t real .
It &apos;s free .
Don &apos;t let children play in the road .
The apple was eaten by me .
Tom and Mary were busy .
There &apos;s your friend .
Where &apos;s your suitcase ?
Tom wasn &apos;t bad .
Come on .
Tom worked for almost three hours .
Tom got paid .
She kept her eyes closed .
I &apos;m eating .
Can you start tomorrow ?
It &apos;s not too hot .
My mother loves me .
Is there something I can do to help ?
He is good at singing .
Have you ever been to Germany ?
Tom told me that his father had passed away .
He has a daughter who is pretty .
Who &apos;s in charge ?
I have brothers .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where .
Tom is waiting for us in the car .
Tom is on his way to Australia .
We are worried about you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand Mary .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t have enough money on me at this time .
I &apos;m glad you came today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
I know what it &apos;s about .
I am more beautiful than you .
How did you see that ?
Someone must &apos;ve left the window open .
I can &apos;t give it to you .
I know who she is .
Tom doesn &apos;t want his parents to find out .
I want to see it for myself .
Nobody came .
I have a decision to make .
When was the last time you slept in this room ?
Have you ever seen Tom without his glasses on ?
English is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
I think I &apos;ve heard enough .
Are you going to be long ?
I want to know what love is .
You can &apos;t talk to me like this .
Tom is impressed .
That &apos;s how it was .
He is very fast .
It is pretty cold .
It &apos;s raining here .
Tom is still asleep .
I &apos;m going to get us a drink .
It &apos;s too fast .
Tom told me that you speak French .
Who &apos;d kiss Tom ?
He was sitting in the library when I saw him .
Do as I told you .
I &apos;m going to help you do it .
I have to win .
I don &apos;t see anything .
I &apos;ll go get it .
You haven &apos;t even tried .
Where &apos;s your sister ?
I have no family .
I &apos;m giving it back .
What do you want to do with it ?
I can &apos;t stand .
I knew you would get it .
Tom was mad .
The village is now different from what it used to be .
You can go home now .
There is a man at the door .
She didn &apos;t go there yesterday .
I &apos;d like to move to the country .
What &apos;ll we tell the others ?
Tom tried to make Mary happy , but he couldn &apos;t .
He &apos;s rich rather than poor .
I don &apos;t know for sure .
It seems that everybody likes golf .
She &apos;s nice to me .
Tom must &apos;ve known that would happen .
I &apos;m afraid of death .
Tom likes anything sweet .
Tom had no idea who Mary &apos;s father was .
I think Tom did well .
I said I wasn &apos;t ready .
Tom was busy , so he couldn &apos;t help us .
Let &apos;s discuss the problem .
Tom knows how to get there .
I met your friend .
I told Tom you would probably like to see that movie .
There &apos;s someone at the door .
I have a solution .
He leaves for New York next week .
Why don &apos;t you do that ?
The pizza &apos;s here !
He &apos;s still alive .
I &apos;m no longer hungry .
I &apos;d rather drink coffee than tea .
I &apos;m losing weight .
I &apos;m doing this for you .
I hope that he will come .
He can &apos;t do that .
Everything seemed OK .
I don &apos;t understand him sometimes .
This is not my problem .
He says he met my father .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished his homework yet .
I found it hard to close the door .
These came for you .
I want to live in Boston .
What is it you do again ?
What &apos;s going to happen next ?
I &apos;m the one who should apologize .
Is this pencil yours ?
I really don &apos;t know how I can thank you .
Tom won &apos;t be here tonight .
I &apos;m not doing this for me .
I have a house not too far from here .
Tom stayed in Boston for three months .
You &apos;re my friends .
I &apos;ve got something I want to show you .
I like to make people happy .
I think the same as you .
My name should be on that list .
I have a family .
Tom got mad .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s address .
Tom says he still has no idea where Mary is .
You won &apos;t believe this .
Tom has a message for Mary .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know any French .
How long were you at school today ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
He never asked me .
I don &apos;t want it .
He played tennis yesterday .
It &apos;s not so far .
I remember seeing him once .
I &apos;d like you to come with us .
That &apos;s not what Tom wants to do .
I &apos;ve got nothing left .
The answer was easy .
What has Tom done now ?
It &apos;s not there .
Tom is my daughter &apos;s best friend .
Is the boss there ?
I know only this .
Tom said that he decided it was too hard to do .
Tom got on his horse .
I won &apos;t do that again .
I don &apos;t know who &apos;s coming .
Did you get her letter ?
Tom said Mary may do that .
Tom arrived after Mary had left .
We don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s true .
Do you have something to write with ?
I &apos;m a teacher .
I &apos;m glad I don &apos;t need that .
Tom said it was a problem .
Tom has no idea what Mary is thinking .
Tom didn &apos;t seem very interested in going to the concert with us .
Tom told me that you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
I remember seeing him .
Did you see her there ?
This isn &apos;t worth it .
I think you might be right .
Why isn &apos;t anybody doing anything ?
Is Tom better than Mary ?
I was the only man there .
I don &apos;t even know your name .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll have to call it a day .
I think I know what it is .
I already did that .
I want to go to school .
Tom has no money in his pocket .
I like dogs and my sister likes cats .
I want to help you with your homework .
I left home at seven .
Tom got the job .
Ask Tom .
There is something I must know .
They know Tom .
We &apos;ll go on foot .
It is almost three .
We &apos;re going to see Tom .
He asked his teacher several questions .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants .
Tom is pleased with his new car .
Tom hardly said a word to anybody .
Tell Tom that when he &apos;s finished , he can leave .
Where &apos;s the hospital ?
I &apos;ll be careful .
I don &apos;t mind .
Your French is getting much better .
I waited for you .
French isn &apos;t spoken here .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom that I knew you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my family .
Tom gave that to me .
You don &apos;t seem to be yourself these days .
Tom &apos;s scared .
How could you do that ?
I knew that already .
Where were you on your birthday ?
It &apos;s a bad time .
What &apos;s this room ?
Tom is afraid .
Did Tom go to Boston ?
Would you lend me some money ?
I don &apos;t want dinner .
How long was Tom sick ?
You &apos;re going to love living here .
Can anybody help me ?
What do you see in Tom ?
My apartment is in that building .
Could I get some water , please ?
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think Alice was beautiful .
Would you like to travel to the United States ?
Tom is reading .
I want my whole family to be proud of me .
Mary is my daughter .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us either .
How does Tom make money ?
I &apos;m convinced my son is innocent .
Please tell them where they need to go .
Tom knows her .
I heard you last night , Tom .
Tom was crazy about Mary .
I &apos;ll give Tom a chance .
I could barely sleep .
I can run .
I &apos;ll deal with this problem as soon as I can .
Mary isn &apos;t my sister .
What &apos;s the difference ?
You may ask any questions you wish .
Tom isn &apos;t like people say he is .
That is what I want to know .
Tom believed Mary .
I could never give up meat .
She went on working till he called her .
I &apos;m taking the train to Boston .
Who goes there ?
I don &apos;t like eggs .
Thank you for the present you gave my son .
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s boss , aren &apos;t you ?
Who has it now ?
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
Tom works very hard .
Tom went to Boston to study music .
I have never been to Europe .
You owe me an explanation .
Mary is Tom &apos;s only daughter .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will leave Boston .
The concert hasn &apos;t started yet .
I don &apos;t know what to do next .
Tom invited me to a party at his house .
What did they find ?
Where &apos;s your mother ?
How &apos;s the water ?
Would you please shut the window ?
You should leave at once .
Can I have some more tea ?
I must open the window .
I &apos;m surprised to hear you say that .
Tom had many friends .
I have no idea of what to do .
I &apos;m going to get you .
My plan for the summer is to go to Europe .
Those are my books .
Let the boy go .
I know what I will do .
I &apos;ll keep my eyes shut .
They &apos;re not there .
I didn &apos;t understand anything , either .
I think Tom knows .
Tom wanted to die .
There &apos;s a telephone in my room .
I know Tom &apos;s family .
Tom gets home every Monday at about 2 : 30 .
What &apos;s wrong , Tom ?
She gave him something to drink .
They &apos;re home .
Tom needs to call a doctor .
I like my job very much .
Are you at Tom &apos;s ?
My uncle has three children .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about Tom .
Don &apos;t you know Tom ?
Tom knows everybody .
This one &apos;s on us , Tom .
Did Tom call you ?
We don &apos;t know where he is .
Tom says he &apos;s on his way back home .
Are you bored right now ?
Do you think I &apos;m crazy ?
What were you and Tom doing yesterday ?
That man is Tom .
I didn &apos;t know you were that kind of a person .
We stole it .
A lot can happen in three hours .
Are you sure you haven &apos;t forgotten anything ?
Let Tom sleep .
Why aren &apos;t you ready ?
I don &apos;t know what else to do .
Tom has a new girlfriend already .
Let &apos;s see if Tom knows more than we do .
Why do you think I &apos;m here ?
I &apos;m from Boston .
There is little wine left in the bottle .
I &apos;m sorry I said that .
Tom left his key on the desk , as he usually does .
I bought the book for ten dollars .
I &apos;m sure that you will succeed .
Tom only does what he has to do .
They &apos;re cold .
I didn &apos;t know that you could do that .
You have to go get it .
Tom got very mad .
We do love it .
Tom didn &apos;t say that .
It &apos;s already dark outside .
Can Tom read and write Japanese ?
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
You can &apos;t blame this on us .
Can you make us some breakfast ?
I went to bed a little later than usual .
He died a few days later .
This camera is small , but very good .
I haven &apos;t changed my mind .
Nobody seems interested in dancing with me .
He likes music very much .
I saw Tom do it .
I don &apos;t want to live here .
You don &apos;t have to go out with Tom .
Where &apos;s my family ?
The only girl who &apos;s ever kissed Tom is Mary .
Tom knows what &apos;s really going on .
They really did it .
How many students are there in your school ?
Take these with you .
We shouldn &apos;t lose hope .
He can &apos;t handle it .
Tom has to finish this work by 2 : 30 .
Please help Tom .
I &apos;m really old .
Are Mary and Alice really sisters ?
It looks like Tom is feeling much better today .
What happened in Boston ?
If I were rich , I would buy it .
They &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;ve got something you both need .
Tom &apos;s glad .
Tom &apos;s car is on fire .
We can &apos;t stop now .
I decided to stay one more day .
I already said that .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .
He did the work better than anyone else .
I really should know the answer .
Tom was drunk .
I made him carry the suitcase .
My father bought a new car .
They believe you .
Why can &apos;t you accept me as I am ?
Tom is the kind of person who always has to have the last word .
Tom told me to meet him at his house .
Don &apos;t you want to hear my side of the story ?
Tom said that he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
Tom told me not to drive too fast .
We have two kids .
I saw Tom and Mary .
I &apos;d like to do that .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what happened .
Whose office is this ?
I don &apos;t think you believe that .
That was our plan .
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t well .
I didn &apos;t mean it .
Did you get the letter I sent you ?
Tom always looked happy , but never was .
Tom wants to take it .
I &apos;m too busy to talk with Tom right now .
He didn &apos;t want to sell the book .
You were meant for me .
I think we have enough time .
I want Tom to like you .
Tom refused to pay his bill .
I don &apos;t know who did it .
This is the best camera in the store .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston with me ?
He promised to write every day .
Tom isn &apos;t my boss anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary either .
Tom has always been strong .
The meeting is ten days away .
I love your car .
Will you give me a ride to my hotel ?
Tom stayed calm .
That &apos;ll pass .
Tom is asleep .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at this .
Would you like some fruit ?
It does not have to be this way .
That &apos;ll help .
I opened the window .
I have a message .
That old man caught a large fish .
We caught some large fish there .
Tom has had a bad week .
You should wait until Monday to do that .
Tom and Mary seem so happy together .
You can ask the child who &apos;s playing over there .
Tom was a good father .
They &apos;re doing OK .
Tom gets mad very easily .
When was she born ?
Have you ever seen anything like this before ?
It would &apos;ve been so easy .
Who else was at the party ?
She takes a taxi from the station to her house .
I don &apos;t know why no one saw Tom .
She will come soon .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t have very much money on him right now .
This is Tom .
How come you know so much about Tom ?
Do you know about that ?
Let &apos;s sing a song .
Tom wanted to go to Australia .
Are you really a doctor ?
No animals are to be found on the island .
I wonder what it could be .
It is time to go .
She is only a child .
How much money have you got ?
She brought up the three children alone .
We were not to blame for the accident .
I &apos;m fed up with English .
You don &apos;t have to do it now .
He was in America at that time .
I know how to solve the problem , but I &apos;ve been asked not to tell you .
He went abroad .
I &apos;ll love you forever .
I wonder whether the weather will hold .
I gave Tom Mary &apos;s phone number .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom again .
They go to church on Sunday .
You are very early this morning .
Tom sat near the fire , playing his guitar .
Have you told me everything ?
I love to go to the movies .
Is Tom Canadian ?
I think Tom is kind .
Tom has to give Mary something .
I have another question .
She talks as if she knew everything .
Do you like fish ?
She took her book .
I &apos;m good at Japanese .
Where is everybody ?
That &apos;s not true .
Tom said he read a book about this ship .
He did not say a word to us .
Isn &apos;t that right ?
Every student has to leave school by six .
I was born in Boston .
Tom knew a lot .
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself .
Tom will be here in a while .
Do you know anyone who speaks French ?
Tom has been in there for hours .
We &apos;ve been up all night .
I wish I had more money .
I told Tom a joke .
I don &apos;t know Tom as well as I know you .
She is very angry with me .
Why didn &apos;t Tom stop ?
You and I are good friends .
That was of great help to me .
Please read that book .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on going by himself .
Is Tom serious ?
The cat is under the chair .
I don &apos;t like this one .
Tom wanted to be there .
Tom &apos;s awake .
I don &apos;t know anyone by that name .
I don &apos;t really know why , but they don &apos;t like me .
What do you think &apos;s out there ?
Just go away .
We believe that it was Tom that killed Mary .
I wish that had never happened .
You can &apos;t give up on Tom .
I wasn &apos;t ready .
I asked Tom to come in .
Here &apos;s a picture of Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t like going to school .
Ask Tom not to wait for me .
It &apos;s the best house in town .
Are they Canadian ?
Please tell me the truth .
I was off duty .
Don &apos;t let him do it alone .
Do you know why that happens ?
Tom is still too young to drink beer .
Tom is my grandfather .
I could fire you for that .
This one &apos;s from me .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t call me that .
I didn &apos;t want to say anything , but I had no choice .
I hope you slept well .
Whose letter is this ?
What &apos;re you doing about this ?
Tom is as tall as his father .
The town has changed a great deal since then .
Tom works .
I &apos;m going to the police .
What &apos;s in here ?
Why is it that you &apos;re always late ?
How long has Tom studied French ?
Do you think fish can hear ?
It &apos;s one of mine .
Have you finished it ?
He knows my wife .
It &apos;s still possible .
These apples are very big .
I don &apos;t want to be married to you anymore .
I can &apos;t hear it .
Tom is just like us .
That could take hours .
How often do you go to Boston ?
Why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
We love it here .
I came here with Tom .
You have to tell me the truth .
Tom had nothing to do with that .
We &apos;re getting tired .
Will the ice bear our weight ?
Did Tom eat dinner ?
Tom has to go to Boston .
I had to stay in bed all day .
I &apos;d like to buy this computer .
My father is a teacher .
We can win .
When did you finish it ?
You took the words right out of my mouth .
That is a pencil .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is mad at me .
Did you bring your family with you ?
Tom is still standing .
There &apos;s nobody in your room .
I don &apos;t see a problem with it .
Tom said that he would be here by 2 : 30 .
Tom was seriously injured in a traffic accident .
She is always kind to everyone .
You are crazy .
He loves me for who I am .
Maybe you should learn how to use a gun .
I &apos;ll let Tom know .
My back hurts .
I &apos;m looking for my watch .
Let me know if there &apos;s anything I can help you with .
The teacher gave us a lot of homework .
Let me help you with your work .
Tom loved Boston .
Tom became very sick .
I waited three hours .
I have a lot of work to finish up before the end of the week .
I went to Tom &apos;s house after school .
Tom is proud of his work .
I really need a job .
He is not a doctor .
I may have to study French .
Are you free tomorrow afternoon ?
Why is Tom &apos;s car still here ?
Do you like my new shoes ?
Tom sat alone on the couch .
What newspaper do you read ?
We need this .
I &apos;d really rather be alone right now .
Tom thinks it &apos;ll be fine .
Let &apos;s begin .
Tom has been gone for a long time .
Tom was the first .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re welcome here .
What you say is true .
Tom didn &apos;t succeed .
Tom is in his office listening to the radio .
I can &apos;t hear a word .
I want to read this book .
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher .
I think that &apos;ll do .
Tom knows he isn &apos;t welcome here .
This should be more than enough .
Tom thinks you want me to pay for it .
I lived in Boston .
They &apos;re both dead .
Tom has to stay in Australia for one more week .
Everything was lost .
I saw Tom walking in the park with a girl I didn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s going to be difficult to find somebody to do that for you .
Tom is very disappointed in Mary .
We could walk there together .
This is how Tom does it .
Can you please leave me alone ?
It &apos;s cold today .
The problem is that my son doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
We can make this work .
I &apos;ve had enough to eat .
What &apos;s Tom good at doing ?
She spoke Japanese well .
I won &apos;t be busy tomorrow .
Where is his family ?
I think you &apos;re drinking out of my glass .
It &apos;s easy for her to make friends .
How &apos;re we doing ?
Tom smiled at Mary as he left the room .
I can &apos;t think of life without you .
I haven &apos;t finished my homework yet .
Mary used to be beautiful .
Tom wondered if Mary would like the gift he bought her .
Please bring it back tomorrow .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
It runs in the family .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Do you want another cup of coffee ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along together .
He didn &apos;t like being poor .
We would be very pleased if you paid us a visit .
I just got home from school .
It &apos;s up to you to decide the matter .
I &apos;ve found a job .
Why do you want this ?
Tom is old .
I &apos;ll give you this money .
Did you find the book you were looking for ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to anybody .
There is no one there .
Why are you in Boston ?
I arrived too early .
This is for you .
Take my car .
How is life ?
Tom &apos;s car is gone .
We want our money back .
Tom thinks Mary is cute .
I &apos;m still in love with him .
He likes music a lot .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
He will be back in a second .
When are they coming ?
He is playing in his room .
You need to apologize .
He did it just for fun .
Tom was quite pleased with himself .
Tom did what he wanted to do .
Please promise you &apos;ll never do that again .
Tom has to make a decision .
Go take a walk .
That was the last time any of us ever saw Tom .
They are sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea .
It &apos;s OK with me if it &apos;s OK with you .
Tom isn &apos;t hungry .
Tom and Mary are here , too .
We don &apos;t like Tom .
Some people never learn .
I told Tom how proud I was of him .
He looks like my father .
Was Tom a teacher ?
What have you got ?
Tom went straight home after school .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
I never thought I &apos;d finish it .
Tom put his glasses on .
Nobody &apos;ll ever find us here .
Give me two minutes .
Tom and I don &apos;t always agree .
He &apos;s looking at you .
That &apos;s me .
Tom almost didn &apos;t catch the bus .
Tom &apos;s correct .
It &apos;s part of the job .
You are always late .
That was not the only problem .
We may be too late .
We &apos;re going to be rich .
Am I supposed to eat this ?
Tom is trying too hard .
It is very cold today , isn &apos;t it ?
Is there anything you want that you don &apos;t have ?
Do we have one ?
Tom looked good today .
Tom and I often go out for pizza after work .
Why do you always talk about Tom ?
We all die sooner or later .
Take whatever you like .
Tom isn &apos;t going to come home .
Is that the train I have to take ?
I promised my parents that I &apos;d study French .
Many of the students were tired .
They had no idea what needed to be done .
Both Tom and I don &apos;t understand French at all .
I wonder if Tom is still outside .
We don &apos;t want that , do we ?
Tom is all right .
I &apos;m sorry , I forgot to do my homework .
Is Tom ready ?
You &apos;ll have to ask someone else .
You don &apos;t have to apologize .
That &apos;s great !
I believe in you .
A person like Tom has probably never kissed anyone other than his mother .
Tom wants to go to Japan .
I know you &apos;re in love with me .
It seemed like a dream to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is called in English .
I need to stop .
Tom thought about it .
Did Tom come home ?
Give me your telephone number .
Tom is my brother .
You know where Tom is .
You have no idea what that means , do you ?
You will be able to see him tomorrow .
His bag was stolen yesterday .
Who &apos;s the little guy ?
Tom always works a lot .
Tom ran off .
You &apos;re going to be a good father .
I think that he is right .
I want to be happy again .
I think they &apos;re students .
He couldn &apos;t convince her of her mistake .
Tom was married to Mary &apos;s sister .
Isn &apos;t it true ?
I have a boyfriend .
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary .
If only I had left home five minutes earlier .
I look forward to meeting you .
Tom has known Mary since he was a little boy .
It didn &apos;t work .
I can afford good food now .
I hope you get well soon .
I can &apos;t swim , but my younger brother can .
You have absolutely no idea how hard it was to convince Tom to help us .
Do you really think that &apos;s true ?
You were our last hope .
Tom was really lucky .
Do you want to stop ?
Tom didn &apos;t change his mind .
Tom is likely to be hungry when he gets home .
Are you still angry with Tom ?
We saw her dance .
You always have to have the last word , don &apos;t you ?
Everything is expensive in London .
What &apos;s up with you ?
I find it difficult to believe .
Be careful up there .
I thought it was worth a try .
Tom will try .
I am going to stay here for a couple of days .
He will be in time for the train .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom , but he said he didn &apos;t want to go with me .
&quot; Do you think he will come ? &quot; &quot; I hope not . &quot;
Tom and Mary are getting married next year .
Tom has a guitar .
I didn &apos;t know why I wasn &apos;t supposed to visit that part of the city .
I want to live like that .
I have something that I want to say to you .
Tom asked Mary to give him some money .
Tom says he thinks it might not be safe to do that .
I have a brother in Boston .
That will not change .
That &apos;s how it is done .
They will help you to get warm .
That &apos;s our secret .
You know his name , don &apos;t you ?
I want to travel to Australia .
Is the meeting today or tomorrow ?
We &apos;re very sorry about that .
Let &apos;s play ball .
I haven &apos;t eaten since breakfast and I &apos;m very hungry .
Tom was born in Australia .
I &apos;ve been waiting for this day to come .
Is today Monday ?
It &apos;s popular with students .
I have to go back to the office .
What has he done to you ?
I have nothing to eat .
You hardly ate anything .
I wasn &apos;t sure what to say .
Tom was in Boston three weeks ago .
I &apos;m having the same problems .
Tom has a big family .
Tell Tom I &apos;m ready .
I should have done this years ago .
She ate her dinner .
I live in a big city .
Tom is waiting for my report .
Take a good look at this .
Tom made only three mistakes .
I have no other choice .
Tom gave me his phone number and told me to call him .
How old do you think I am ?
We often make mistakes .
We know what you want .
He &apos;s in a bad mood .
They &apos;re all going to prison .
We can &apos;t stay here .
Tom is looking good today .
Can you open this for me ?
It may not come to that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to go .
What do you have there ?
We &apos;ll take this .
Tom can &apos;t know the truth .
Most people see only what they want to see .
How much did you have to drink ?
I don &apos;t like that idea much .
It &apos;s no secret .
I &apos;m pretty sure he came late on purpose .
Don &apos;t be crazy .
I &apos;m not worried about it at all .
I don &apos;t have much money on me .
Mary and I were like sisters .
I need you to help me .
I wish I had seen her .
What happened to the money ?
I can give it a try .
You shouldn &apos;t try to do everything by yourself .
Everyone except me knew it .
I found out how to solve the problem .
He had few other friends .
I &apos;m not going to go there again .
I &apos;m very surprised that Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom says he didn &apos;t know Mary was going to have to do that next week .
Didn &apos;t I say that ?
Tom will have an answer for you by next week .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any of us .
That &apos;s a beautiful dress .
I only eat vegetables .
He was like a father to me .
I play tennis every day .
I haven &apos;t asked Tom yet .
I don &apos;t drink .
I think it &apos;s sad to not have any friends .
I play tennis an hour a day .
Your friend is tired .
What kind of place is this ?
Tom said that you stole my money .
Tom told Mary that he was hungry .
Why don &apos;t you and Tom do it ?
Look out your window .
What &apos;re we doing here , Tom ?
I would like to move to Australia .
Is Tom sick ?
How did you break your leg ?
We always want what we don &apos;t have .
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary &apos;s school .
Tom and I became good friends .
She hasn &apos;t come yet .
Would you help Tom find his keys ?
As usual , Tom was late .
Tom told Mary why he was late .
Tom said he thought he knew what the problem was .
Tom goes to school by bus .
They &apos;re afraid of Tom .
That &apos;s a pretty good question .
It was a nice party . You should have come , too .
I have no sisters .
Tom can &apos;t wait until next week .
I know that Tom and Mary are married to each other .
I &apos;ll get these .
You should have come to us .
I will learn .
Here you are , Tom .
We are not speaking .
I feel like I know you .
We put sugar in our tea .
Tom and I often go shopping together .
Tom sold his house .
Do I have to take this medicine ?
She slept for a few hours .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his father .
It &apos;s what I want to do .
Do you want to sleep on the couch ?
Come on , tell me .
You &apos;d better not stay up too late .
That &apos;s no reason to get mad .
Is Tom going to die ?
Is your husband at home ?
The girl under the tree looks sad .
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to see me ?
Tom told everybody he was afraid to do that .
How much do you love Tom ?
Tom had a lot of problems at the school .
Tom didn &apos;t have to eat that if he didn &apos;t want to .
No one loves me .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d believe me .
The bus leaves in about two minutes .
She doesn &apos;t speak English .
Come home early .
It is two o &apos;clock in the morning .
Whose book is that ?
I usually have a glass of milk for breakfast .
Tom is kind to Mary .
You &apos;ll be better soon .
Excuse me , what time is it ?
He looks old , but he hasn &apos;t reached 30 yet .
Tom bought a car last week .
What made you ask that question ?
I love you more than anything in the world .
That &apos;s over .
Tom often talks about golf .
This is not for me .
I wish we could just ask Tom .
Tom became very popular .
We &apos;ve run out of beer .
How does Tom know about that ?
What do you want me to get ?
Mary likes Japan , doesn &apos;t she ?
He speaks English well .
Go ahead .
He has made the same mistake twice .
It &apos;s a small school . Everyone knows everyone .
Tom knows how to speak to children .
We don &apos;t trust Tom .
I was good .
I &apos;m busy doing homework .
I thought Tom was at school .
The time has come .
Has Tom promised to help us ?
How many people are here today ?
My car is on its last legs .
It &apos;s never that simple .
You aren &apos;t alone anymore .
Tom said that he &apos;ll do that in a couple of days .
She &apos;s happy .
He can swim well .
Tom didn &apos;t even know I was here .
He has bought a new car .
Tom felt nervous .
Why does Tom have to go ?
She called off the party .
What &apos;s Tom doing with that ?
I got something in my eye .
She wanted me to come .
This one is for Tom .
Did you study French yesterday ?
We &apos;re sad .
That won &apos;t change .
Tom is in bed with a cold .
I wanted to go home .
Why wait for Christmas ?
She was about to leave the house .
What would I do with that ?
Does Tom have long hair ?
Why should I be afraid of Tom ?
We &apos;re bored .
I &apos;m feeling kind of tired .
I &apos;m not going to let you go .
Tom wondered where he was supposed to sit .
Tom is our friend .
I have to walk to school .
Mary showed the letter to me .
Tom made a promise .
Did you ever really love me ?
Tom is much taller than Mary .
I was confused .
Do the children go to school ?
Who &apos;s staying ?
You have to speak only English .
I &apos;ll never see her again .
Tom said he thought Mary was in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t get his hands on everything he needed .
I asked Tom some questions .
I think I know him .
We went to Boston last year for the first time .
I &apos;d rather not know .
He called at my house .
Tell me what you think about my car .
I will go out if it is fine tomorrow .
I hope that is not the case .
I think you &apos;re doing that wrong .
All of my friends like Tom .
Tom has been here for three hours .
It &apos;s something Tom made .
I want what &apos;s mine .
Tom thought Mary was stupid .
In any case , we &apos;ll go .
We broke up .
At home , we speak only French .
When did you get home ?
As it is , I can do nothing .
I think I &apos;ll take that one .
I &apos;m very busy these days .
This is my father .
I do think so .
I want your opinion .
Why did you call me ?
Tom can &apos;t get the bottle open . Could you help him ?
I don &apos;t want to talk to him anymore .
Does everybody have a pencil ?
I thought Tom had already gone home .
Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
Are we good to go ?
Tom worked hard all summer .
Tom and I are both very proud of you .
It was the wrong thing to do .
Let me see that .
Tom and Mary often go shopping together .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend .
We were in Boston .
What ? What did you say ?
He was absent from class .
I don &apos;t know what that guy &apos;s name is .
Who is that guy ?
I want to see Boston .
Tom knows why Mary is in Boston .
Bring me the newspaper , please .
We have enough food .
How well do you sing ?
That sounds great .
Tom plays tennis .
Tom could be telling the truth .
That &apos;s not always the case .
There is a bridge across the river .
Tom left yesterday right after you did .
We &apos;ll save this piece of cake for Tom .
What do we know ?
I won &apos;t ever give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is happy or not .
How much money do you have with you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston .
Did you hear Tom is in town ?
It &apos;s very hot in here .
I hate my life .
Tom was late for dinner .
All I want is to be alone for a few months .
My sister is married .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary isn &apos;t coming .
I like Tom a lot , you know .
Tom is too busy to go today .
Come here before seven o &apos;clock .
I need ice .
I can sing .
Did you make it ?
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t talk about that .
We &apos;re a long way from being finished .
We know where your family lives .
I &apos;ve got to go to church tomorrow .
Can &apos;t you speak English ?
You can stay only if you &apos;re quiet .
I was happy to do it , Tom .
This car is used by my father .
We have no more rice .
I am eating .
The cat is waiting for you at home .
You know what I think .
Tom didn &apos;t have much time for studying .
I wish I could speak French as well as you do .
Tom is one person I &apos;ll never forget .
Did you watch this movie ?
I don &apos;t want anyone to see me like this .
Tom knows what we need .
I &apos;ll be back right away .
We don &apos;t need to hurry .
I hope no one saw you .
I feel better today .
I &apos;ve just seen Tom .
He &apos;s in the hospital .
I don &apos;t know when we &apos;re supposed to be there .
You &apos;re a beautiful girl .
I hear music .
Everybody thinks Tom is a bit crazy .
He did not know what to say .
He asked after you .
I met him by chance .
You need not have come so early .
We both have the same problem .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
Tom has been here for three years .
How long are you planning to stay ?
What a tall boy he is !
His hair has turned white .
I told him everything .
I think it &apos;s great that you &apos;re able to do that .
It &apos;s dark .
What do you think of all this ?
Do you think Tom is going to agree to this ?
Where does it hurt ?
May I sit next to you ?
I hate to tell you this , but Tom doesn &apos;t really like you .
Tom is a very good man .
Is now a good time to talk to Tom ?
I prefer cats to dogs .
I don &apos;t need them .
As is often the case with her , she didn &apos;t show up on time .
I don &apos;t like Boston that much .
Tom was there with his girlfriend .
Tom will visit Mary in Australia next month .
I have no friends to help me .
Tom is the one who needs to do this .
I never thought I &apos;d win .
What does this sentence mean ?
It made me very rich .
I &apos;m not mad at you .
How long does this train stop there ?
Do you think she still loves me ?
The girl wanted to tell him the truth , but she couldn &apos;t .
Who can solve the problem ?
I wish we had done that .
Tom still thinks I &apos;m working for Mary .
He broke his word .
What &apos;ll you give Tom ?
I guess Tom forgot to tell you .
Tom has a sister who likes to play tennis .
I know where to look for Tom .
I watch television every day .
Why did Tom want to learn French ?
My window was open .
Tom stood on his head .
Tom is going to love you guys .
I think Tom will be interested .
Do you really think that could happen ?
Tom is my enemy .
Is she married ?
People should love one another .
Tom isn &apos;t a doctor .
Don &apos;t ask me to do that .
I guess I &apos;d better go .
Your mother will be back before long .
How does it look ?
He believes every word I say .
I love my home .
She is able to speak ten languages .
There are no cars on the street .
Mary is almost as pretty as you .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t help each other .
Tom wanted to buy a new car .
I don &apos;t like what you said about Tom .
Is it far from here ?
We &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
That will pass .
I have to take my son to the doctor .
Tom and Mary grew up together .
I can &apos;t remember ever being so scared .
I did what I could .
Tom needed this .
We &apos;ve only got one chance .
Have you thought of that ?
This isn &apos;t just for me .
A book came for you in the mail today .
I think I know where Tom is .
There are too many rules .
Come soon .
It &apos;s no use asking me for money .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t have any children .
I &apos;m going to the park .
My house is near the church .
Tom doesn &apos;t see it like that .
I don &apos;t have it with me .
Take the children inside .
Tom was confused .
I &apos;m sure Tom will tell Mary .
Tom left Australia three months ago .
How is it going with you and Tom ?
You &apos;re not satisfied , are you ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem all that surprised .
We have our lives to live .
I &apos;m sure Tom would want you to do that .
It &apos;s been three years since they got married .
Tom &apos;s father never came back home before nine or ten .
Why do you think Tom is here ?
There is not much difference between the two .
Have you ever played with Tom &apos;s dog ?
I don &apos;t want to live like that .
Tom needs it .
My sister didn &apos;t help me .
I was too small .
I just need to ask Tom some questions .
Tom wrote two books .
I could have done better if I had had more time .
You already know the truth .
I &apos;m here with my family .
Tom wants to know what &apos;s going on .
I wanted to marry him .
He is no longer a boy .
They &apos;re there .
I &apos;m getting hungry again .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come see me .
He came back from America .
This book has many pictures .
I &apos;m sure that my daughter will pass the exam .
Something &apos;s not right .
The boy was tired .
I look forward to it .
Tom is not good enough .
Tom is watching .
Where is my brother ?
It could happen to anyone .
Tom won &apos;t have this job much longer .
The picture was wonderful . You ought to have seen it .
Is he correct ?
I don &apos;t think Tom is doing that .
Tom has a son .
He set off to Paris .
He &apos;s definitely not coming .
Tom can dance quite well .
I can &apos;t do this without you , Tom .
Did you hear about Tom and Mary ?
He made up his mind quickly .
Give that to him .
Tom and I are going to be fine .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to go .
I &apos;m impressed .
The woman is beautiful .
Tom sat next to Mary at the piano .
I think you &apos;ve done enough .
I have good news for you , Tom .
How many eggs could you get yesterday ?
Does he have any brothers ?
I would like to show you my beautiful city .
Tom said that it probably wouldn &apos;t take too much time .
What made you ask Tom that ?
Tom wondered how tall Mary was .
I want to know where you &apos;re going .
They &apos;ll come looking for you .
It takes three hours to get to Boston from here .
We were surprised how fast the police were there .
There are no rules .
We &apos;re going alone .
You should do that right now .
You shouldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
Have you seen this man ?
What happened there ?
You are a bit fat .
She likes wine .
Tom showed us a picture of Mary .
These keys are Tom &apos;s .
My father will come home at seven .
Tom isn &apos;t very tall .
Tom probably took it .
We had nothing to talk about .
I &apos;d rather be poor than rich .
I think Tom may want to do that .
Can you stand ?
She talked about her family .
I would never lend Tom any money .
Tom wants to work in a hospital .
Why &apos;s Tom like that ?
We have a little time before the next train .
Why don &apos;t you just forget it ?
Tom isn &apos;t happy about this .
I made him open the door .
You &apos;re always around .
I &apos;ll come as often as possible .
Everyone has to start somewhere .
How long have you been here ?
There are just two of us .
I did that while Tom was sleeping .
How often do you go swimming ?
Tom can hardly walk .
His whole family is like that .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
What was Tom wearing when he died ?
Tom didn &apos;t give us any money .
What &apos;s Tom going to do ?
I only wanted to talk to Tom .
Let &apos;s just have some fun .
Tom didn &apos;t even notice me .
I know that Tom is married .
When did you begin to learn English ?
Tom will probably come .
Tom slept on the sofa .
Does every boy have to learn cooking in your school ?
Don &apos;t you give up on me .
You don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom has come a long way .
It was hard for Tom to get his homework done on time .
We &apos;ll miss Tom a lot .
I can &apos;t believe I actually wanted to marry you .
Tom was kind enough to lend me the money I needed .
Tom couldn &apos;t save Mary .
Can you tell me the way to the station ?
You have no one to blame but yourself .
I &apos;ve decided that I shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
When did you last hear from Tom ?
What don &apos;t you like about your job ?
Tom will drive you to the airport .
I usually walk to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he is .
Tom drove me to the airport .
Tom isn &apos;t happy .
Would you do me a favor ?
Tom and Mary became good friends .
Tom thinks it &apos;s great .
Tom will be along soon .
I don &apos;t want to dance .
I told her what to do .
Tom knows what &apos;s wrong .
The rain stopped and the sun came out .
Tom has changed his name .
I didn &apos;t make it very far .
I wouldn &apos;t care if Tom did that .
Let &apos;s go home , Tom .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want you here ?
Tom makes more money than his parents .
What is he like ?
Tom is the person who hit Mary .
Tom has never been to Boston .
I can &apos;t say that .
I &apos;m not sorry that I did this .
We can &apos;t do this without you .
Most students study hard .
A day without you is like a summer without the sun .
I &apos;m sure Tom will like the gift you got him .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I can &apos;t remember how to do it .
There is no use crying for help . No one will hear you .
I slept for nine hours .
You &apos;ve been making too many mistakes .
I think Tom is old .
Where are our children ?
Is that from a book ?
Tom runs as fast as you .
You ought to know .
How was the weather yesterday ?
Who &apos;ll take care of your cat then ?
I &apos;ll play with you .
Give me something to eat .
My mother can &apos;t drive a car .
Tom said he had a gift for Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t going to have to do that by himself .
I know that I &apos;m not perfect .
Can you explain that ?
I sent it to you two days ago .
What made her do that ?
Who is that ?
Tom needs to help Mary more than he does .
The student raised his hand .
My sister has a job .
Why doesn &apos;t she love me anymore ?
Everyone is looking forward to watching the game .
How many hours a day do you study French ?
My mother didn &apos;t see the boy on the street .
It &apos;s not possible .
These things take time .
I &apos;m ready to go .
It &apos;s a beautiful day , isn &apos;t it ?
I can &apos;t go back there now .
That actually happened .
I have no time to write to her .
You can &apos;t both be right .
Tom is now ready to talk .
I think about her often .
The station is a ten minute drive from here .
Tom has been waiting a long time .
I have to have that .
We must change our plan .
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog .
Maybe Tom likes you , too .
She said that I should come home soon .
We won &apos;t tell anyone .
Tom said he &apos;s always been interested in music .
How many people work here ?
Tom is very happy here .
Everyone &apos;s reading .
You have taught him well .
This isn &apos;t my bag .
It &apos;s cold here .
I don &apos;t have time right now .
Why don &apos;t you come along with us to the party ?
Where do you go to church ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
Nobody could believe it .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary can .
Tom and Mary are with me .
I wish somebody would help me with that .
Is he tall ?
Isn &apos;t that what you said ?
This room is just about big enough .
If you &apos;d just asked me , I would &apos;ve done it .
Let me see what &apos;s in your hand .
We &apos;ve come home .
Tom bought Mary a small gift .
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
The tree was ready to fall down .
What &apos;s good ?
I don &apos;t ever go there anymore .
These glasses aren &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
Can you open it ?
Tom seems to like speaking French .
I went swimming in the river .
This was the right choice .
He didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Did you enjoy that ?
I don &apos;t have to study French .
I &apos;ll take any job you can offer me .
What do you want for breakfast ?
I knew Tom would like it here .
I forgot it .
She never thinks about him .
He left after me .
I don &apos;t understand this question at all .
She looked around the room .
I don &apos;t want to look at Tom .
Tom bought a table .
That was well worth the trouble .
I have no idea who she is .
The boy has no food .
Let &apos;s try once again .
Tom didn &apos;t like not having enough money .
I don &apos;t want to hear a thing about it .
You have to get him to help you .
He can do it better than me .
I only have one thing left to do .
Tom is going to love it .
I thought it was a bottle .
That sounds like Tom .
There is a little water in the bottle .
I &apos;m quite hungry .
I &apos;ll miss you .
I wonder what they have in common .
Tom asked Mary why she was buying so much food .
Tom won &apos;t be here next month .
That &apos;s what I saw .
You &apos;re just a boy .
I don &apos;t like my job .
Don &apos;t forget about me .
I &apos;d like to live in Australia .
Do you know anybody in Boston ?
Where do you eat lunch ?
Did Tom ask you any questions ?
That won &apos;t make any difference .
No one will be at home .
They got to be good friends .
Nobody can know everything .
Do you have brothers and sisters ?
I live in the house .
I got up while it was still dark .
They are leaving Japan tomorrow .
What happened to my car ?
He may be able to come tomorrow .
Did Tom really kill himself ?
I like meat better than fish .
Are you a doctor ?
She got married to him .
It was three days ago .
Is she your mom ?
I thought Tom was still in jail .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
You should marry Tom .
I want you to do that with Tom .
Can you make it on time ?
Tom came to see me .
I wonder whether or not Tom is nervous .
I &apos;ve changed .
Tom isn &apos;t so tall .
You &apos;ve got no right to talk to Tom that way .
He &apos;s not a good person .
I will never see him again .
Tom ran into the room .
It &apos;s a joke .
Why are you here , Tom ?
We don &apos;t know what to do .
Where could the cat be ?
I &apos;ll see you a week from today .
My father bought me a camera for my birthday .
If I were you , I would trust her .
What &apos;s your older sister &apos;s name ?
I waited for Tom all afternoon , but he didn &apos;t show up .
Is it good ?
I believe that she is honest .
I &apos;m not as old as Tom thinks I am .
These aren &apos;t yours , are they ?
I spent the whole day reading a novel .
Do you want to see my room ?
Tom appears to know Mary .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you dance .
Don &apos;t take everything so seriously .
When will you come back to school ?
I made a decision .
What I &apos;m telling you is true .
How long has it been since we last met ?
What is that big new building ?
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone .
Tom would be very disappointed if Mary didn &apos;t do that .
I just want a little more coffee .
This is for Tom .
What &apos;s eating her ?
Tom can no longer live here .
I remember it as if it were yesterday .
The room is hot .
I thought he was sick .
Where should Tom go ?
He cannot stop us .
Who &apos;ll succeed ?
If it were not for water , we couldn &apos;t live .
She just told me .
They have come .
They were satisfied .
Come see me again .
I took a lot of pictures in Australia .
Why is it that you are always late ?
Tom noticed that Mary seemed to be mad at John .
Tom really needs your help .
I &apos;ll take this one .
I didn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom &apos;s father &apos;s name is John .
You &apos;re nervous .
I know how to play soccer .
It &apos;s not going to end well .
I think Tom knows what to do .
She watched the children going back to school .
Tom will always love you .
They are talking about this and that .
Take me home .
I &apos;ve never seen anyone like you .
Tom said that he &apos;d be able to help us do that tomorrow afternoon .
I just don &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s serious .
Tom and Mary are getting married on Monday .
Can we afford it ?
Tom has been expecting Mary .
People like to talk .
Tom was the only one who didn &apos;t laugh at Mary &apos;s joke .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so angry .
I will get in touch with you next week .
I &apos;m just not very hungry .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice wasn &apos;t cute .
I need French for my job .
Where are we going , Tom ?
She went off with her friends .
The map is on the wall .
Which is better ?
He cannot play guitar .
I told you to stop calling me that .
He used to love her .
What time &apos;s the meeting ?
Whose food is this ?
If I can do it , so can you .
Are you sure you don &apos;t know Tom ?
This book is meant for children .
What are you doing tonight ?
I don &apos;t feed my dog in the morning .
Don &apos;t go away .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let me leave .
May I go ?
Just because he &apos;s rich , doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s happy .
The only one here who can do that is Tom .
Why is Tom shy ?
I &apos;m going to go find a doctor .
That &apos;s hard to believe .
It was an easy decision .
I can &apos;t decide what to eat for lunch today .
You can &apos;t lose .
Nobody knows my country .
She plays tennis after school every day .
Tom is very calm .
We should get married .
I &apos;ve been here for three hours .
If I had enough money , I would buy the book .
It was in this box .
Take me to your place .
I hope you &apos;re not talking about me .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t go there alone .
Tom is trying to understand .
I remember giving him the key .
They &apos;re with me .
They &apos;re right behind me .
Do you really want to know what I think ?
Tom went for a doctor .
I &apos;ve visited Boston before .
When it &apos;s this hot , I don &apos;t feel like doing anything .
I think Tom is correct .
I had never seen Tom cry .
You know Tom likes Mary .
Tom learned to swim last summer .
Did Tom call you last night ?
I live here alone .
I have money .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it now .
I &apos;m too tired .
Let it be .
Why &apos;s that important ?
Tom had only one leg .
The soup &apos;s cold .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to like this .
He may have said so .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for me .
I think it &apos;s happening again .
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French ?
I can &apos;t say exactly .
That &apos;s the car I &apos;m going to buy .
I &apos;m coming .
Come on , Tom .
It took him three months to learn to ride a bicycle .
We feel bad for them .
Tom left ten minutes ago .
Tom has three brothers .
I wish I could be in Paris now .
Would you mind writing it down on this piece of paper ?
The boy is very honest .
I &apos;m only thinking of you .
That &apos;s the right answer .
Tom needs time .
Tom will be asleep by the time we get there .
There &apos;s nothing here .
It &apos;s impossible to learn English in a month .
This is my mother .
There are more girls than boys in our school .
I just bought a new pair of shoes .
This isn &apos;t for you .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car yet .
Tom and Mary look good together .
I talked about music .
I don &apos;t need a reason .
We are his children .
It &apos;s enough for five days .
I &apos;m leaving .
Can I have the paper when you &apos;re finished with it ?
I know Tom was right .
If you know what &apos;s good for you , you &apos;ll quit doing that .
It is impossible for me to do so .
Tom didn &apos;t ask what the rules were .
It isn &apos;t easy .
I &apos;ve met that girl before .
Tom &apos;s wearing a new coat .
Tom likes to look at pictures of cats .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s doing .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
I don &apos;t know how Tom knows .
The bill &apos;s correct , thank you .
Tom said he had been busy .
Would you like milk and sugar ?
Tom likes music .
Tom is probably not very hungry right now .
Tom is very sure that Mary did that .
The girl seems to be rich .
It &apos;s almost six o &apos;clock .
We want to have a large family .
No one will ever find you .
I don &apos;t think she can speak French .
The bank doesn &apos;t open for another hour .
I &apos;m a college student .
We &apos;re really good .
Did you invite Tom to dinner without telling me ?
We had nothing in common .
Tom wanted his money back .
We don &apos;t like you .
Tom looked calm .
Tom is giving up .
They are the same age .
My hotel told me to call you .
They often make fun of the boss .
Where is that ?
Tom arrived ten minutes ago , but I haven &apos;t seen him yet .
They don &apos;t have a car .
I &apos;m very glad I got to know you .
You &apos;re really tall , aren &apos;t you ?
I get paid tomorrow .
Why don &apos;t you just let Tom help ?
The boys were injured .
I don &apos;t feel so good .
I can do that in less than ten minutes .
There are still people who don &apos;t know how to read .
Did Tom get a chance ?
I took the money .
What &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
Why don &apos;t you give Tom a chance ?
Tom wants to marry Mary .
I wish I had married her .
We can begin .
I understand it .
Tom &apos;s business is doing very well .
I gave my sister a dictionary .
Don &apos;t make me do this .
I caught more fish than Tom did .
My grandfather is very healthy .
I hope it &apos;s not true .
Where &apos;s your family , Tom ?
I still have a lot to learn .
I like this one .
Is the baby able to walk ?
Tom did really well .
I &apos;ll never help you .
I know that I &apos;m right .
The person who taught me how to do that is Tom .
That &apos;s not up to you .
It isn &apos;t funny anymore .
You have the right to the truth .
Whose idea was it ?
Tom had only three dollars with him .
There &apos;s no need to get so angry .
That &apos;s mine , too .
I like your coffee .
We have nothing else .
What does that mean ?
Tom loves that .
She has a lot of money .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether to laugh or cry .
I want to see you in my office .
He runs very fast .
I brought you some ice .
We really did try .
Would you care for a cup of tea ?
Tom is here , isn &apos;t he ?
You &apos;re dangerous .
I &apos;m looking forward to getting your letter .
Tom bought a shirt yesterday .
He can do it well , and you can do it even better .
I thought it would be best if you told Tom yourself .
That boy showed no fear .
He lives with his mom .
Tom is coming for you .
The train left the station on time .
Something has happened .
How long does it take to get there from here ?
I &apos;m much younger than you .
What &apos;s mine is yours .
How could Tom know that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to know .
He didn &apos;t believe it at first .
I know you can make it .
Tom lived in Australia last year .
That &apos;s a joke .
I don &apos;t want to be seen with him .
I wish there was more I could &apos;ve done .
We can talk about this later .
Tom is on vacation .
That &apos;ll change nothing .
He plays tennis very well .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t early .
We have to leave in five minutes .
I really wish I could play tennis with you tomorrow .
Don &apos;t try this at home .
Tom seems to be rich now .
Tom isn &apos;t getting one .
Tom didn &apos;t get up before six .
I thought I was going crazy .
Aren &apos;t you Tom ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know anyone in Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any plans for tomorrow .
Everyone seems to be busy but me .
The radio is on .
Do you want to try ?
I made him go .
How long &apos;s Tom been gone ?
Mary told me that she was glad to see me .
You have one hour .
I don &apos;t believe I caught your name .
Would you like go out for a drink after work ?
I &apos;ll go on Sunday .
You must do as you are told to do .
You don &apos;t have to apologize , Tom .
She looks like a teacher .
I &apos;ve got two brothers and a sister .
I came by car .
I live in Japan .
I got into bed and immediately fell asleep .
That house is big .
When do you think Tom is going to do that ?
You can eat whatever you like .
Something like this can happen to anyone .
How did you get so good at French ?
It had started to rain .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me before ?
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children .
Tom wants a large family .
I want to go to the movies today .
I know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom is in the room .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to not have enough to eat .
What does Tom look like ?
No one knows what &apos;s really going on .
I asked Tom to spend the weekend with us .
It &apos;s better that way .
I &apos;m thinking of going abroad .
I would appreciate your help .
He often plays the guitar .
It was far from certain .
Tom says that he was born in Boston .
Tom looked as if he hadn &apos;t eaten for days .
Could you please wait until I &apos;m finished ?
He has another son .
I &apos;ve just read this book .
Tom stopped talking and began to eat .
Tom wrote to Mary .
He wants to get a new dictionary .
She is not my sister but my mother .
How lucky you are !
Tom has a little money .
What is the doctor doing ?
It &apos;s only four minutes from here by train .
What would the world do without tea ?
Tom and Mary are innocent .
I think I might be able to speak French better than Tom .
Do I really have to drink that ?
Tom and Mary see eye to eye on this .
I &apos;m happy the game is over .
How tall is he ?
Tom gave a speech .
Tom doesn &apos;t make many mistakes .
You must come with me .
I would &apos;ve loved to meet Tom .
Since it &apos;s important , I &apos;ll attend to it .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
Tom talks in his sleep .
Here is my key .
Could you pass me the salt , please ?
I haven &apos;t gotten around to doing that yet .
Do you want some company ?
That is the shop where I used to work .
She doesn &apos;t have any children , does she ?
We are to meet again at the park tomorrow afternoon .
You want it , don &apos;t you ?
I make lunch every day .
You have only to ask for it .
Did you just say something to me ?
Don &apos;t let Tom drink beer .
Tom is sometimes absent from school .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what kind of person Mary is .
Nothing was working .
These are our books .
I think we &apos;re safe now .
We have enough water .
I &apos;m sure Tom is OK .
How about going for a walk after lunch ?
I think Tom likes to do that .
Tom needs the money .
Did you go to school yesterday ?
I don &apos;t feel like taking a walk now .
So where are you guys going ?
I would &apos;ve waited .
I &apos;m going shopping tomorrow .
Tom got nervous .
I &apos;m not very good at this .
Tom put the map on the table .
Why are you talking like that ?
She met him three years ago .
What is it with you and Tom ?
Let &apos;s meet on Monday .
You have made it .
Tom told me he isn &apos;t going to do that .
I need someone I can trust .
I &apos;m not afraid any more .
Isn &apos;t this what you want ?
Tom has never been late for school .
I didn &apos;t think anyone still lived in this house .
We should call Tom .
I just want you to know that Tom is safe .
We &apos;ve got another three days .
You won &apos;t believe what happened .
I had nothing else to do .
Tom seemed tired .
Is Tom still around ?
Tom , I &apos;m doing this for you .
I don &apos;t need a suitcase that big .
There are almost no books .
Tom didn &apos;t expect to hear back from Mary so soon .
We &apos;re not finished .
That &apos;s life .
I loved that .
Take Tom out of here .
He &apos;s not supposed to be here .
Why is Tom here anyway ?
You &apos;ve got to let me go .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy to me .
Tom wants more coffee .
I don &apos;t know how I can help you .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long .
Do you want to know why ?
I think we &apos;re out of danger .
Would you explain it again ?
How come you ask ?
What made you think Tom hasn &apos;t done that ?
We are not going on vacation .
Tom needs something .
Is Tom in the garden ?
Yesterday , Tom told me he didn &apos;t know how to swim .
I really am sorry .
Has prison changed them ?
I want to talk to him .
Tom always eats breakfast here .
I can &apos;t start up my computer . What am I supposed to do ?
Do you want to sit next to the window ?
He &apos;s not sick .
No one left .
You &apos;re going to get us all in trouble .
Can we have a moment alone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t remember anything .
Tom and Mary went outside .
I &apos;ll call you up tomorrow morning .
Was the movie interesting ?
I &apos;m working in Boston .
Which of you did it ?
She does nothing but cry .
That is not true .
I wish Tom were dead .
I &apos;ll take Tom .
I think Tom can help you .
I &apos;m very poor .
Why are we still here ?
I can &apos;t remember how I got here .
Tom never was very good at baseball .
Tom used to be really famous .
What makes you say that ?
If you want to be a good father , you need to spend time with your children .
Tom had no water to drink .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will say .
Tom never talks to Mary anymore .
Why did Tom ask Mary to do that ?
It was cold outside .
He sat on the bench .
Tom doesn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
We &apos;re looking for Tom .
I &apos;m about to go out .
Tom was laughing .
You &apos;ll be great .
If you really want to know , all you have to do is ask .
Is this your beer ?
He can be proud of his father .
How old were you when you fell in love for the first time ?
What happened to my bag ?
Nobody tried to help Tom .
Why does this surprise you ?
I &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d help me .
He isn &apos;t afraid of death .
The child is going on seven .
Tom was really drunk .
Has anybody come ?
We &apos;re scared it &apos;ll happen again .
Tom is kind of famous , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll help you .
The movie isn &apos;t as good as the book .
I don &apos;t like you , Tom .
I really can &apos;t understand it .
She should know better at her age .
I thought Tom died last year in Boston .
Look what happened .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom dance .
I believe that it can be done .
Everyone &apos;s saying it .
&quot; Where is my phone ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on my desk . &quot;
Do you know what &apos;s become of Tom ?
It &apos;s popular in China .
We &apos;re doing what we love to do .
I &apos;ll have a cup of coffee .
I just work here .
Tom passed away yesterday afternoon .
I came to thank you .
Why do you care about this ?
I &apos;m coming in October .
What else did you two do ?
Let &apos;s eat our food before it gets cold .
Tom won &apos;t likely feel like doing that .
Tom held one of Mary &apos;s hands , and John held the other .
I &apos;m studying very hard .
Nobody knows me in Boston .
It &apos;s not likely Tom did that on purpose .
I said I didn &apos;t remember .
You really know your stuff .
When are you coming to see me ?
Don &apos;t you like that ?
This isn &apos;t news to anyone .
I may not do that .
I &apos;m in a bad mood today .
We &apos;re almost home .
Can you tell me who they are ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
Tom couldn &apos;t forget Mary even if he wanted to .
What should I buy ?
I used to stay up late .
She is used to sitting .
I have something in my eye .
Tom wanted Mary .
She has more books .
Tom must &apos;ve been lying .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
We don &apos;t know where we &apos;ll live next year .
My brother is healthy .
Tom became very ill .
I have to get to Tom .
Are you , by any chance , scared of me ?
I want to become a doctor .
Tom slept .
Tom likes you .
I ate an apple before I went for a walk .
We really appreciate it .
I would rather not go shopping alone .
She didn &apos;t seem interested .
I &apos;m going to be there .
You shouldn &apos;t have told him such a thing .
Tom is driving .
Tom makes Mary happy .
What do you want to eat this weekend ?
I &apos;m doing great .
Did Tom give you something for me ?
Tom isn &apos;t at the hotel .
How many apples are there ?
Tom took his daughter to school .
Tom asked Mary if she spoke more than three languages .
My father isn &apos;t home .
Is there a restaurant close by ?
She invited us to her birthday party .
There isn &apos;t any milk in the glass .
He is the only person for the job .
I saw Tom play tennis .
I know you were in Boston last summer .
I knew you &apos;d want to be told .
What &apos;re you going to do about it ?
Is Tom in trouble ?
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow .
Is there any sugar ?
Do you want to go with Tom ?
They sell sugar at the store .
Please tell me this isn &apos;t true .
Tom didn &apos;t want to sit next to Mary .
Why are you looking so sad ?
Tom is watching the news on TV .
Why are you with me ?
Tom came with me .
Where &apos;s your car , Tom ?
He died a few hours later .
You know Tom , I think .
I didn &apos;t ask questions .
Everyone is singing .
Do you know where Tom was born ?
How often does it rain in Boston ?
My mother was in the hospital during the summer .
I don &apos;t drink that much beer .
Tom could do that .
You were late for work .
We didn &apos;t have school today .
I &apos;ll never work for you .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll make it .
Tom hardly ever speaks to me anymore .
I know you have it .
Can I see you in my office for a minute ?
He seems tired .
Tom knew the truth , but he didn &apos;t let anyone know that he knew it .
What did you expect ?
It was a mistake to break up with you .
It wasn &apos;t hard .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what to do .
Tom called Mary to tell her he &apos;d be late .
I &apos;m not rich .
I &apos;ll go .
I like him .
I went into Tom &apos;s room .
I &apos;ll do it if they pay me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary likes him or not .
I &apos;ve lost my pencil .
It was cold yesterday .
Tom promised to come home early tonight .
Tom likes animals .
Why don &apos;t we head back ?
I &apos;m very popular .
I &apos;d like some ice cream .
I have the right to say what I think .
I couldn &apos;t stand it .
Why do you want to be alone all the time ?
Tom and Mary have everything they need .
I &apos;ve never felt so happy in my life .
Where does Tom live ?
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Tom is already there .
I just found them .
They seem busy .
Tom spoke in French at the meeting .
I don &apos;t know if this is such a good idea .
How can I just tell Tom without telling everybody else ?
I didn &apos;t kill anyone .
I saw her yesterday .
You didn &apos;t let me finish my sentence .
We &apos;ve got to find the key .
Tom is the one I saw .
I was in the library .
My mother was sick for two days .
I &apos;ve already tried .
I can only speak English .
I think you &apos;re going to do great .
My bike has been stolen .
Tom made Mary go .
You &apos;ve got to do it now .
I won &apos;t be here next month .
Tom knows I like him .
They saw nothing .
He plays tennis three times a week .
I bought a watch .
It is used by a great many people .
I &apos;m by no means angry with you .
We are from France .
You ask questions about everything .
It makes me so angry .
He can hardly walk .
This book is written in French .
I don &apos;t read as many books as I used to .
It makes sense .
It turned out all for the best .
I &apos;ve got to finish this .
I can &apos;t move my leg .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t feel like doing that today .
We &apos;ve changed that .
I hate people like you .
We are in Paris .
Where can we meet you ?
Why are you busy today ?
Why do they come here ?
You aren &apos;t happy , are you ?
I don &apos;t want you to go to Boston .
Tom asked me if I had found the keys .
Why didn &apos;t you come yesterday ? I waited a long time for you .
I asked the same question to Tom that I asked Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to work by himself .
I have nothing left to lose .
Why don &apos;t you leave him alone ?
I lost sight of my friends .
How do you come to school ?
I used to ride my bike to school , but now I take the bus .
We want Tom to help us tomorrow evening .
This question is difficult to answer .
He &apos;s somewhere in the park .
Tom realized that he wasn &apos;t the same as the other kids .
I &apos;ve known that a long time .
Tom and his wife are from Australia .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
We learn French at school .
Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
I never forgot you .
You should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
I &apos;ll love you always .
You &apos;re my woman .
You and Tom are the best friends I &apos;ve ever had .
All we can do is to wait for him .
My father does not eat much fruit .
Perhaps we could talk later .
Did you make this yourself ?
Now I &apos;m ready .
Tom goes to school with my daughter .
Tom didn &apos;t say where or when to meet him .
I &apos;m asking you what you think .
The bus doesn &apos;t always come on time .
I &apos;m the new teacher .
Tom and Mary are looking for John .
I wouldn &apos;t have come here if Tom hadn &apos;t asked me to .
That cake looks good .
Were you in love with Tom ?
Could I have some more coffee ?
Tom seems to agree with us .
I &apos;ll explain the matter to you later on .
Just between us , she &apos;s my girlfriend .
You &apos;d better leave it .
That sounds too good to be true .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here again .
Tom is just a friend .
Tom and Mary both failed the exam .
Tom wasn &apos;t that stupid .
I don &apos;t like the coffee .
It was for Tom .
They went hand in hand .
He is likely to come .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got to go .
He had to stay in hospital for a whole week .
The girls were quite impressed .
Tom works for a small company .
Let &apos;s ask the teacher .
I would love to go .
I am of the opinion that she is right .
What made you think Tom did that ?
I am short of money .
What &apos;re they doing ?
I like listening to good music .
You know Tom likes cars .
This book is not sold here .
We can solve this problem easily .
What is it that you &apos;re afraid of ?
We don &apos;t know Tom .
Tom died a few weeks ago .
I don &apos;t know that much about you .
I want a chair .
Tom gave me a key .
I tried to keep from crying .
I &apos;m a little bit tired .
Tom looks drunk .
Some people were late .
He is at work now , but will be coming home at seven .
I will do my best in everything .
They don &apos;t understand French .
It was a joke .
Are you happy where you are ?
There &apos;s no room for us to sit down .
Tom gave away all his money .
Tom and Mary are both happy .
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s wrong .
Tom won &apos;t tell me exactly why he was late .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
Tom and Mary already know each other .
Which house is his ?
I love reading .
Tom speaks French as well as anybody else in this room .
We must phone the police .
Has Tom finished eating ?
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
You always take things too seriously .
There is a chance that he will pass the exam .
Is that true , Tom ?
Have you ever been to Boston before ?
What are you going to do next Sunday ?
You can &apos;t blame him for the accident .
I &apos;ll have to take a look .
I also like apples .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t busy .
I want to see you laugh .
Don &apos;t talk like that .
Tom knows who killed his dog , but he won &apos;t tell us .
Tom wrote down what Mary said .
In the evening , I walk with my dog .
He has been playing tennis since this morning .
They got married three months ago .
Tom and Mary are right behind John .
I &apos;m a good person .
You &apos;re after me .
I thought of Tom right away .
I said I &apos;d look after you .
That &apos;s against the law .
He is too drunk to drive home .
Tom sat down on the sofa .
I &apos;m getting good at it .
When was the last time you went on a date ?
This is for you , I think .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to help Mary .
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was .
I think it &apos;s going to be fun .
I thought you might need it .
You don &apos;t work here .
It cannot last long .
Why don &apos;t you go to school ?
How long is that bridge ?
They won &apos;t hurt you .
I thought that you had already eaten .
Tom is missing .
Who stayed ?
He asked for more money .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t love him .
She talks a lot .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary play with the other children .
Tom kept his promise to Mary .
Why didn &apos;t you go with Tom ?
We &apos;re not totally ready yet .
Please tell me which bus to take to get to the station .
I don &apos;t want to play with you .
Tom doesn &apos;t usually do things like that .
Tom promised not to tell Mary anything .
They &apos;re about to leave .
You aren &apos;t invited .
I &apos;m not good at it .
It should be possible to change that .
Mary , I love you .
Tom didn &apos;t know what I was trying to do .
Do I have to bring my son to your office ?
We know all about you .
We &apos;ve seen him .
Tom is extremely kind .
I hear from her once in a while .
Whose tea is this ?
She &apos;s afraid of getting sick again .
My birthday is coming soon .
We like playing soccer .
They have lost a lot .
Tom put some flowers on the table .
I thought I could be of some help .
Tom wrote to his parents .
This is too good to be true .
Tom is back .
What &apos;s going on up there ?
Tom was not much older than Mary .
Tom always thinks about others .
Tom left the room .
If Tom goes , I &apos;ll go , too .
Did you let Tom kiss you ?
Go and have a look .
How long have you known him ?
He could speak French .
I give my word .
We can pay .
I have never felt better .
I think that I won &apos;t do that .
A person like Tom probably knows how to swim .
You do that faster than Tom .
Let &apos;s play baseball .
Tom slept in the car .
It &apos;s important to read a lot of books .
We &apos;ve been talking about you .
That won &apos;t work !
Do you want to take a break ?
That was a new experience for me .
Tom died with a knife in his back .
I don &apos;t feel safe here .
Where did you get this beautiful dress ?
Tom &apos;s hands are small .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe that Mary had actually kissed him .
She asked us to be quiet .
You really are strong .
Who would be stupid enough to do that ?
I &apos;ll miss you , Tom .
Where do you use it ?
I like this .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you .
I don &apos;t know the way .
How do you feel about it ?
Is there something that you want to tell me ?
Tom said that it might be true .
I forgot my pencil .
I &apos;ll get another job .
I &apos;m going to buy a camera for my daughter .
We arrived at the station at five .
What time do you usually eat lunch ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Tom fell down and wasn &apos;t able to get up .
Why haven &apos;t I seen you here before ?
Do you have children ?
Don &apos;t you know the truth ?
Tom is paid to do that .
I couldn &apos;t help myself .
I don &apos;t know why Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
It looks good on paper .
I should go to bed .
Give me the watch .
He took off his glasses .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak French .
Why aren &apos;t you here ?
She &apos;s two years younger than him .
Tom loves Mary , but she doesn &apos;t love him .
Tom , are you awake ?
Would you be so kind as to open the door for me ?
That makes no difference .
She &apos;s innocent .
Tom got to his feet and walked over to the window .
I &apos;ll ask Tom .
Are you going to miss it ?
I can speak to Tom .
I &apos;m going with Tom .
I work in a bank .
Tom says he drinks to forget .
I just don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible .
No one knows her name .
Can you help me find my keys ?
I still haven &apos;t heard from him .
Tom wanted to have another baby , but his wife didn &apos;t .
He was not happy at all .
She went from London to Paris .
Tom is right .
I &apos;ve been doing it for years .
The teacher made fun of Tom .
It &apos;s very big .
Do you already have a plan ?
Tom died a few days ago .
He failed to take the exam .
It is clear that he is rich .
Tom said he would write to us .
The baby opened his mouth .
I don &apos;t know how to say that in French .
Do you believe in love at first sight ?
You &apos;re right , I think .
Can you sing this song ?
She went shopping .
We know that .
Why don &apos;t you like me ?
This car is mine .
I &apos;ll never ever do that again .
How many times have you been there ?
You should come with us .
They are expected any minute now .
It &apos;s warm today , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom slept an hour .
Where &apos;s my food ?
Tom invited Mary and her sister to his party .
Tom did badly at school .
They like apples .
That is our school .
Tom likes watching TV .
We expect that it will rain today .
It &apos;s very likely that it &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
She advised him not to eat too much .
Tom has a gun .
Tom and Mary have been studying French together all afternoon .
You &apos;re not welcome here anymore .
Tom spent three weeks in the hospital .
Tom drove himself to the hospital .
Did Tom really do that ?
Be nice .
I asked Tom why he wanted to go to Boston .
We can &apos;t afford this .
That &apos;s exactly what you need now .
I want to eat something that isn &apos;t sweet .
I might be a few minutes late .
I wish I had a friend like you .
I &apos;m doing my best .
Tom is satisfied .
He would often come to see me .
How are you today ?
His house is near a river .
I wish she had come last night .
I &apos;d just like to know if you are coming or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to apologize . He did nothing wrong .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
Tom spoke French .
Why do I always have to do that ?
I &apos;m not scared at all .
Tom played soccer yesterday .
You &apos;re one of them , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom was in his office all morning .
I &apos;m not going to do this .
Tom can &apos;t write very well .
Who is younger , him or me ?
This is the house that he lives in .
Tom can &apos;t help the way he is .
Tom knew that he was supposed to be doing something else .
Tom tried to stay awake .
I don &apos;t have a lot of work , but it &apos;s enough to keep me in the office this week .
He promised me that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Tom quickly got to work .
Tom gave me a hard time .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to play with his kid .
You should be proud of yourself .
I am studying English now .
Tom married young .
Where do you buy your clothes ?
They are both good students .
I &apos;m interested in getting a hat like this .
Tom looks nervous .
I &apos;d like to stay one more night . Is that possible ?
Tom told his teacher that he had been sick , but that wasn &apos;t true .
Tom says Boston is really cold now .
This room is very cold .
The car ran into a tree .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s ready .
We don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
That restaurant &apos;s too expensive .
We &apos;re a long way from home .
He read this book yesterday .
You have a beautiful voice .
We made him go .
We &apos;re doing fine .
Did someone die ?
Tom knows what you did .
Why was Tom in Boston ?
I don &apos;t care what people say .
She didn &apos;t like living in the city .
Give me that book .
Give that to me .
Tom left a few minutes ago .
What are you going to do next ?
I like that .
We &apos;re not in Boston .
Tom knew that he wasn &apos;t going to be able to convince Mary to go to the dance with him .
Why would someone with Tom &apos;s experience need our help ?
Are you going to help us or not ?
If you want to stay , you may .
No , I &apos;m not a teacher . I &apos;m only a student .
You &apos;ve never been married , have you ?
Tom wants to study French .
Tom couldn &apos;t walk .
Not all of us can speak French .
Tom won &apos;t sing .
Tom doesn &apos;t like those women .
I &apos;m thinking of the plan .
Do you know where Tom works ?
Tom no longer works here .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t understand French well .
Tom always gets up early .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe us .
Why aren &apos;t you coming home ?
I let Tom drive my car .
Was Tom here today ?
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not good enough .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t Canadian ?
I already speak French .
Would you please not do that here ?
We don &apos;t have class today .
Can &apos;t this wait until tomorrow ?
He made her happy .
No one is there .
What are your weekend plans ?
Where are you now ?
Tom and I are with Mary .
I don &apos;t know if Tom works there or not .
Tom will do that .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s seat .
I don &apos;t know which one to choose .
I need this back by tomorrow .
I need to know that Tom is still alive .
Tom won &apos;t come .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
He is a tall boy .
She &apos;s six years older than I am .
Tom looks as young as ever .
Tom wanted to work .
Can someone tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
I don &apos;t even know where Tom is now .
Tom is no longer living in Boston .
Don &apos;t do it ! It &apos;s stupid and dangerous .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did it .
I have a lot in common with him .
Tom wears his hair long .
This &apos;ll help .
I don &apos;t want to fight Tom .
Tom can afford to buy Mary anything she wants .
All are present .
If you know who killed Tom , you should tell the police .
Don &apos;t ever give up hope .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen much of Mary recently .
Tom is not always busy .
I don &apos;t know why Tom and Mary don &apos;t like each other .
This is your hat , isn &apos;t it ?
I think I &apos;d like that .
It doesn &apos;t hurt so much .
That &apos;s easy to say , but it &apos;s not easy to do .
Why don &apos;t you think about it ?
This makes me very angry .
Whose umbrella is this ?
I feel like doing that today .
Who told Tom ?
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was .
The problem is we don &apos;t know where Tom is .
Here is my bicycle .
I didn &apos;t hear her coming .
I found you .
I bought her a new car .
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
I met them .
She plays tennis every day .
Tom is likely going to get out of the hospital tomorrow .
I hope Tom is right .
It &apos;s nice and warm .
We have no water .
I am sorry for you .
I &apos;ve learned to think like Tom thinks .
What should we expect ?
I don &apos;t know much about Boston .
He &apos;s in a good mood today .
That &apos;s exactly what he said .
No one can tell what &apos;ll happen in the future .
It &apos;s your decision .
Tom ran .
Can anyone help me ?
Are you planning to help Tom ?
She must be sick .
I had my car stolen .
You should do your best in everything .
That is the duty of the police .
The baby takes after his mother .
Stop that right now .
I have no idea where Tom hid the money .
Why did you do it , Tom ?
I said nothing .
Tom says he isn &apos;t happy .
Where &apos;s Tom going to be ?
It &apos;s their right .
I wish I was young again .
What time are you coming over tonight ?
I didn &apos;t tell anyone , not even Tom .
It is just a year since I got married .
Tom is speaking .
I believed you .
I have just what you need .
He can read well .
I think this is for you .
All of us plan to do that .
Did you enjoy the concert ?
That &apos;s one way of doing it .
It &apos;s yours if you want it .
It was quite simple .
I have to be here all night .
Tom opened the door and walked in .
He learned to swim .
Tom seems kind .
I feel as if I &apos;ve known Tom for years .
I didn &apos;t sell Tom those .
No one I know likes Tom anymore .
I can &apos;t find anybody to ask .
There is a map on the desk .
What Tom did was very dangerous .
They were my friends .
I want Tom to come with us .
It &apos;s bad for business .
We &apos;ll stay here .
We could go together .
Can you tell me what this word means ?
I don &apos;t know what you want and I don &apos;t care .
May I go to bed ?
She could read when she was four .
This isn &apos;t funny .
Tom and Mary both like to cook .
You don &apos;t have to say that .
Make your bed .
I &apos;d better get back to work .
We saw Tom do it .
Tom came along much later .
Tom did this .
How hot is it ?
I won &apos;t let you out of my sight .
I want to eat something .
Tom has been in Australia for three years .
Why do you want to do that anyway ?
My box is twice as heavy as yours .
I have nothing to say to Tom .
She comes from a good family .
Tom told me Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
What kind of person would do such a thing ?
Get out of the water .
This is my pencil .
I eat a lot .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy .
Tom is making a list .
Tom has got a cold .
He is playing music .
What do you like about me ?
I had my watch stolen yesterday .
I like how you think .
We eat so that we can live .
Are you ready to hear the bad news ?
Tom asked Mary not to leave .
I &apos;m going to need at least five minutes .
Everyone laughed at me yesterday .
Tom wants someone to love him .
I worked a lot today .
I &apos;d ask Tom .
I &apos;m talking .
I didn &apos;t even kiss Tom .
Tom knows we &apos;re here .
Tom and Mary look happy .
We &apos;re not lost .
I have never seen such a thing .
Why does Tom have to do that ?
Tom needs to get some sleep .
Is she coming , too ?
You are no longer a child .
I hope that you won &apos;t make the same mistake as Tom .
She began to talk to the dog .
Just tell the truth .
Tom began to eat his breakfast .
I have things I want to do .
We &apos;d better hurry back .
The kids want some ice cream .
I was in favor of going and they were in favor of staying .
I must get back to my work .
I needed more money .
You should start as early as possible .
This is where I was born .
Tom invited me to a party at his home .
Tom and I didn &apos;t speak to each other for three years .
I &apos;d rather go today than tomorrow .
Tom thinks that Mary may do that .
I don &apos;t know where you are going .
I can only tell you what I know .
You don &apos;t realize how lucky you are .
Tom doesn &apos;t like summer . He says it &apos;s too hot .
No matter how busy you are , you have to do your homework .
Tom returned the keys to Mary .
I &apos;m going to go home .
You &apos;re sick !
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is telling the truth or not .
He speaks quickly .
I &apos;ve never seen him before .
You &apos;re so young .
I feel like I haven &apos;t slept for days .
Tom and Mary were surprised by what they saw .
The box was too heavy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary and John don &apos;t like each other .
Tom was lying in bed watching TV .
We &apos;re innocent .
You &apos;d better call the doctor .
Your hair &apos;s beautiful .
He said that he would come back here tomorrow .
What type of job are you looking for ?
I can &apos;t ever go back there again .
You are free to leave any time you wish .
I am like my father .
Tom was angry with himself .
That &apos;s a very good question . I &apos;m glad you asked it .
You &apos;ll do fine .
I love to read .
Have you called her yet ?
I want to see the movie again .
&quot; I want that book , &quot; he said to himself .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find work in Boston .
You must eat something .
I don &apos;t want to hear this .
Tom went to the hospital because he was sick .
What do you make of it ?
Do you know where your children are ?
It was already dark when Tom got home .
Is there anything that you want to tell me ?
I thought you said you weren &apos;t interested .
Tom picked up one of the pictures .
Tom and Mary sat close to the fire .
He looks his age .
She has a bicycle .
Is there a desk by the window ?
Tom said that he &apos;d come tomorrow .
I wrote a letter to my mother .
Tom thinks this is a mistake .
You &apos;re the best sister in the whole world .
Tom said he loved Mary .
My father bought this house for us when we got married .
Why couldn &apos;t you come yesterday ?
I don &apos;t want to see you here again .
I saw my uncle on the way to school .
I met her on the street by accident .
Tom was satisfied .
I know Tom &apos;s phone number .
What do you think about it ?
I wonder why this is happening .
Thank you for your gift .
They don &apos;t help .
The food is ready .
Tom stayed awake .
I can &apos;t trust what she says .
I &apos;ll be in the kitchen .
This isn &apos;t really true .
I feel like another person .
I &apos;d like three of these .
I &apos;ll never see him again .
The rain turned to snow .
What &apos;s wrong with these people ?
What is the purpose of life ?
Tom didn &apos;t let his children go to Mary &apos;s party .
You and Tom are good friends , right ?
What we &apos;re doing now is very dangerous .
How long did you live on the island ?
I think about that from time to time .
I took off my shoes .
Go back inside .
Tom made it for me .
We didn &apos;t do a thing .
She advised him not to go .
That &apos;s not all Tom said .
He said that he wanted some money .
He has the large room to himself .
I can see why you don &apos;t like Tom .
To tell the truth , we got married last year .
I listen to music .
You &apos;ll be here with me .
What do you think of my new coat ?
I was able to help her .
How can I solve this problem ?
Don &apos;t let the soup get cold .
I thought that was your job .
I &apos;m in love with Mary .
Are there kids ?
His name is Tom and he &apos;s Mary &apos;s brother .
Tom bought himself a new car .
I &apos;ll look after you .
I go to school every morning .
I wonder why Tom did that .
How did they come here ?
Tom is taking care of the kids .
As you like .
I &apos;m still a little hungry .
We take the same bus to work .
Tom would &apos;ve helped us if we &apos;d asked him .
I had nothing to do with that .
Come outside .
Tom said he &apos;s not going to do that .
It &apos;s that simple .
Tom knew that this would happen .
He has not been able to attend school for a week .
It is in the kitchen .
She looked me in the eye .
This is not a hospital .
He promised not to smoke .
I said that quite a long time ago .
Tom gave it a try .
I thought he might come .
It &apos;s raining outside .
He &apos;s only a couple of years older than me .
What &apos;s your daughter &apos;s name ?
She asked him where he lived .
Tom stuck around .
Tom refused to tell me where he lived .
We are who we are .
Why is everything so difficult ?
I like it this way .
I can &apos;t help Tom with his homework .
How old were you when you learned to write your name ?
We &apos;re going out again .
Let me do something else .
I don &apos;t often go to Boston , but every time I do , I enjoy it a lot .
Nobody went there .
Tom never jokes .
Your French has gotten much better .
I &apos;ll be finished doing that by the end of the week .
How do we look ?
She was so angry that she could not speak .
I make the rules .
Tom never spoke to Mary again .
That &apos;s one of our rules .
It &apos;s a big one .
Why doesn &apos;t he tell me jokes anymore ?
Let me know what time you want me there .
Mary was convinced that she would never get married .
We are leaving Japan tomorrow morning .
You don &apos;t want Tom to think you &apos;re stupid .
I &apos;ll phone you as soon as I get to the airport .
There was almost nothing in the room .
He arrived earlier than usual .
Ask your dad to help you .
What did you say yesterday ?
There &apos;s no need to go to school today .
Do you know what &apos;s in here ?
Take this home with you .
I want to know where they &apos;ve taken Tom .
I &apos;ll try again .
Tom didn &apos;t think it was a problem .
I have eyes .
He &apos;s two years older than Mary is .
Has Tom ever been in love ?
We can &apos;t believe anything Tom says about Mary .
Come at two o &apos;clock .
That &apos;s the house where Tom was born .
Tom went to the beach last week .
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary .
There &apos;s a restaurant pretty close to here , but it &apos;s not very good .
I &apos;m worried about Tom .
Tom and Mary went for a walk along the beach .
I have to leave you .
Let &apos;s meet again soon .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Is there somewhere we can talk ?
Did you bring them ?
Look at this one .
Tom has been asking to see you .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to walk .
I &apos;m not good at this .
Tom said that was the first time he &apos;d ever done that .
I don &apos;t have anything to write with .
You have to do this now .
He raised a question .
I know Tom well .
We &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
He has already gone home .
You are everything to me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be with us .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand .
Your dress is very nice .
I &apos;ll help you as much as I can .
Tom doesn &apos;t think you &apos;ll win .
Why did you kiss me ?
The teacher cannot have said such a thing .
Who are these people ?
Do you think you really know me ?
Tom knows Mary knows .
That bridge is very beautiful .
Tom promised Mary he &apos;d do that for her .
Tom told me that he was very tired .
Tom asked me why I couldn &apos;t go .
Tom really speaks French well .
You &apos;re the love of my life .
I have Monday off .
I &apos;d prefer to be left alone .
Tom came here from Boston .
I &apos;ll write a letter to Tom .
Where did you meet your boyfriend ?
Tom isn &apos;t listening to Mary .
What does Tom think of this ?
I wasn &apos;t looking for anything .
You should &apos;ve done it yourself .
I &apos;ll sit here and wait until Tom comes .
How was your summer ?
I hope you aren &apos;t too disappointed .
Tom is just like you .
The question is who will do it .
Tom won .
He came from another country .
She &apos;s not as shy as she used to be .
Is that such a bad thing ?
I hope Tom didn &apos;t take that too hard .
I know that I know it , but I can &apos;t remember it .
Tom knows that .
I hate myself and I want to die .
I can &apos;t hear anything at all .
Tom has broken something again .
Tom is now somewhere in Australia .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom to do that .
Please tell me where Tom is .
Don &apos;t walk away from me .
Get on with it .
Our teacher doesn &apos;t just speak English , but French too .
Tom made fun of Mary behind her back .
It &apos;s good to have you with us .
I knew we would be friends .
Tom bought the same camera that Mary has .
I don &apos;t know if I have the time .
All the girls are crazy about Tom .
It is hard for the couple to live together any longer .
I don &apos;t want to play with Tom .
Tom believes me .
They did it again .
No one will believe them .
I have to go get Tom .
This book is too difficult for you to read .
His uncle died five years ago .
The bus left five minutes ahead of time .
A cat has been on the table .
I drank a glass of milk .
I gave you my word .
Tom isn &apos;t as good at speaking French as you think he is .
Tom knows how to read French .
I need to talk to Tom .
Tom died a few years later .
We &apos;ll be living in Boston .
When I opened the window , I saw children playing baseball .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom about his brother John .
What I say is true .
Please remember what I tell you .
What &apos;s happened ?
Tom doesn &apos;t come here anymore .
Tom is the one who told me your phone number .
I need to ask you for a favor .
I don &apos;t speak French very much .
Is there anything in the box ?
You may come and see me once a week .
The baby is one day old .
I have no time to see you .
I love you more than ever .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever come here by himself .
It &apos;s my turn to choose where we eat .
You lost .
Tom is already hard at work .
You can &apos;t seat Tom next to Mary .
I would like you to meet my parents .
I just wish I knew what to say to my husband .
It &apos;s been raining since last night .
My uncle gave me a book .
I have to try .
We arrived at the hotel an hour ago .
What &apos;re you going to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem interested .
I spent hours reading books .
We know what we have to do .
It is impossible for me to answer the question .
Tom arrived in time .
Tom wanted to buy that book and give it to Mary .
How do you know there aren &apos;t any ?
Tom must be very happy .
I don &apos;t know what to do for dinner .
I know Tom is in love with Mary .
She got up late .
Look at the picture on the wall .
The news made her very sad .
Everything that I saw was completely different from what I had expected .
Tom is taking too long .
I think about him often .
Tom can play the piano .
No one was listening .
Tom can run fast .
What goes on in here ?
She began crying .
I &apos;m not going to make the same mistake again .
Don &apos;t you want one of these ?
I don &apos;t have any more money .
Nobody has ever spoken French to me .
Where has she gone ?
What did Tom have to do with it ?
Do you want something else ?
Did they say why ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet decided what to do .
Keep the door closed .
I know you said that .
Aren &apos;t you happy , Tom ?
Who sold you this car ?
All the students were there .
What is the best way to learn English ?
Tom got here late .
Do it now , Tom .
They &apos;ve been out there a long time .
Tom and Mary plan to have a party next week .
Tom won &apos;t be back tomorrow .
This was too much for Tom .
Tom and Mary must be very close .
She needs you .
We &apos;re not giving up on Tom .
Tom won &apos;t be back .
I don &apos;t have Tom &apos;s money .
What &apos;s the best way to learn French ?
I hope it &apos;s not Tom .
I lied about doing that .
Tom tried to stay calm .
I &apos;m waiting for Tom .
I could go for some pizza right now .
It looks like rain .
No one knew a thing .
Let me know once you &apos;ve decided when you &apos;ll come .
Tom won &apos;t talk to Mary .
I &apos;m happy , too .
I always listen to anything Tom has to say .
Tom pretended that it didn &apos;t matter to him that Mary was going out with John .
Tom kept still .
I was just about to go to bed .
You have good reason to be angry .
Tom knows that he can win .
Nothing can stop me .
Tom , why are you doing this ?
When was it that you first met her ?
She kept me waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve found something .
Tom has to stay .
Tom didn &apos;t need it anymore .
Tom believes he &apos;s right .
He has been to France three times .
Tom did it for me .
She must be angry with me .
Tom lives around here somewhere .
The computer is new .
What are you doing next Monday ?
I &apos;m the one with the money .
I just can &apos;t believe they &apos;re getting married .
I prefer reading to writing .
He became so ill that he died two hours later .
Tom thinks he knows the answer .
I know that &apos;s not what you want .
I can &apos;t stop thinking about what happened .
Can I sit down ?
Tom was right at home .
&quot; Are you sad ? &quot; &quot; No . Why would I be ? &quot;
I know about that .
I really don &apos;t want to do that .
Tom sat across the table from Mary .
How was the French class ?
I learned to live without her .
Tom said he decided it was too difficult to do .
Tom has a radio .
Why should they stop ?
Would you mind if I take a look ?
It &apos;s been three years since we got married .
He fell down on the floor .
You &apos;ll see the difference .
All you have to do is ask .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mom .
It &apos;s difficult to help people that don &apos;t want your help .
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon ?
I &apos;ve already told you that .
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t know .
The decision is yours .
Tom knew it was impossible .
We do not know her .
This is just too big for one person to carry .
I wonder who that girl is .
We &apos;re willing to learn .
How does Tom go to school ?
Tom has a cold now .
I was busy .
That doesn &apos;t happen .
This is a question for Tom .
I want to be with my family .
No one wants that .
No one &apos;s in there .
He must be tired .
Tom has a couple of friends in Australia .
Tom seemed lonely .
Tom is standing next to Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where we are .
It &apos;s what I want .
Tom wants to work .
He is working on the new plan .
Tom is sitting .
What in the world happened here ?
She was kissed by him .
How long is he going to stay in Japan ?
I know who my enemy is .
You can &apos;t really think this is funny .
Tom saw it .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
French is one of the languages that I speak .
Our cat is in the kitchen .
The light doesn &apos;t work .
It could &apos;ve been better .
Mary isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s wife .
We won &apos;t know until October .
Do you want Tom to do that ?
I don &apos;t think Tom liked the concert .
Tom asked me how to get to the post office .
Yesterday I heard a beautiful song .
This book is easy enough for me to read .
Don &apos;t you want to go , too ?
Don &apos;t let Tom eat this .
You always do that by yourself , don &apos;t you ?
Where do I come in ?
Tom &apos;s car was stolen last week .
Tom didn &apos;t have time .
It &apos;s a promise .
I know you like coffee .
I was looking for Tom , but Tom found me first .
I changed clothes .
I thought as much .
I think I &apos;ll walk to school today .
Be quiet for a moment .
That &apos;s really sweet .
I have the keys .
My uncle gave his car to me .
Tom isn &apos;t stupid .
Tom seemed quite pleased with himself .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to stay any longer .
She couldn &apos;t afford it .
When does Tom walk his dog ?
This is true .
Why aren &apos;t you at home ?
Tom happened to be there .
When will you come back ?
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name ?
I wish you &apos;d stop being afraid of me .
Who &apos;s standing ?
I don &apos;t like talking about this kind of thing .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me ?
We &apos;re going to get that .
Were you expecting someone ?
Let &apos;s go straight to the beach .
The girl always looked happy , but she wasn &apos;t at all happy .
Tom didn &apos;t know their names .
It &apos;s just one of those things .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re from around here .
I didn &apos;t know what I should say to Tom .
You think this is funny , don &apos;t you ?
Yesterday I was ill .
You can help .
We are not Americans .
There was a lot of food in the house .
You should never have done that .
Tom gave us that .
It &apos;s their job .
Let &apos;s thank Tom .
He promised to come , but he didn &apos;t come .
I &apos;ve been in business thirty years .
Tom saw that Mary wasn &apos;t in the room .
I &apos;m right .
Tom is walking .
I like to take my children to the beach .
Give me a reason .
I said good night to my parents and went to bed .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to know what he was doing .
We &apos;ve done what we can .
We &apos;re in the garden .
What are you going to say to Tom ?
What &apos;s there to say ?
I met her in the store by accident .
It &apos;ll be there .
He gave me a good piece of advice .
It &apos;s going to be fine , you know .
He is a head taller than me .
He listened to my opinion .
He worked far into the night .
We came here looking for you .
He was angry with his students .
I just want to support you .
I don &apos;t understand why she doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
We may as well start at once .
I &apos;ll be here .
Tom was tired after working all day .
What happened to the ship ?
I wonder why Tom wants that .
He got what he wanted .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what Mary said .
What Tom says is true .
Tom had questions .
We were very disappointed to hear the news .
I &apos;ll be back in just a few minutes .
You &apos;re talking too fast .
I wanted to spend more time with Tom .
Tom will deal with it .
Some of these books are quite old .
Please take another one .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
I am busy today .
Tom is hard at work .
It &apos;s alive .
I &apos;m happy for all of you .
He didn &apos;t have enough money to ride home on the train .
I think you &apos;re working way too hard .
Tom says he &apos;s never had a girlfriend .
That wasn &apos;t a mistake .
I want to wash my hair .
I want an explanation .
Is it a secret ?
I &apos;m happy , very happy .
Is everything OK here ?
I took a week off .
I can &apos;t put up with this noise anymore .
Tom saw Mary swimming .
Tom can swim .
We ran short of money .
I &apos;m taking a couple of days off .
I can see you &apos;re upset . What &apos;s wrong ?
How do you know that ?
We really need a man like you here .
Tom spent the night in jail .
I &apos;m going to your house .
Tom was just a little boy at that time .
Tom won &apos;t be going to school next week .
I have some reading to do .
How are we going to get off this island ?
She will never talk about it .
If you ever need a job , go see Tom .
I want to be happy , too .
It was a last minute decision .
I &apos;m taking Tom to Boston with me .
I didn &apos;t know him at the time .
He &apos;s much younger than Tom .
Tom and Mary both don &apos;t understand French at all .
Tom is abroad .
I think Tom is out .
It should be like this .
I saw her for the last time .
Tom never works on Sunday .
Did I ask your opinion ?
Where &apos;s your boyfriend ?
How many people are there in this room ?
Tom wants to see it .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was so happy .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything to eat ?
Aren &apos;t you late ?
Children will grow even if you leave them alone .
Is anybody home ?
The kitchen in that house is very nice .
Tom went to Boston yesterday .
No one really knows what &apos;s going on .
I don &apos;t want to lose you as a friend .
Tom bought a new car .
I have a dog and a cat .
These are good .
Were they in the library yesterday ?
He &apos;s writing a long letter .
I &apos;m going to wait here for you .
Tom went to the hospital yesterday .
They aren &apos;t there .
The new machine will take a lot of room .
I &apos;m not very good at singing .
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Is that a bird ?
What ship will you arrive on ?
I don &apos;t get along with him .
They aren &apos;t my books .
She &apos;s my sister .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
No one knew why .
My son is ten years old .
I live in Boston .
Tom died a few hours later .
He keeps his word .
Tom got into his car .
Do you think you &apos;ll be able to solve the problem by yourself ?
I came here to give you something .
Did they live here ?
Tom was right on time .
Tom actually held the door open for Mary .
Tom fell off the horse and broke his arm .
If Tom is right , Mary is in Boston now .
I knew you &apos;d like Boston .
It nearly cost him his life .
Tom likes to write .
Tom told Mary the truth .
I &apos;m one of your students .
Tom didn &apos;t work as hard as Mary did .
I didn &apos;t want anything .
Have you eaten yet ?
Bring along your friend .
Tom hates his life .
I &apos;m really worried about my child .
I left right away .
I came back home late .
Her father died when she was three .
They &apos;ll understand us .
We &apos;ll do everything we can to help you .
I don &apos;t see it .
I &apos;m very happy for Tom .
She gave him a book .
Tom promised to help us .
&quot; I saw the pictures . &quot; &quot; What pictures ? &quot;
What else do you need ?
Could you leave us alone ?
What &apos;s it doing out here ?
Tom was a little worried about Mary .
I &apos;m not as lucky as you .
She can play tennis very well , but I can play as well as she can .
Tom asked Mary what she wanted for her birthday .
Why is that a problem ?
Nobody can help me .
I know where Tom lived .
Tom might come .
Tom showed Mary &apos;s letter to me .
Would you date a man thirty years older than you ?
We &apos;ve got a long day tomorrow .
I have a good idea .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to church .
He may have been ill .
It &apos;s beautiful .
Show him in .
This desk , which I bought yesterday , is very big .
Tom made it on time .
We have a good life together .
Didn &apos;t you write him a letter ?
He thought I was my brother .
I &apos;ll do what you want .
This novel is too difficult for me to read .
How often do you eat vegetables ?
You must be Tom .
When did you arrive in China ?
My dream is to study abroad .
I heard that , but I didn &apos;t know it was true .
Tom has come to Boston .
Tom and I went shopping together .
She helped cook lunch .
Did anyone tell Tom ?
I &apos;ll make you a drink .
You &apos;re not me .
I don &apos;t know anything .
You &apos;re a good mother .
People who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t have to .
I think Tom is looking at us .
He told me that his father was a doctor .
Was all of that true ?
Do you like my shoes ?
I don &apos;t have anything to do now .
I &apos;ll stay at home today .
This book is so difficult that I can &apos;t read it .
He told me that the book was interesting .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
The water &apos;s not very warm .
I was in the area .
Tom isn &apos;t much younger than Mary .
I broke my arm .
Do you want to meet up after work ?
Tom probably didn &apos;t even know about the meeting .
Tom would do that .
I &apos;m sorry if I hurt your feelings .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s saying .
Tom gave me something I needed .
I don &apos;t eat bread .
I &apos;m busy now .
I wasn &apos;t feeling very well .
I know Tom is old .
May I go with you ?
I like watching TV .
We really have no choice .
Tom didn &apos;t see anything .
You are expected to pass the exam .
She is just as beautiful as her mother .
I don &apos;t like your coming late every day .
You &apos;re great at this .
Tom looks happy .
I couldn &apos;t get him on the phone .
Tom was sitting under a tree , drinking wine .
I don &apos;t know whether I will have time to do it .
I do not feel like drinking beer tonight .
What do I need to do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want our help .
Tom wants to go with us .
Where &apos;s Tom hiding ?
Both you and I are students .
I &apos;m very sorry .
I guess Tom is looking for Mary .
If you are hungry , why don &apos;t you eat ?
I like your car .
I &apos;d like to be with Tom .
There &apos;s no point talking to you , because you won &apos;t do as I say anyway .
I &apos;ll decide .
How much is a room ?
Why is no one here ?
Tom has never actually done that .
Are these your things ?
Let me out !
Everything else doesn &apos;t matter now .
I &apos;m very good at swimming .
Tom comes here every day .
Tom is still in the hospital .
This box is very heavy , so I can &apos;t carry it .
Can I speak to you outside ?
I answered the door .
Tom hasn &apos;t given us anything .
We keep three dogs and a cat .
Can you drive me home ?
Tom slept most of the afternoon .
I know your father very well .
I will come to your party this evening .
Why doesn &apos;t anybody help Tom ?
I &apos;m going to see Tom again .
Give it another shot .
Tom is out there .
I &apos;d like to see that movie .
Maybe we ought to ask Tom for advice .
Why are we doing that ?
What are we going to do with Tom ?
I worked on it day after day .
Tom hates children .
You look very tired .
Tom sat down next to Mary on the couch .
I was very proud of my son .
What &apos;s his name again ?
I just got my hair done .
Do you want me to stay or do you want me to go ?
I play with my cat .
He gave me what I needed .
We have finished lunch .
Were you expecting something different to happen ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom did a lot of things right .
Tom and Mary are watching TV .
He can come .
Is this correct ?
Is somebody there ?
Which one do you prefer ?
This is all I have to say .
You won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
Tom couldn &apos;t find Mary .
Just say whatever you want to say .
You shouldn &apos;t eat here .
Tom and Mary are in the kitchen .
I ate the apple .
You &apos;ll thank me .
She walked very carefully .
I promised Tom that I wouldn &apos;t cry .
You don &apos;t like Tom , do you ?
I knew you were going to ask that .
Tom and I are very busy just now .
He doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
We could make it on time if we walked a little faster .
He is taller than me by a head .
She is out of her mind .
Why do you come here ?
Let me do it .
Give it to me , please .
You don &apos;t have to do it .
Thanks for coming , Tom .
Tom will come later .
Tom is shopping .
This should be fun .
We know each other very well .
My father is a good speaker of English .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
I never give up .
I don &apos;t think Tom has enough money to buy that .
Tom needed money .
Tom began to kiss Mary .
I asked why Tom was late .
Tom hurt me .
How often do you work here ?
He will pay for everything .
As for me , I don &apos;t like eggs .
We learn English at school .
I think you should tell Tom .
What &apos;s the next station ?
Do you want to save them ?
Let the children play .
Do you really want me to tell Tom about you and Mary ?
Tom is young , but he knows what he &apos;s doing .
Where does this car come from ?
I &apos;ll be in my car .
We found it here .
What difference did that make ?
I have a message for Tom .
Are you satisfied , Tom ?
She will be coming to see us again soon .
We &apos;re here for the day .
That &apos;s no longer necessary .
Let me tell you what Tom said .
Why are we here again ?
Tom &apos;s shoes are too small for him .
He said he would come .
I &apos;ve already seen that movie .
I finally met Tom today .
I wonder if this is wrong .
I love Australia .
We don &apos;t have a chance .
Try to see things as they really are .
Tom died in Australia .
Tom helped .
I knew that would happen .
I don &apos;t know anything about her .
I call her very often .
I would &apos;ve liked that .
Tom knows nothing .
Can I use your pencil ?
Her book is red .
Tom looked at the clock .
Why should you want to do that ?
Did Tom work for you ?
He &apos;s angry at the world .
Why does no one believe me ?
Where does she live now ?
Tom is looking for a job .
They &apos;re going to do it for us .
She is out now .
He knows what &apos;s going on .
Tom didn &apos;t have time to finish his report .
How do we know that he &apos;s innocent ?
Tom and Mary just don &apos;t hit it off .
I didn &apos;t see Tom .
Did you say you had a cat ?
I will make a man out of you .
Tom &apos;s French is hard to understand .
How bad do you want it ?
My TV is broken .
How long have you been busy ?
Tom had never been to Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
Is your mother a good cook ?
Now I feel bad .
I &apos;m about the same age as you .
This first question is for you .
Let &apos;s play soccer .
I know somebody who speaks French very well .
She asked him to stay , but he had to go to work .
I think it &apos;s good .
She gave me a shy smile .
It made me forget about my problems .
Tom is a bit older than Mary .
I have lost my umbrella .
The problem is in that we don &apos;t have enough money .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this color .
I &apos;ll take that .
You have to show me what to do .
She is in a bad mood .
Are you sure he can do this ?
Can your brother drive a car ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t eat meat .
Is there a restaurant around here ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want kids .
Tom needs Mary .
How do you do this ?
I hope that Tom will come .
Tom rarely makes mistakes .
I wasn &apos;t mad at Tom .
Tom was one of three children .
I hear you .
I study French every day .
I was very impressed by his story .
He knows how to drive a car .
Tom is old school .
I come here every year .
He &apos;s kind of cute , isn &apos;t he ?
They know how to swim .
I got home at seven .
Let &apos;s have some fun .
They know where Tom is .
I loved Tom very much .
I thought that , too .
Do you think Tom likes Mary ?
Tom almost convinced me .
Tom was very nice to me .
We &apos;re not doing this again .
How many years have you been married ?
You make me happy .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary here ?
She gave him a piece of paper .
The teacher let the boy go home .
I can do this .
Do you want these ?
Tom is a very good boy .
Tom got in the car with Mary .
Why are you under the desk ?
We can &apos;t leave Tom alone .
Tom was worried sick about Mary .
I lost my umbrella .
You are seriously ill .
I like English .
Are you sure you &apos;re OK ?
He has no hat on .
Do you think Tom is innocent ?
I am convinced that he did nothing wrong .
Tom is a big boy .
We didn &apos;t say anything .
Is there anything that I can do for you ?
When did you come to Paris ?
What does Tom have to do ?
Don &apos;t talk about me like I &apos;m not here .
I wish I could remember where I left my umbrella .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to stay home to help Mary .
Come on . Give it a try .
I know that you &apos;ve been waiting for this .
Tom is interested by many things .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help me .
Don &apos;t you want to know where I was ?
Do you know why Tom did it ?
There is little water left .
Tom showed Mary around the city .
My mother always gets up early in the morning .
We never forget .
Who does Tom usually go shopping with ?
I heard that Tom asked you to help him wash his car .
I &apos;m not sure whether to stay home or go out .
Why are people afraid of the police ?
It is dark in that room .
I have you to thank .
This game can be played by young children .
I was only gone an hour .
I won &apos;t change my mind .
He &apos;s two years older than I am .
Most of her friends are boys .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his family .
Tom likes Mary , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
I get on well with him .
She told her son to wait a minute .
The shop is closed on Sunday .
Do you know something I don &apos;t know ?
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m ready .
Tom is watching a movie on his computer .
I &apos;m feeling much better today .
Where &apos;s my horse ?
Is it true what they say about Tom ?
It &apos;s warm today .
Tom usually leaves home at seven .
Come on up , Tom .
Take off your glasses .
I think they know us .
We were too late .
Why do you want Tom ?
I speak three languages .
Tom is coming to Boston with us .
You managed it after all .
Nobody could decide as to what to do .
Tom slowly raised his gun .
Tom came from a family who didn &apos;t talk about their feelings .
Tom likes to do things by himself .
She appears to have many friends .
How is your family ?
I can &apos;t stop thinking about it .
I took it .
Give me your knife .
I wanted to help you .
They don &apos;t teach you that in school .
How was lunch ?
I can still remember that day .
Tom slept on the couch .
Do you want to see me again ?
Nobody &apos;s happy .
How are you feeling now ?
I don &apos;t know if I can stay .
Why &apos;s Tom here and not Mary ?
Tom asked me why I worked so hard .
Tom knows he &apos;s right .
My little brother is watching TV .
Do you actually feel sorry for Tom ?
How was the beach ?
I could have lost my job .
Who will write the report ?
That was so much fun .
I knew you &apos;d ask Tom to do that .
He will be here all evening .
How about tomorrow night ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like it .
I &apos;d like to give it to Tom .
This would be better than that .
Who &apos;d buy this ?
Tom went to the city by bus .
&quot; I am happy , &quot; she said to herself .
I don &apos;t know exactly .
I didn &apos;t know what to say .
He began to talk to the dog .
You only have to ask for it .
I went into the house .
The sky is clear almost every day .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom who my father was .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still hungry .
Why don &apos;t you eat some vegetables ?
I think Tom needs a vacation .
How long will we have ?
You should go see a doctor .
It was my idea .
Nothing is impossible .
I should read the book .
I think he is right .
It all changed .
Tom forgot to do his homework .
Tom may do as he likes .
I don &apos;t really remember all that much about what happened .
She &apos;s loved by her friends .
Will there be anything else ?
Why are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
It was better in the old days .
We &apos;re from here .
Tom never actually lived in Boston .
You &apos;ll be missed by your friends .
My book is very heavy .
I want to teach you something .
How far is it from here to your house ?
Tom never gets sick .
Did you kiss Tom ?
We haven &apos;t been able to find out much else .
I &apos;ve got no friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough friends .
I &apos;m going to study English this afternoon .
I &apos;d like to tell her that I love her .
Is eating less meat a good idea ?
You &apos;re one of us now .
My brother is eight years older than me .
I need to be sure that you understand this .
I was worried about his health .
Tom is going to get fired .
Where is the book ?
Bring your brother with you .
I can &apos;t live without Tom .
My bike was stolen yesterday .
The door wouldn &apos;t shut .
Tom appears to be a bit nervous .
Can you handle it ?
You didn &apos;t invite me .
My brother is two years older than I am .
It isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s fault .
Didn &apos;t I ask you not to do that ?
You should &apos;ve been here .
What are you going to do next year ?
It was rather easy for them .
That would be dangerous .
Tom &apos;s lucky .
I have more than one friend who can &apos;t swim .
I can &apos;t do anything about it .
I let my sister use my new computer .
I can &apos;t believe you did all this without any help .
The cat is sitting on the table .
The village I live in is very small .
I don &apos;t need a lot of money .
We &apos;re confused .
Tom hates Christmas .
I &apos;m free on Sunday .
I didn &apos;t want milk .
What &apos;re you doing with this ?
Tom &apos;s not in the hospital .
He had no money and so could not buy any food .
I think we should do it .
No one is in the room .
I &apos;ve forgotten Tom completely .
I didn &apos;t realize it until much later .
I have a big brother .
I &apos;ve learned a good deal from you .
Tom would &apos;ve called Mary if he &apos;d had her phone number .
This is where Tom met Mary for the first time .
He didn &apos;t show up at the breakfast .
I &apos;m going to miss you , too .
Tom brought his dog over to Mary &apos;s house .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me .
I heard that Tom did that .
How long have you been waiting for the bus ?
That &apos;s how we do it .
Go back to your room .
Tom has no idea how long it will take .
We &apos;ve all done that .
This isn &apos;t about us .
You have done very well .
Tom looks like his father .
Where do you have to be ?
He was out of town last week .
I have to go back to work now .
I &apos;m here to save you .
This was meant as a joke .
Why are you doing this to Tom ?
You didn &apos;t come to school yesterday , did you ?
Your French is very good .
I don &apos;t see Tom doing that .
He fell asleep while reading a book .
Please come back at once .
Which way is the beach ?
Tom says he &apos;s OK .
Take as much as you want .
I &apos;ve always loved you , Tom .
Who caught Tom ?
I think that I &apos;ll do that .
I just want to know why you brought me here .
I &apos;m disappointed in you .
He died yesterday .
It &apos;s not going to take long .
You must not open the door .
Tom has left for good .
Today is a good day to die .
What should we do next ?
I am better than you .
Tom looks dead .
She put on her hat .
You &apos;ll never change .
She needs him more than he needs her .
The train arrived on time .
Tom has known Mary ever since they were children .
Tom is going to love living here .
We did that yesterday .
What did you do with Tom ?
What time do you go to bed ?
She did it for her children .
I know how to do this .
I can &apos;t remember why I did that .
I would go to the movies if I had the time .
Tom had nothing to do yesterday .
Tom bought too much bread .
Can I eat this ?
Don &apos;t be afraid . I won &apos;t hurt you .
What does Tom know about this ?
That &apos;s a big mistake .
May I swim in this lake ?
I wish I had gone with the others to the game yesterday .
Tom is very sick .
Tom said he never saw Mary .
That &apos;s totally wrong .
I heard someone call my name .
Tom sat down next to me .
Look at these .
Did you catch the first train ?
I &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re in danger .
Can we believe that ?
I &apos;m nervous and scared .
Tom spent a week in Boston .
He spoke well of her son .
Tom said he wanted to help .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary does .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
Tom likes to show off .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
I have just finished eating .
I really don &apos;t feel like talking right now .
I know his family .
I think that you &apos;re right .
You know Tom won &apos;t do that , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m trying to solve the problem .
If I &apos;d wanted your opinion , I &apos;d have asked for it .
I gave him my address .
Tom studied French for three hours last night .
Why didn &apos;t Tom come ?
No one &apos;s coming to our party tonight .
I &apos;ll always love you , no matter what happens .
It seems very interesting .
I &apos;m glad it &apos;s all over .
How much are you making ?
I &apos;ve been looking for a new job for a long time .
Who can speak French better , Tom or Mary ?
We &apos;re very busy .
She locked the door .
Did Tom do that ?
Why don &apos;t we call it a day ?
That &apos;d be dangerous .
The garden is in front of the house .
I know what your name is .
I don &apos;t have anything to read .
We &apos;ll fix this .
Were you there ?
Tom was strong .
I wish that you wouldn &apos;t do that .
What language does Tom usually speak ?
Is that what you want ?
She has few friends .
Where do you think we are ?
There is nothing I can do to change that .
I &apos;m all right .
Are you getting this ?
That can &apos;t be .
Tom never talks about his family .
Tom and Mary have been here for three hours .
When do I get my car back ?
I feel better every day .
He finally broke up with that woman .
What &apos;re you going to say ?
I want to ask you a favor .
You should apologize .
I was really cute when I was a kid .
I want that one .
He &apos;s studying now .
You can still help Tom , can &apos;t you ?
Did he go home yesterday ?
Tom sent Mary a message .
Are you almost ready ?
If I were you , I &apos;d start immediately .
I &apos;m not here for a vacation .
He said good night to his parents .
I don &apos;t understand English .
I &apos;d rather not meet him .
No one has come .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was Mary &apos;s boss .
I don &apos;t like cats .
You must not go there with them .
Why are you doing this ?
Tom isn &apos;t alive .
Where were you guys today ?
Tom bought some vegetables and fruit .
We &apos;ll leave as soon as you &apos;re ready .
Tom said Mary would come .
I think Tom is up .
I &apos;m sure that she &apos;s correct .
I can &apos;t believe Tom killed Mary .
We both know it &apos;s too late .
I have just three dollars left .
Do you know what his name is ?
Tom was better .
I know it myself .
When does the last train leave ?
What is going on here ?
Let me die .
Tom knows something Mary doesn &apos;t .
Why can &apos;t I sing like they can ?
What are we going to do about it ?
How long did Tom work here ?
Tom made Mary do the work .
I don &apos;t want to go out .
Were you at home yesterday ?
Tom is a little crazy .
He went to the hospital yesterday .
Tom is still looking for Mary .
I wonder if he will come .
It sounds impossible , but it &apos;s true .
Would you like to be famous ?
Tom won &apos;t make it in time .
Let &apos;s start as soon as he comes .
They all speak French .
Tom looks tired , doesn &apos;t he ?
I have a feeling I &apos;ve met her somewhere before .
Come here quickly .
I will take care of the flowers .
I can &apos;t stand kids .
He has half as many books as I do .
You &apos;ve got to stay awake .
She wrote to him to tell him that she couldn &apos;t come to visit next summer .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary likes John .
I don &apos;t care how you do it . Just do it .
You look fat .
Do your best !
How can you be so sure ?
What &apos;re you doing there ?
I wanted to go to the beach with Tom .
Are you coming with us ?
Tom got rich quickly .
He killed that man .
Tom spoke to Mary about the matter .
Tom wondered why his wife left him .
Tom will sing .
Tom showed me how to solve the problem .
Tom probably won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Don &apos;t you say a word .
I do want to see you .
I don &apos;t think Tom will be able to do that .
He may not be happy .
I don &apos;t know where Tom is staying .
All of us are disappointed .
Can you give my brother a job ?
What are you doing here so late at night ?
Where else in Boston do you want to visit ?
Tom left his keys with me .
It will rain tomorrow .
I &apos;ve always wanted to study French .
That &apos;s just the way things were back then .
He was listening to music .
I think I know why .
You worry too much .
I will do what I need to do .
I have a feeling you &apos;ll be a very good lawyer .
Tom isn &apos;t the one who needs help .
Tom likes fish .
She is not as old as my sister is .
How much did you pay for the dress ?
I can &apos;t find a good job .
Tom has lost his umbrella .
This is something you need to do alone .
Let me do that .
When do you want it ?
I knew you would come .
What makes you think that ?
Is that as fast as you can go ?
The letter returned .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to answer Mary &apos;s question .
Tom and Mary are gone .
They were not impressed .
Tom is quite good at his job .
He used to drink beer .
Have you tried it yet ?
I &apos;m against it .
I saw Tom there .
Tom hates Mary .
Tom ran home as fast as he could .
This is not my ticket .
The train leaves at six .
Is that love ?
Tom is the one with experience , not me .
I &apos;m planning to stay at the hotel .
I &apos;ll be fine here .
You look exactly like Tom .
Who were you talking to ?
I think they like you .
I should have taken the money .
You do like me , don &apos;t you ?
I wish I could help .
I have to go to Australia next month .
Tom needed more .
Tom eats rice at least once a day .
That &apos;s a good price .
Tom wrote a letter .
I want kids .
We learned how to read French in school , but didn &apos;t really learn how to speak it .
I feel kind of bad for Tom .
I &apos;m surprised you weren &apos;t invited .
I &apos;m no longer tired .
You need us .
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone who he really was .
I want to know what you know .
Tom listened to Mary &apos;s story .
They knew nothing .
What do you think it &apos;s for ?
Do you think I want this ?
Let me explain it to you .
It happened completely by accident .
You go right ahead .
I couldn &apos;t go to work because I was sick .
He seems to be rich now .
I &apos;ll stay home .
I &apos;ll see you in Boston .
Is it OK to do that here ?
Tom isn &apos;t coming home with us .
Do they know that we know ?
He &apos;s the man that was here last week .
I knew that today would be fun .
I don &apos;t think you should eat that .
I told Tom that his French was easy to understand .
You will be safe with me .
Children really like playing on the beach .
Why are you asking me this ?
Tom and Mary have lived in Boston for three years .
Both of you are right .
I don &apos;t hate children !
I &apos;m not so good at tennis .
They &apos;re very happy .
I &apos;d like to speak with Tom alone .
You &apos;d better come in .
I gave one to Tom , too .
I am good at history .
I &apos;m good at cooking .
You &apos;ll do it .
No matter what I do , she says I can do better .
We had fun with it .
Try to learn a little English .
That sounds like the kind of thing he &apos;d do .
It should be fun .
Tom never showed up last night .
Would you mind telling me why you &apos;re here ?
Tom isn &apos;t my friend .
The door closed slowly .
Tom could hardly wait to tell Mary .
I would like to go to the concert with you .
I like going to the movies .
Tom and Mary watched the movie together .
I like to be at home .
Tom always seems to be there at the same time I am .
I have a proposal .
Do you have somewhere to stay ?
We can talk .
I &apos;ll be able to help you .
Tom raised his glass .
Maybe I should go .
I &apos;m not taking the bus .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like the man in the picture .
She came three minutes after I called .
I &apos;m not a good person .
How did you get Tom to give you so much money ?
What &apos;s your problem ?
She was alone in the house .
I didn &apos;t call .
Did you understand what he had in mind ?
Is that all you &apos;ve got to say ?
I can &apos;t pay Tom today .
You can &apos;t wear those clothes to work .
The two languages have a lot in common .
You must look after the child .
I lost a lot of money .
I wonder what Tom is reading .
Tom is already asleep .
I &apos;m going to be a teacher .
I know that you &apos;re disappointed .
Tom is out , but Mary is here .
It was worth a try .
Tom is on his way to work .
Tom needed work .
I have work to do .
What did you do there ?
Why don &apos;t you go see Tom ?
We need a little sugar .
Are you Tom &apos;s brother ?
What did you tell Tom ?
His explanation doesn &apos;t make sense at all .
We &apos;re out of wine .
We want to see it .
Tom knew there was no point in talking to Mary .
Who else is gone today ?
Tom has a family to support .
Tom talks quickly .
Thanks for the cake .
It sounds like a dream .
I had nothing else to say .
Why don &apos;t we ask Tom to help ?
Tom has asked Mary to marry him three times .
I wasn &apos;t able to finish doing that as soon as I thought I &apos;d be able to .
She wouldn &apos;t even speak to him .
Don &apos;t you want to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t really want to live in Boston .
I &apos;m going to kill myself .
We have only three days .
You can do it , can &apos;t you ?
You seem busy .
Tom knew something was off .
We &apos;re in trouble .
Tom will know .
Tom suddenly fell ill .
I do think I understand .
I want him to play the guitar .
I really want to be a good teacher .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you a long time .
Tom says he needs my help tomorrow .
Tom may sing .
Do you want me to go home ?
I &apos;ll do it as soon as I can .
You &apos;re going with me , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom may be hot .
I &apos;ll give you money .
It &apos;s not that interesting .
Which cup is yours ?
Give that back to me .
His name isn &apos;t Tom .
I was correct .
I &apos;m going to wait here for Tom .
Now that we &apos;re alone , let &apos;s have fun .
Tom became very lonely .
I feel like doing something different today .
Tom can win .
I &apos;m going to the village tomorrow .
Do you want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
It was only a dream .
Tom has Monday off .
Can I use your phone ?
That makes me really sad .
I want them .
Tom says he &apos;s always wanted to study French .
I think Tom likes you .
Why did Tom lie ?
Tom was different .
I think you &apos;re the only one who needs help .
I know what Tom said .
I can &apos;t believe I didn &apos;t even think of that .
I always have something to do .
Please don &apos;t hurt Tom .
I prefer coffee .
Have any of you read that book ?
I wanted to go back to your village .
Tom &apos;s not very good at it .
I think we can help each other .
Tom told everyone that Mary knew how to do that .
You might not find it .
There &apos;s only one way to be sure .
You &apos;ve taught us a great deal .
Who &apos;s the man playing the piano ?
I have got to go now .
There is an apple under the desk .
It &apos;s yours .
We are having lunch .
Tom works from nine to five .
May I eat this bread ?
Tom is quite busy just now .
Would you like me to explain it to you ?
I &apos;m feeling a little tired .
The cats are afraid of water .
I want to go to bed .
He was absent from school yesterday because he was sick .
Tom was in Australia last month , wasn &apos;t he ?
When &apos;s Tom coming home ?
Have you ever been to America ?
Tom sat under a tree .
It &apos;s already nine o &apos;clock .
I want to give Tom this .
Where are they off to ?
I like to know what &apos;s going on .
Tom and I were talking about Australia .
That &apos;s for you to decide .
I really like you .
We &apos;re not doing that again .
How was I dressed then ? Do you remember ?
He ran faster than his brother did .
Is there any coffee in the kitchen ?
I should &apos;ve asked Tom for advice .
Did you decide to go to Japan ?
I &apos;ll go by car .
We will be happy to help .
He made her his wife .
Tom noticed that his hands weren &apos;t clean .
Do you go there often ?
Tom stopped everything .
Tom will cry .
I &apos;d like to ask a few more questions .
I have a right to know what &apos;s going on here .
Tom speaks French really well .
We were surprised when we saw him in the office this morning .
I &apos;ll never be your friend .
They sat side by side .
I wanted everyone to get along .
He ran as fast as he could .
I had a lot of fun at the party .
How much did you pay ?
Tom only has eyes for Mary .
Tom saw something behind Mary .
I play tennis once in a while .
I &apos;m not worried about him .
I &apos;m not going to do that with Tom .
I &apos;d like you to have this .
I appreciate it .
I would like to ask a favor of you .
I &apos;m going to Australia .
Tom wants to do that , too .
I don &apos;t want to take your money .
Tom had to stay at home all week .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary doing that .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t care .
I can &apos;t see anything from here .
Where is Tom ?
I &apos;ll be free tomorrow afternoon .
Tom &apos;s death was an accident .
I told Tom to go home .
Tom asked me if I found what I was looking for .
Where is the restaurant ?
We both have to stay in Australia until the end of October .
He was at home .
I thought it might be true .
I can explain it all .
He let us go .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
Would you prefer to speak in French ?
You can &apos;t stay for long .
Tom asked me if I was happy .
If you won &apos;t tell Tom , I will .
Tom and Mary now live in Boston .
It went just as we expected .
I &apos;m not at all scared .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow if I can .
Tell me why you did it .
It gets better .
I am from China .
Tom speaks French as well as me .
I couldn &apos;t sleep at all .
You know there &apos;s no way I can do that without some help , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has two children .
Germany of today is not what it was ten years ago .
The weather is bad , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m very scared .
What is Tom to you ?
What do you say we go to my house ?
I think about her a lot .
She decided to get married to Tom .
Why do you think ?
We need at least eight hours of sleep each day .
I love Monday !
Tom isn &apos;t going to want to do that .
I want to try it . It looks fun .
You know that I don &apos;t like Tom .
The bicycle under the tree is mine .
Today &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
Both Tom and I were scared .
Come and see me tomorrow .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will like this idea .
I cannot carry this suitcase by myself .
Please phone him .
I often played baseball when I was young .
Both of my parents are still living .
There were many children in the room .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll come .
You are no younger than I am .
I want to see Tom so bad .
I &apos;m a policeman .
My father has just come home .
Everyone hates me .
You &apos;re our only hope .
Have you already started learning French ?
I want Tom to see these .
How old do I look ?
Tom got a new job .
I love coming here .
It was big .
Make me happy .
Tom arrived late .
I need a new car .
I found this under your bed .
I need only one cat .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come yet .
Tom promised that that &apos;ll never happen again .
I &apos;ll go home and get it .
Tom is the only one who wants to go home early .
My father bought me this hat .
Now I &apos;m sad .
She used to play tennis every Sunday .
Tom didn &apos;t have long to wait .
Tom left the water running .
They can understand me .
I often speak French with my friends .
I &apos;ll never forget .
This made me think of you .
You &apos;re not the one who died .
I lost everything I had .
You &apos;d better not have drunk all the milk .
I came to give you this .
When can we see each other again ?
Tom is very important .
Tom asked Mary about her new boyfriend .
I will go when they come back here .
What I told you yesterday wasn &apos;t true .
Tom wants to come home .
Do you really want to stay young forever ?
She gave a cat some milk .
My head does hurt a little .
I will deal with them myself .
We will talk about this later .
I will give her the book tomorrow .
You &apos;d better go now .
Tom was the only one who laughed .
Tom &apos;s not coming , because I don &apos;t want him to .
You can go if you want to .
I would rather not talk about it .
Do you know how to dance ?
Tom knows .
I don &apos;t like it down here .
Who was the book written by ?
Tom was the only one not wearing a suit .
He was stupid enough to believe her .
Tom knew Mary wasn &apos;t very hungry .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to the lake .
I have two friends who live in Germany .
Take care !
He will be ready .
I prefer that dress to this one .
Since I was cold , I put on my coat .
I had nothing left to eat .
Tom asked if any of us could speak French .
I want to know why you did that .
Japan is not what it was ten years ago .
His mother and sister were sick .
I want a lot more .
I like tea .
Someone opened the door .
He &apos;s about the same age as you are .
She invited him in .
Please keep on working even when I &apos;m not here .
I can live with that .
I don &apos;t need your help , but you need mine .
Can you show us the house ?
Don &apos;t worry about it !
Mary spent all her time working .
She asked how his father was .
What &apos;s wrong with that ?
What &apos;re you saying ?
Tom knows Mary &apos;s father .
I &apos;m not interested in what Tom thinks .
Tom said he isn &apos;t going to eat until Mary gets home .
It &apos;s not cold .
I like Tom better .
Do you like baseball ?
I don &apos;t want you to go .
I can &apos;t tell you their names .
I can tell this has been difficult for you .
I hope Tom won &apos;t be disappointed .
I thought that he was honest .
Have you already fed the dog ?
We &apos;ll work .
Tom can read and write .
I ate an apple .
Come over !
Both of the brothers are dead .
He asked me what was the matter with me .
What a big dog that is !
I &apos;m not quite sure yet .
He may be the very man that I need .
All you have to do is to meet her there .
Tom met Mary at work .
We aren &apos;t kids anymore .
What &apos;s in this box ?
Come and see me on Sunday next week .
Tom barely speaks to us anymore .
Tom can cook very well .
I &apos;d like you to leave now .
Tom made me promise not to tell Mary his phone number .
Tom isn &apos;t listening .
Tom made Mary tell him everything .
Tom thinks Mary should apologize to John .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be in love .
Why did you say that to Tom ?
Leave it alone .
Tom is in love with Mary .
Tom is over there standing by the window .
Tom won &apos;t leave me alone .
I just don &apos;t want to be disappointed again .
Tom is old enough to drive a car .
My mother hates writing letters .
Tom is the only one who would know the answer to that question .
Tom has a picture of his children on his desk .
I don &apos;t know how to drive .
What kind of game is this ?
I &apos;m driving to Boston on Monday .
I &apos;m no longer studying French .
I asked him if he wanted a watch .
I heard everything .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t ready yet .
I &apos;m sorry , did you say something ?
I loved Boston .
I got out of jail yesterday .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that for Mary .
Tom can &apos;t make it to the meeting .
I &apos;d like some coffee .
I don &apos;t need an explanation .
They look very tired .
The boy caught a large fish .
Tom put the key into his pocket .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand this .
What &apos;re you guys doing later ?
I want one , too .
My watch is five minutes fast .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
This is my sister &apos;s camera .
He talks as if he were rich .
Tom died .
You must be new around here .
I don &apos;t know what to believe anymore .
Can I use this bike ?
I believe you &apos;re honest .
It happened by accident .
Today is your birthday .
I need a little help .
Why would you want to do something like that ?
We don &apos;t have a lot of time .
How were you able to do all that ?
Tom almost lost his eye .
I believe that Tom is innocent .
Have you sold it yet ?
This story is true .
Why don &apos;t you believe Tom when he says he &apos;s busy ?
All you need to do is trust each other .
I think Tom had a good reason .
Tom is somewhere here in the park .
Tom would rather speak French .
I have to be up at six .
Let &apos;s finish this work as soon as possible .
Who was that sitting in front of you at the movies ?
I like it when it &apos;s hot .
What &apos;s it worth ?
You and I are old friends .
He is watching TV .
Do you have a boyfriend ?
Who am I ?
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father .
I think we should get help .
Tom did well in school .
My eyes are tired .
My mother looks young for her age .
English is pretty hard , isn &apos;t it ?
I only hope we &apos;re not too late .
That &apos;s not good for your health .
Where have you been ? Your mom is worried sick .
He was kind enough to show me the way to the station .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word about it !
What were you doing there ?
You were supposed to be there by 2 : 30 .
You can &apos;t tell me what to do .
I just saw Tom .
He asked about the others .
No , I don &apos;t want to .
What will you make ?
Thanks for this .
You &apos;re good at this .
What else did you eat ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I do .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is happy .
There was absolutely no doubt .
Do you have many friends ?
I &apos;m not going .
Would you like to eat with us ?
Has your father arrived yet ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to play tennis with Mary .
Tom is studying at his desk .
Where did you get the idea ?
I want Mary .
No one in his class is faster than he is .
She sent me a letter .
Tom never makes his bed .
I am very glad to meet you .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
They are satisfied with the contract .
I &apos;m very happy about that .
I don &apos;t know exactly where .
I &apos;m running a little late .
Tom has a sister about your age .
We want you to be happy .
Come and see me .
I have what you want .
Why do you look so sad today ?
Are you planning on buying a car ?
We weren &apos;t doing anything !
I am in London .
Everyone knew the song .
Can you show me how to do that job ?
Tom sometimes goes to work by car .
Can someone help me ?
You know your stuff .
I have a few things to take care of .
Take a look around you .
Tom just sat around and did nothing .
We &apos;re fine here .
I &apos;m popular .
I don &apos;t speak English .
He stole money from me .
This meat is good .
I received a letter three months later .
I learned a lot .
Do you want some soup ?
I went to sleep .
You &apos;d better let me do that for you .
I &apos;m going running .
Tom told Mary a joke , but she didn &apos;t think it was funny .
Did I miss something ?
He is used to the work .
Tom is definitely over thirty .
I don &apos;t like driving in Boston .
I &apos;ll be back late .
What do you think of his new novel ?
Tom has just told me that he found a new job .
&quot; Whose glasses are these ? &quot; &quot; They are my father &apos;s . &quot;
What &apos;ll Tom win ?
My parents live in the country .
I never had the chance to talk with Tom .
Which is older , this book or that one ?
You didn &apos;t tell Tom anything , did you ?
I would like to drink a coffee .
I was late for the last bus .
Both of us can speak French .
When you go , I &apos;ll miss you very much .
I feel bad .
Tom said that doing that was a mistake and that he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
I &apos;m really fast .
Are you coming ?
Tom worked in Australia .
It &apos;s rather cold today .
I live in a hotel .
Do you know why Tom didn &apos;t win ?
I lived in a small town .
Tom told Mary about his plan .
That &apos;s my problem with Tom .
Tom did the best he could .
I just want your love .
I may never see you again .
Don &apos;t pick up the cat .
Tom is not famous .
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s suitcase .
Her hair is long .
What kind of women do you like ?
I don &apos;t know her .
Tom has been to Boston only once .
You can &apos;t do this .
I &apos;m not happy here .
I need to ask you to leave .
I think he won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t take his own life .
When do you intend to start ?
I &apos;ve read a lot of books .
We have had more snow than usual this winter .
It &apos;s a lot of fun to listen to music .
She wants to dance .
What time will Tom arrive in Boston ?
We tell each other everything .
He made mistake after mistake .
I made that dress by myself .
You &apos;re not the only one who doesn &apos;t believe Tom .
I don &apos;t want to go home .
This machine does not run well .
He doesn &apos;t need to work .
That could change .
Many of my friends can speak French .
My mother likes tea very much .
John was born in a hospital and he died in a hospital .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to do that alone .
I can &apos;t believe I just said that .
Is there some reason why Tom isn &apos;t here today ?
Do you know what has become of him ?
I don &apos;t know why people do that .
In any case , I &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
There &apos;s no one with Tom .
They &apos;re in Boston .
We are expecting a baby .
Tom can &apos;t walk anymore .
Where did you put my passport ?
Tom was dead .
I &apos;ll come back later .
I need to know by tomorrow .
This clock isn &apos;t working .
Could you make time for me ?
Tom looked around the room , but he didn &apos;t see Mary .
Tom wanted to know why Mary wasn &apos;t here .
I forget your telephone number .
Tom can &apos;t help but be impressed by Mary &apos;s courage .
Tom said that yesterday .
This is my bag .
He is playing here .
You are not to speak to him while he is studying .
What does it matter to us ?
Who told you I would be here ?
Will you please go there ?
Tom wanted to see Mary .
Tom wanted to talk with you .
I will do anything but this .
He loves his daughter , but his wife doesn &apos;t .
Your father wants you .
What was the question ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why he &apos;s here .
Are you proud of your father ?
It &apos;s my life .
Tom didn &apos;t want to dance anymore .
I knew it was wrong .
I hardly ever get sick .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
Isn &apos;t that where we first met ?
Is Tom going to be here ?
What &apos;re they going to do to Tom and Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t mean it .
I wish you could come with us .
Come back .
I think they want you to do it .
I &apos;m not going away .
We have less than three hours .
Tom said you would come .
Why are they doing that ?
I have to go to the hospital .
I tried to make sure that everyone had fun .
You don &apos;t really mean it , do you ?
Did you really do that ?
I can sleep on the couch .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
I &apos;ll call you up tomorrow .
He &apos;s two years younger than me .
Tell me what to do .
I didn &apos;t give Tom choice .
Why are you leaving so soon ?
&quot; I asked you a question . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t hear you . &quot;
May I stay with you for a few days ?
I need to go back to Boston .
Do you really want to have kids ?
I can &apos;t hear Tom .
Would you please stop singing ?
The woman is reading .
There &apos;s a man here that wants to see you .
He doesn &apos;t listen to me .
She pretended that she knew nothing about it .
We &apos;re standing .
This is driving me crazy .
Tom is doing his work .
Tom told me to leave the room immediately .
I have only a small garden .
I pretended not to understand what he was saying .
It &apos;s mine , not his .
We have no idea what to do .
Tom is still on the job .
Can you put the children to bed ?
Are you finished here ?
We &apos;ll come together .
I wish I were younger .
We finally did it .
I was born in this hospital .
It &apos;s time to go to bed .
We made it .
I know you &apos;re not like Tom .
Tom left his wife .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary was in a bad mood this morning .
That &apos;s what Tom says .
You alone can help me .
We need money .
Have you been to London ?
I &apos;m not so sure now .
I hope to hear from you .
I haven &apos;t understood anything you &apos;ve said .
I really appreciate all your help .
Tom was lying on the couch , reading a book .
I watch TV almost every evening .
I &apos;ll study your report .
My brother caught a big fish .
Tom went back outside .
We &apos;re still friends .
My younger sister is famous .
Tom gave me a dictionary .
He &apos;s sound asleep .
You know about Tom , don &apos;t you ?
It is getting dark outside .
She &apos;s in a bad mood .
Are you Tom &apos;s lawyer ?
Do you have time to help us tomorrow ?
It &apos;s been quite a week .
Not everyone agreed .
It doesn &apos;t matter to me one bit .
There isn &apos;t any milk left .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about his feelings .
That &apos;s the house where I used to live .
I believe Tom is correct .
Is your father rich ?
I did what had to be done .
Tom told me that it wasn &apos;t true .
Tom is small for his age .
At what hour was she born ?
He works at a bank .
I wonder why nobody told me .
Can you do some shopping for me ?
Tom hates cats .
Aren &apos;t you scared , Tom ?
Why aren &apos;t you with the others ?
We &apos;re doing it together .
What did Tom have ?
Tom said he left his keys at home .
Have you finished dinner ?
He bought me a new dictionary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the answer yet .
He came here to help me .
It wasn &apos;t funny at all .
I &apos;ll be with you right away .
I live in Boston with my family .
I want to go with Tom .
Everyone is talking about it .
I went to school on foot in those days .
I thought Tom had convinced Mary not to buy that .
Tom would never have done that that way .
We &apos;ll look for it .
I have nothing in common with him .
She doesn &apos;t know how to play golf .
Tom said he saw Mary doing that .
I would like to tell you something .
I don &apos;t remember that at all .
They &apos;re eating apples .
I still have things left to do .
You &apos;re not even safe in your own home .
That &apos;s not what I saw .
I made Tom happy .
What else do you know ?
It is stupid of you to believe in him .
Where is my clock ?
Take a walk .
I think that &apos;s Tom .
I don &apos;t feel like watching TV tonight .
Could you bring us the bill , please ?
How do you know there isn &apos;t one ?
I &apos;d be happy to show it to you .
I &apos;m in my car .
Why do I have to be here ?
Where is he playing ?
Why are we doing this again ?
Has something else happened ?
I could swim faster when I was young .
There &apos;s something I forgot to tell you .
We have less than two hours .
It &apos;s too small .
We &apos;d like to help .
Tom knows where Mary lives .
I was just talking to Tom .
Come and help me out .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever wait for anybody .
It is necessary for you to work hard .
They are reading her book .
I just want to take a picture .
Please find a solution to the problem .
I think I &apos;m smart .
You can &apos;t study too hard .
It &apos;s a lot of work .
When do you plan to start ?
My French has gotten a lot better .
I &apos;m all alone now .
They all looked at Tom .
He can &apos;t read .
I don &apos;t have the time for this .
I don &apos;t have time for reading .
Can we talk alone ?
I &apos;m not going to say that .
I need a place I can study .
Tom was always different from other children .
Isn &apos;t it great ?
They &apos;ll be afraid .
Tom thought only of Mary .
Tom gets angry very easily .
Would you mind telling me what you &apos;re doing ?
When will dinner be ready ?
Mary pretended she was my sister .
Tom almost never gets to school on time .
You &apos;ve run out of things to drink .
Please have a seat here .
I hear that his father is abroad .
Do I have to go right now ?
Tom is as old as Mary .
Tom was alone in his room .
Could you bring me something to eat ?
Tom saw that Mary was still asleep .
Tom couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Why do people like golf ?
I think Tom and Mary like each other .
You &apos;re fired .
You never can tell what will happen in the future .
I know that he knows .
Tom asked me to speak to you .
If Tom comes , please tell me .
Tom &apos;s mother told him a story .
Tom has many things he has to do today .
Tom knows that we know .
What was Tom &apos;s plan ?
I want to study history .
You should not talk here .
You know who they are .
Tom and Mary have been playing tennis all day .
We can &apos;t thank you enough .
Why is Tom doing that ?
You can &apos;t be thirty years old .
I &apos;ve got an idea .
Tom will meet Mary somewhere in Boston .
If he makes that face it &apos;s because he &apos;s nervous .
If you need any money , I &apos;ll lend you some .
He decided not to go to the meeting .
You know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
We &apos;re students .
A lot has happened .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary will do that again .
Is that what you want , Tom ?
Tom is the only one who can help you now .
Tom will never know .
There is no other explanation .
That is what I have wanted to buy .
Tom is in his room now .
He was happy at the news of her success .
Would you please not smoke here ?
I go straight home after work .
I wonder whether Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday .
The book &apos;s white .
She has gone abroad .
I &apos;ve been told to help you .
You aren &apos;t busy , are you ?
I haven &apos;t played tennis in years .
I &apos;m the same age as Tom is .
I feel my age .
Tom said he wanted to go to Boston .
The only way is up .
We &apos;ll look after you .
I need 30 minutes .
I may do that .
Give me your hand .
He entered through the window .
The food was better in prison .
They &apos;re happy .
He is very honest .
I never want to see you get in trouble .
Do it the way I told you to .
Someone stole Tom &apos;s money .
Tom was sad .
Tom needed someone to help him .
She asked me a question .
Tom may not come .
I got here as soon as I could .
Tom called .
Tom says he &apos;s willing to do just about anything for me .
Tom wondered why Mary wasn &apos;t as busy as everybody else .
Tom thought no one was at home .
She went to the movies by herself .
I know it was you .
His daughter , as well as his son , were famous .
She is a bit like her mother .
His family did not have much money .
I didn &apos;t have to say it twice .
You should &apos;ve come yesterday .
That sounds funny to me .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was afraid .
I &apos;d love to do it .
Tom left as soon as he had the chance .
I don &apos;t have a choice .
If only I &apos;d hadn &apos;t stayed so long !
It looks like I got here too early .
It is easy to play tennis .
There &apos;s a hair in my soup .
You were supposed to be helping Tom , you know .
I &apos;d like to see that .
Tom asked Mary what she had been doing all morning .
She was surprised that it was that late .
He sat down to read a story .
Why does love make us so happy ?
Go ask your father .
I wondered why Tom didn &apos;t have a girlfriend .
Why is it here ?
My sister is three years old .
Get enough sleep .
I must apologize to Tom .
What are you doing in here ?
This tie goes with your shirt .
Has Tom studied French ?
What if Tom is right ?
I &apos;m busy here .
My grandmother is very old .
I know where they are .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be here long .
The police are looking for Tom .
I should &apos;ve never walked so much in a new pair of shoes .
Tom &apos;s innocent .
Tom gave some milk to the cat .
I want to do something with my life .
&quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a key . &quot;
It &apos;s all right .
You don &apos;t have to be afraid .
What do you guys think of Tom ?
Did you call me ?
Tom couldn &apos;t make out what was written on the piece of paper .
We &apos;re very happy for you .
I studied English when I was there .
He is pleased with his new car .
Try again .
Where else in Boston do you want to go ?
There &apos;s something I need to tell you before you leave .
How old is your dog ?
What &apos;s that look like to you ?
I don &apos;t like this .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all the questions .
I don &apos;t care who Tom goes to Boston with .
I have no idea why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom could be alone .
Is Tom happy about this ?
Tom didn &apos;t wait .
Do you think that fish can hear ?
Ask him when the next plane will be .
How can I become rich ?
This is on you .
He will never make it .
I told her once and for all that I wouldn &apos;t go shopping with her .
I &apos;d like to stay for one night .
Tom now knows what he has to do .
Keep it simple , Tom .
I want to forget her .
Please come inside .
Tom should probably do that soon .
Tom told Mary that he had feelings for her .
There is hope .
I &apos;ve got to run to the bank .
Do all of you speak French ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that .
I need to know where you are .
Come with us .
Did you speak with Tom ?
Please make me a cup of coffee .
What do you think of this plan ?
They don &apos;t need to do it right away .
Who told Tom about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like eating .
We just need money to do it .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour .
I heard the news by chance .
Tom &apos;s fat .
Why do you say that ?
It wasn &apos;t that hard .
My uncle lives next to the school .
He &apos;s really good looking .
Tom will be back home soon .
My name is Tom , and this is Mary .
Tom likes playing soccer .
May I take a rest ?
Do you believe in life after death ?
Tom didn &apos;t need to take a taxi . He could have walked .
Tom just waited .
Please have a seat .
Many people were killed in the war .
It was all for nothing .
I want something to eat .
I go to school by bicycle even when it &apos;s raining .
I believe you can help us .
I &apos;m getting tired .
I barely know Tom at all .
Why did you decide to study French ?
These dogs are big .
He is busy writing a letter .
Is this your book ?
I want to buy something to eat .
This isn &apos;t new .
I &apos;m not a kid anymore .
She gave him all the money that she had then .
We need more .
It &apos;ll be forgotten in a few months &apos; time .
Tom showed Mary his garden .
She speaks good English .
I bought you a present .
You love Christmas , don &apos;t you ?
Tom fell into the river .
She made fun of her husband .
How far away is the airport ?
Tom &apos;s my friend .
Tom is worried about me .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t know how that could happen .
I wonder whether Tom likes Mary .
Tom never takes me out for dinner .
Have you ever heard Tom speak French ?
I want to have nothing to do with you .
Where do you have to do that ?
When was the last time you saw Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t planning to stay .
I want these people out of here .
It makes perfect sense .
I &apos;d never played that game before .
An idea came to me .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
You &apos;re not going to like it .
Both Tom and Mary don &apos;t like John .
The bank is closed on Sunday .
It was a mistake on their part .
You have to find Tom .
Give me your address .
It was stupid .
Tom wants to borrow money from me again .
Tom thought about it and agreed that Mary was right .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom again .
I don &apos;t want to eat this .
Tom asked Mary for help .
Tom was a little disappointed .
I wish I could write as well as Tom .
Let me pay for the dinner .
Whose dog is playing with Tom ?
Tom has very little money .
You should look after the children from time to time .
Who wants to wash my car ?
You must do it even if you don &apos;t want to .
It will be dark soon .
I &apos;m able to read French .
I wonder why everybody left so early .
What do you think this is for ?
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else .
I helped her with her work .
All of the students at school know me .
I can &apos;t swim .
I &apos;ve already told Tom what needs to be done .
Does anybody have a pencil ?
Tom likes soccer .
I can no longer stand this noise .
It &apos;s not OK to smoke here .
Don &apos;t say such a thing .
Everybody knows I hate Tom .
Tom always talks as if he knows everything .
She probably knows .
We all make mistakes , don &apos;t we ?
I wrote a song for you .
That &apos;s not the right word .
I drank milk .
She &apos;s sitting on the bench .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary again .
Tom and Mary are waiting for John and Alice .
I don &apos;t know where we &apos;ll arrive .
Tom is likely to forget his promise .
It wasn &apos;t my wife on the phone .
I received a letter from her .
I am talking to my sister .
Tom is your son , not mine .
He asked her where she lived .
Tom stayed home all day .
Who &apos;s that ?
What time will you get to the station ?
Tom won &apos;t let me anywhere near Mary .
Nobody &apos;s perfect .
Why are you really here ?
Tom is not to blame .
Tom says he likes it .
I should never have listened to you .
Tom ate the apple .
They don &apos;t want us .
It is impossible to do it .
He was small , but strong .
I like their house .
Tom and Mary have decided not to come .
What does this have to do with us ?
Aren &apos;t you happy ?
I have a gift for you .
It was easy for me to do so .
She asked me if I was all right .
It &apos;s way too cold to swim .
Tom left the house .
I went to college with Tom .
You always say that .
You &apos;re the best man for the job .
Tom has been looking all over for you .
Do you have any good news ?
Tom is going to be very good .
I met Tom today .
I &apos;m going to turn in early tonight .
We don &apos;t have tea .
It &apos;s up to you and me .
I forgot to ask Tom for his advice .
That &apos;s what I say .
That doesn &apos;t surprise me .
She looked at me and laughed .
Tom didn &apos;t learn how to do that until he was thirty .
There is no chair in this room .
I don &apos;t think Tom will like this place .
I put on my shirt .
This is my new guitar .
Perhaps that &apos;s true .
We are afraid .
When Tom met Mary he knew he &apos;d met the love of his life .
I &apos;ll be coming home .
We &apos;ll meet again .
I never said it was going to be easy .
Tom isn &apos;t well .
Tom and Mary need help .
What were Tom and Mary thinking ?
Would you like some coffee ?
Tom is listening .
I &apos;m sorry , but your names aren &apos;t on the list .
She cannot have done such a thing .
May I ask you a favor ?
What do you really want to do ?
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t much help .
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home .
I have already written a letter .
I sent you a letter .
Leave my family alone .
Tom thinks I &apos;m in love with Mary .
I came to tell you not to worry .
How do you know Tom ?
This is the problem .
You need to stay awake .
He has a large family .
I won &apos;t forget what you did .
We have until tomorrow morning .
Please pass me the salt .
I love this company .
I wonder why Tom bought that .
Tom became famous .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll ever see Tom again .
Tom hates shopping with Mary .
There was absolutely nothing you could do about it .
She might come .
A lot of children don &apos;t hear the difference very well .
No one speaks with me .
My mother was usually very busy .
Do you have everything ?
Do you know where Tom is now ?
Tom wrote the report .
Tom never would &apos;ve said that .
She has been studying French for a few years .
You guys are always so busy .
Can &apos;t you work any faster than that ?
I &apos;ll let Tom know you called .
Tom usually doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
He had no hat on .
Tom called me a taxi .
What does that have to do with you ?
I don &apos;t want your money .
Tom wrote this report by himself .
Is there anything I can do for you ?
Children need a lot of sleep .
You don &apos;t need to tell Tom everything .
What are your plans for tonight ?
We didn &apos;t do it for Tom .
It &apos;ll be difficult to do that .
There were many students in the room .
The book is too expensive .
Not everyone who lives here is rich .
She &apos;s two years older than you .
Tom seems to like the same kind of music as Mary .
It &apos;s almost time .
These clothes suit you .
I only know him by name .
I don &apos;t know how to translate this word .
I was just being honest .
No one takes me seriously .
I think no one knows .
How are things between you two now ?
What do they want from us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t drink coffee .
We &apos;ll never do it again .
I can &apos;t leave yet . I still have a few things to do .
She got no answer from him .
Tom may not be able to come .
What I want isn &apos;t tea , but coffee .
I miss Boston .
If he has time , he will come .
I can &apos;t sleep .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
I set my watch ahead one hour .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel tired .
Tom made his parents happy .
Don &apos;t ask Tom . He doesn &apos;t know anything .
I must go now .
He didn &apos;t listen to music .
The question is how much .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see Mary .
Tom asked Mary how she was doing .
You must do the work even if you don &apos;t like it .
There is no need for him to work .
What &apos;s Tom got ?
I &apos;d like you to help Tom .
Can we please leave now ?
What does Tom know ?
Is this about Tom ?
The bus hasn &apos;t come yet .
I was at a friend &apos;s house .
He &apos;s sleeping like a baby .
Tom would &apos;ve turned thirty next month if he hadn &apos;t died in the accident .
It &apos;s pretty cold .
I didn &apos;t buy everything that Tom asked me to buy .
Tom was already doing that when I got here .
I &apos;m not used to losing .
Tom visited us yesterday .
What &apos;s Tom doing ?
I saw Tom yesterday in a restaurant . He was talking to a girl .
Why don &apos;t you want me to tell anyone ?
I &apos;ll be back at six .
Tom told me Mary &apos;s secret .
Everybody &apos;s happy .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like each other .
This is Tom &apos;s book .
Tom sounds upset .
No one knows whether he loves her or not .
He slept all day .
What was stolen ?
What are your names ?
Please give me a little more time .
I &apos;m trying to understand it .
Here comes a bus . We might as well take it .
Tom hardly ever works anymore .
When did you go ?
Would your name be Tom , by any chance ?
I like her very much .
I can die happy now .
Tom lives there .
I don &apos;t want to sleep .
Why were you absent yesterday ?
Tom could write his name when he was three .
Tom went first .
I played tennis after school .
He has a cold now .
Tom is pretty good at everything .
Tom and I often play tennis together .
Do you mind their coming too ?
You won &apos;t be able to help us .
I thought it was really good .
I tried to convince Tom .
Tom and Mary are waiting with John .
Tom is going to do that for us .
Tom and Mary are the best friends I &apos;ve ever had .
Are you up for that ?
How much should they get ?
It wasn &apos;t an accident .
Tom put a cup of coffee on the table in front of Mary .
I decided to be a lawyer .
What &apos;s your name ?
Nobody called .
I think that would be fine .
Tom became calm .
Tom is in his room .
I have a present for you .
Yesterday , Tom told me he couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom broke that .
I can &apos;t believe you actually did that .
You went to the park yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
Children should go to school .
I was surprised to see an old friend of mine there .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember Mary .
What &apos;ll Tom think ?
I will buy a car .
I wonder if he &apos;s at home .
He told him to study .
How do you like it ?
Tom sent for a doctor .
I think Tom is likely to be very hungry by the time he gets home tonight .
I &apos;ve known Tom for more than thirty years .
Are they Tom &apos;s brothers ?
I &apos;m never going to love you .
I know why Tom &apos;s happy .
Could you show me the way to the train station ?
I need to know .
I wish she could have come .
We don &apos;t have time to do everything they &apos;ve asked us to do .
Tom has problems .
I know that most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
Could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
Everybody in the village knew him .
I didn &apos;t feel like talking to Tom .
I &apos;ll do it with you .
Will you have some more tea ?
I &apos;m really busy at the moment .
I &apos;m all for that .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know how to do it .
What time is it now in Boston ?
I surprised Tom .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t always right .
Who am I talking to ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary at all .
What else could we expect ?
Tom said good night to Mary and left .
When will you leave ?
Give this to Tom .
I &apos;m not too late , am I ?
What do they want with Tom ?
She has been to Paris .
His wife opened the door for him .
The price of rice has come down .
I believe that the boy is honest .
Many people were late for the concert .
He seems to know nothing about the matter .
Tom wasn &apos;t stupid enough to tell Mary what he really thought .
Here &apos;s what I don &apos;t understand .
You and I are both students at this school .
He was kind enough to show me the way to the library .
It &apos;s late . I have to go .
Tell me how to solve the problem .
No one takes Tom seriously .
I went home .
Tom is in the kitchen .
I &apos;m glad I was there .
There &apos;s a little bit of water in the glass .
You need to go there yourself .
Let Tom stay .
I have a big family .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s already time to go home .
I &apos;ll take those .
You know I didn &apos;t mean it .
The movie was good .
What do you have in your hand ?
I want you to leave us alone .
The milk has gone bad .
Tom &apos;s family is rich .
What are the rules ?
Do you want to be here ?
You are a friend of Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
How big is your house ?
I have to take it .
I don &apos;t know why I just did that .
I still have to do that .
Tom started studying French three years ago .
We played tennis yesterday .
Please don &apos;t open the window .
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak a word of French .
I brought something for you .
Do you have some money ?
He has three brothers .
What does this have to do with Tom ?
It looks like Tom is disappointed .
Tom isn &apos;t the only one who thinks that way .
I &apos;m certain Tom will want to speak with you .
Where does he want to go ?
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
Can I see this one ?
What good are those ?
The radio is out of order .
Why did Tom do it ?
I believe in Tom .
I lost .
How come you don &apos;t like me anymore ?
What I need is a beer .
That &apos;s what we think .
Why are we going to Boston ?
Don &apos;t look at me .
I fell in love .
Are you buying into this ?
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do today .
Tom worked very hard today .
Nobody does it better .
I didn &apos;t pay .
I bought a lot of things .
They weren &apos;t invited .
The only one here who &apos;s able to do that is Tom .
What are you planning to do ?
I really don &apos;t feel good .
She wrote a new book .
The meeting was held here .
Tom gave Mary a drink .
I became very ill .
Your grandmother meant a lot to you , didn &apos;t she ?
You didn &apos;t actually see anything , did you ?
We tried our best .
Tom won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
I visited the village he was born in .
Tom died yesterday .
Tom spoke slowly .
I &apos;ll phone you .
When I &apos;ve finished my homework , I &apos;ll go for a swim .
Stop being so nice .
The teacher can &apos;t have said such a thing .
How old was Tom in this picture ?
Tom knew where to go .
He couldn &apos;t bear the thought of leaving her .
I don &apos;t believe the child came to Tokyo alone .
Tom did that a lot .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know what to do .
I hope you know that , Tom .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late .
I haven &apos;t forgotten .
Have you ever seen Tom &apos;s mother ?
Nobody knows where he lives .
Why didn &apos;t the bus stop ?
You have something on your face .
What have I missed ?
I think you &apos;re interesting .
He loves her .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell us ?
What else do I need to do ?
Tom &apos;s still a kid .
It has been six years since I started to study English .
That &apos;ll just have to wait until next week .
My brother didn &apos;t like her from the start .
You must start at once .
Tom and Mary rarely go out .
Tom &apos;s not here .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s a good idea .
I can &apos;t find Tom . Has he gone already ?
I am here .
Where do you know him from ?
We can &apos;t just act as if nothing has happened .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend and Tom doesn &apos;t either .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that right away .
We &apos;ll bring Tom .
It &apos;s not enough .
Tom didn &apos;t have to go to work today .
Tom might be taller than you .
My French isn &apos;t very good .
He often plays guitar .
I must tell you something .
I &apos;ll be back .
Tom told me that I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary is .
Tom is in Boston .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come here .
We &apos;ve known each other for over thirty years .
That &apos;s really not necessary .
Tom must be over thirty by now .
I got up early yesterday .
I &apos;d never seen anything like that before .
It &apos;s been three years since Tom left Boston .
Tom hasn &apos;t used it for over a year .
She gave him some money .
Do you know that guy &apos;s name ?
Tom isn &apos;t a bad person .
Tom is a good student , isn &apos;t he ?
She had to take care of her sister .
Tom got into bed .
I don &apos;t think his story is true .
I have some bad news for you .
Here is your bill .
Can I have a glass of water , please ?
He has three children .
Tom , will you stop that ?
I &apos;m bad at tennis .
Tom helped Mary to her feet .
That &apos;s exactly what Tom told me .
You don &apos;t look like Tom .
I can &apos;t help but feel like I &apos;ve forgotten something .
He knows how to tell jokes .
I heard the door open .
He is not there .
Tom came alone .
I often go swimming in the river .
Tom says what he thinks .
I had one last hope .
You should &apos;ve known better .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
This clock is mine .
Was Tom working alone ?
We &apos;re not doing anything .
Here he is !
What have you decided ?
Make way , please .
This is the best book I have ever read .
I received a letter in French last week .
I don &apos;t have a cat , but Tom does .
This is the fish he caught .
I came here as fast as I could .
Who does Tom want to go to Boston with ?
We must help each other .
I don &apos;t think you should quit your job .
We are against war .
Tom has to be careful about what he eats .
We want to get out of here .
I don &apos;t know why Tom went to Boston .
She went there to swim .
I didn &apos;t really understand that .
My birthday &apos;s not for another month .
I think I &apos;ll be able to fix it .
Tom has been drinking a lot of coffee .
I &apos;m just as old as Tom is .
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
He called for help .
Did you buy anything to eat ?
I didn &apos;t know that would happen .
Would you like to play tennis on Sunday ?
I guess I have to trust you .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with you .
Tom hasn &apos;t written to me in a long time .
Tom was disappointed at not being invited .
I almost never watch TV .
She came home very late .
Tom is doing that again .
I knew Tom .
Tom is proud of his car .
I wrote down her phone number .
I met a friend .
I &apos;ve been to Boston a couple of times .
Try it out yourself .
How many more days will it take Tom to finish doing that ?
Everyone &apos;s doing it .
Tom got scared .
Tom went there to meet Mary .
You can sleep on the couch .
It was just something I read in a newspaper .
Tom wanted to name his son John .
They &apos;ll understand .
Would you like meat or fish ?
If Tom can do it , I &apos;m sure I can do it , too .
I can come at three .
We were all worried .
Mary made the kids breakfast .
I can win .
I &apos;d like to apologize for this morning .
Tom is going to enjoy this .
Tom studied French for many years .
I have just a few questions .
This sentence is not in English .
What do you think of it ?
We lost sight of each other .
I only need two more minutes .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a horse .
I had my money stolen somewhere .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
Who &apos;d believe you anyway ?
Tom will save us .
He is not rich , but he is happy .
We really have to go .
Tom thought nobody was at home .
Are you sure that you know me ?
I promised your father I &apos;d look after you .
May I leave this book with you ?
Just get to work .
He doesn &apos;t listen .
My father fell ill because he worked too hard .
Tom quickly closed the door .
He has gone mad .
Tom wants to be finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
I can &apos;t leave work until five .
It &apos;s up to you , Tom .
He &apos;s looking for a job .
I can &apos;t tell you how much I appreciate that .
He went out of the room .
What is it that Tom wants ?
I don &apos;t want Tom to find me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with John .
Tom is afraid of cats .
Are you happy now , Tom ?
I &apos;ll give you what you want .
Let &apos;s get down to business .
You may go home now if you like .
I am at home every evening .
I don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
I &apos;ll be taking the car .
It was yesterday that I saw him .
I got a lot to say .
Tom looks like he &apos;s hot .
You don &apos;t want that , do you ?
You &apos;re better off without me .
The people in Boston are great .
It &apos;s not a fish .
What do you think happened here ?
Why does everyone need to learn English ?
We &apos;re sorry .
When did you buy it ?
You don &apos;t have to study .
We almost didn &apos;t get there on time .
I have a high opinion of this book .
What country are you from ?
You can &apos;t stop me .
I have no books to read .
You &apos;ve gotten better .
My brother is good at playing tennis .
They &apos;re good people .
Tom has been a teacher for thirty years .
He has to make a speech at the party .
I want Tom to have this .
I &apos;ve got everything I want .
Tom and Mary were very quiet in the car .
We &apos;ve got to get out of here .
He gave up .
Are you going to write to your father ?
Tom isn &apos;t convinced .
Tom wore a hat .
Tom used to live in Boston .
Tom thought Mary was in the room .
I didn &apos;t meet anyone there .
We sometimes see them .
No one believes what Tom says anymore .
Tom said he wanted to kill himself .
She didn &apos;t feel like eating lunch .
I am not a teacher .
Tom knows that &apos;s no good .
I didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
Tom never seems to have much to say .
I only have a few hours .
They won &apos;t tell us anything .
You only have to work hard .
I love him .
Tom is the right man for the job .
You &apos;re famous .
You guys need each other .
They &apos;re waiting for an answer .
You make hardly any mistakes .
My father made my mother a cup of coffee just the way she likes it .
I &apos;ve done that once already .
Tom bought this camera for himself , not for his wife .
I &apos;m leaving now .
I would like to buy a sofa .
I think that Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;m not looking forward to seeing Tom .
Tom is the love of my life .
Mary and Alice are Tom &apos;s sisters .
Is this OK with you ?
Tom asked Mary to stay where she was .
Tom , answer the door .
Tom and Mary will probably get married one day .
Tom likes sitting on the beach in the early morning .
Tom can &apos;t see you .
It still doesn &apos;t work .
Children should play outside .
I said go home .
I hid myself under the bed .
Tom &apos;s so old .
It &apos;s impossible to fix .
I don &apos;t remember her name anymore .
Tom and Mary seem to like each other .
I said I &apos;d be there .
I know that Tom is honest .
He dressed like a girl .
I didn &apos;t have a job .
I think you know what I think .
We &apos;re running out of time .
You have to live here .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; place .
I will wait here till he comes .
He hasn &apos;t been able to come because he is sick .
I &apos;m happy with it .
I know the situation is very difficult for us .
I &apos;ll go with you as far as the bridge .
What &apos;s your cat &apos;s name ?
How long is it ?
He is always with me .
Tom helped again .
This is a long list .
We &apos;ve never done it before .
I knew it was a bad idea .
I will help you .
We may have a problem .
I slept all day .
I don &apos;t go out much .
He never saw his father again .
He was sitting on a bench .
What else did you say ?
I have already eaten lunch .
It &apos;s not up to me .
I made a lot of mistakes .
Your cake is delicious .
Why don &apos;t you have a seat ?
Tom isn &apos;t honest .
He kept his promise .
I think you can do better than that .
It is what I would do .
I &apos;m older than you . You have to listen to me .
It &apos;s time for you to go to bed .
He has more books than he can read .
I can see the light .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
I wonder how long it &apos;s going to take .
She fell from the tree .
I have three times as much money as you .
Do you want to know the future ?
&quot; Is it OK if I don &apos;t do that ? &quot; &quot; No , you have to do that . &quot;
Tom didn &apos;t give you much choice .
Tom was quite young at the time .
Tom got a letter from Mary today .
I can &apos;t eat .
Tom likes to drink .
Tom is a lot better at it than I am .
Tom very seldom goes anywhere anymore .
Tell me where Tom lives .
Why are you doing this for us ?
Some people are never satisfied with what they have .
This is for you , Tom .
Tom went swimming with us yesterday .
Don &apos;t act like you &apos;re so innocent .
Let &apos;s hurry up .
If you have a problem with that , talk to the boss .
I &apos;ve got enough money for a car .
Tom can &apos;t come , because he &apos;s sick .
You &apos;ve won !
Where &apos;s your brother ?
You won &apos;t tell Tom , will you ?
Are you going to study French ?
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
May I eat a little of it ?
How did you do that without our help ?
Tom is doing a fine job .
Tom was sitting at his desk .
I do that at least once a day .
I will be at home tomorrow .
Why are we doing this ?
The train hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
What &apos;s Tom going to think ?
Why are they laughing ?
She was hurt in the accident .
What &apos;s it going to be ?
Tom likes Mary , but Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
I really don &apos;t care what Tom thinks .
Tom will be here any moment .
Tom isn &apos;t a big man .
He looks like his mother .
I can &apos;t believe anything Tom says anymore .
I was in Australia last week .
He talks as though he knew everything .
We don &apos;t want that anymore .
I can &apos;t go back to that house .
I think we need more time .
I &apos;ll do that for sure .
Did Tom win again ?
I had no idea we had so much in common .
All the students look up to him .
Where &apos;s my watch ?
This work is difficult for us .
He has been busy since this morning .
There used to be a prison here .
Tom has never heard Mary sing .
We love our school .
I guess it &apos;s time to leave .
Tom is used to living alone .
I want to travel around the world .
Tom must have been at home at that time .
Tom is drinking tea , isn &apos;t he ?
He left the house at eight o &apos;clock .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
Tom is mad .
I had a wonderful time .
I &apos;ve found it .
We &apos;re always very careful .
What &apos;s up with you today ?
We couldn &apos;t stop .
Tom could find Mary &apos;s house easily .
I work as a teacher .
Tell Tom to be quiet .
Why are you speaking French to Tom ?
Tom looks asleep .
I think Tom is here already .
Have you had dinner ?
I &apos;ll be back in an hour or so .
Were you tired last night ?
Bring Tom along .
I noticed that she was wearing new glasses .
Don &apos;t get so excited !
Tom is in a very good mood today .
Where did you buy this guitar ?
This is the most fun I &apos;ve had in my life .
Tom wanted to know why it would take three hours .
What are you people doing ?
Tom isn &apos;t speaking to me anymore .
Tom is too good for Mary .
He began to sing .
Tom is used to talking to children .
Tom and I sometimes work together .
You cannot do this .
He has a hat on .
I &apos;ll take care of this dog .
I went to church this morning .
I have to tell you the truth .
Aren &apos;t we friends ?
Tom didn &apos;t think so .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to college .
Do I have to make a speech ?
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom right now .
That can &apos;t be the good news .
If you guys want to sleep here , it &apos;s no problem .
I &apos;m very tired now .
I &apos;m glad I was able to meet you yesterday .
We need to go .
Tom got angry with us .
I was serious .
Do you know where it is ?
I think Tom would tell the truth .
Tom met Mary by chance on his way home from school .
Tom had a cold .
He is a good doctor .
I &apos;m feeling a little nervous right now .
I just came from my house .
I &apos;m not alone .
I can &apos;t quite understand .
There &apos;s nobody here by that name .
Did you buy the medicine ?
It &apos;s not my car .
I am friends with her .
Tom ate nothing .
I didn &apos;t tell him everything .
I &apos;d like to spend more time with my family .
I &apos;ve told you everything I know about Tom .
What did you think when you actually met me for the first time ?
She was able to solve the problem in ten minutes .
She lives near the beach .
Give me your book .
He asked a very good question .
Tom needs to answer the question .
We still have to do that .
I hope to see my parents tomorrow .
Do you think Tom was hungry ?
Tom told everyone that he was afraid to do that .
I read your book .
I didn &apos;t see you coming .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you since two o &apos;clock .
We &apos;ll see you again .
I &apos;m reading a book .
I can handle it .
Did you enjoy the movie ?
Could you say that again ?
We &apos;re going to miss Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised that Mary was there .
I did exactly what I said I would do .
You almost missed me .
There &apos;s something I need to show you .
Did you wait for Tom ?
Where &apos;s Tom when you need him ?
What would you say to convince him to buy one ?
We left together .
I learned it from you .
Tom likes living in Boston .
Tom said he &apos;d come tomorrow .
Tom very seldom does that anymore .
What do you want to study ?
The work was very difficult .
That &apos;s too good to be true .
I never got an answer from Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go to Australia next week .
Please don &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m living my dream .
Tom rarely ever does that anymore .
I had fun .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed a little longer .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
Where did you buy the flowers ?
Tom is too stupid to be scared .
He got to school just in time .
Would you like to have another cup of tea ?
Yesterday was Sunday .
Tom hasn &apos;t come yet .
Tom is used to doing his own cooking .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only person who couldn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;ve heard that Tom can cook as well as , or better than , his wife .
She stopped to smoke .
I ran out of money .
How long have you been in here ?
Tom &apos;s Canadian .
I want you to go to Boston .
Tom said that he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
I wish I could understand French .
I &apos;m very happy in Boston .
What did you do to my computer ?
I &apos;m the one who told Tom about your party .
Do you have kids ?
The lake is very deep .
It doesn &apos;t matter what he said .
You &apos;re not invited to lunch .
I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
You could have been happy .
Tom has no one to help him .
Why are people afraid of you ?
Everybody likes Tom .
When does Tom have to do that ?
I don &apos;t know when she got married .
Tom locked the door .
I &apos;ll get my car .
Why do you always wear that hat ?
I &apos;ve only used it once .
I like China .
Will you use this ?
I &apos;ll talk to Tom .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever heard that joke before .
I told Tom I couldn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;d like to be young again .
Tom is quiet now .
Can I really have it at this price ?
I &apos;m so hungry that I could eat a horse .
It looks good .
Tom didn &apos;t get very far .
I think Tom is dangerous .
If I had known about it , I would have told you .
I think it &apos;s too cold to swim .
I have to give it to Tom .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go with us ?
You &apos;re not as tall as I am .
Tom seems tired tonight .
We can &apos;t just let Tom leave .
He may change his mind later .
Can we just go home ?
So long .
Tom wants to see you in his office .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the right to say that .
She doesn &apos;t like soccer .
Tom can &apos;t cook well .
You know what it is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom seemed fine .
What advice can you give me ?
Are you sure you want to do this by yourself ?
It isn &apos;t Tom .
She doesn &apos;t like going to school .
The old clock is still in use .
Tom &apos;s name was on the box .
Tom saw Mary in her car .
We &apos;re on our own .
Give it up , Tom .
It &apos;s so nice to be back .
We &apos;re very good friends .
Today wasn &apos;t a good day .
I &apos;m not going to be very happy .
I would like to live in France .
That was hard to believe .
What you did made Tom happy .
We &apos;ll take Tom with us .
No one wants to go there .
I remember it like it happened yesterday .
I &apos;ve had a busy day .
I just have one question for you .
I arrived in London .
Tom has already eaten .
Tom was in the hospital .
Would you leave us alone , please ?
I can &apos;t remember anything .
What are they ?
We &apos;re certain .
I am having a look at it .
That didn &apos;t used to happen .
Don &apos;t leave , Tom .
I think my suitcase was stolen .
I got you something .
Tom , are you in there ?
Let &apos;s do it another time .
Thanks for meeting me .
Tom doesn &apos;t get along with his sisters .
Tom knows some French .
Why are you doing that ?
Tom is sad .
I &apos;ve never studied French .
Tom loves doing this .
I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not what you want to do .
It &apos;s almost dark .
I can &apos;t remember anymore .
Tom has gone to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t like driving in Boston .
There is nothing going on between Tom and me .
He got into bed .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m not like that .
I think it would be fun .
He arrived very early this morning .
This is the train for New York .
When will you get married ?
I think that Tom knows Mary .
Have him come .
Tom should &apos;ve called .
The school needed a new teacher .
Her family is very large .
What are you so nervous about ?
I &apos;m not good with kids .
They went outside .
We &apos;ve got less than three minutes .
She &apos;ll be having dinner with him at this time tomorrow .
Take us with you .
I just don &apos;t feel like going to school today .
Have you called the boss already ?
Nobody knows the future .
Tom said that &apos;s no problem .
Tom can cook .
Tom had to pay a few more dollars .
Tom says you can fix anything .
She really needs your help .
I wonder if this milk is still good .
This is my decision .
I &apos;d like to drink some tea or coffee .
Please make sure that the dog doesn &apos;t go outside .
I have to see this .
Why are we running ?
I can &apos;t think of any solution to this problem .
I &apos;m very rich .
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday .
What &apos;ll it be like ?
It &apos;s your money , isn &apos;t it ?
No one asked your opinion .
Everybody saw it .
Where are the eggs , please ?
The boy has a newspaper .
It was too difficult for me .
I came here yesterday .
I don &apos;t care what Tom says .
English is not easy for us .
I speak French every day .
Nothing happened .
I know just what you need .
He stayed there for three days .
I had no idea you were here .
I keep a dog .
Tom began talking .
Is she at home ?
I know exactly what I have to do .
It &apos;s the correct answer .
I &apos;ve never done that before .
Have you told him yet ?
I told you so .
I would like to meet his father .
I &apos;ll show you around the town .
Where &apos;s your family ?
He came home exactly at ten .
Mary and Alice are sisters .
Tom is happy here .
Tom hates speaking French .
I &apos;d like to think that there &apos;s more to it than that .
Why are we walking ?
You can &apos;t just leave .
There is nothing that can &apos;t be bought with money .
I won &apos;t leave without you .
Let &apos;s leave her alone .
Do come and visit us .
How long will you stay in Japan ?
They haven &apos;t learned anything .
You don &apos;t need to do that right away .
Tom walked out of the movie .
He has more books than he can ever read .
I don &apos;t mind sleeping on the floor .
We had no idea what we should do .
Everything is fine .
Most people like pizza .
He would give you the shirt off his back .
You never stop , do you ?
I won &apos;t be back for a while .
Can you tell me what day it is today ?
No one told me .
He has to stay in bed .
He found my bicycle .
Tom wanted to become a policeman .
It looks like Tom is having fun .
It was dark by the time I got home .
Tom told me not to talk to you .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with Tom ?
The kitchen of this house is very large .
Tom should be at home .
I no longer live in Boston .
Are we going home ?
This is the last train .
Can we not talk about this just now ?
I know what Tom is like .
It &apos;s not at all easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like anybody here .
This umbrella looks like mine .
I am going to study .
A car went by .
I told them they shouldn &apos;t move .
I can &apos;t drive .
Tom promised me he would come early .
I think it &apos;s time for us to leave .
How did Tom die ?
Tom felt tired .
I need to talk with Tom .
I &apos;m not as heavy as Tom .
Tom hardly ever talks to Mary .
I want someone to tell me why Tom isn &apos;t here today .
I want to know what &apos;s in this box .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not that simple .
You may not be right .
I got one for you , too .
I had trouble getting a taxi .
I &apos;ve tried .
I &apos;m thinking of going .
I can drive a car .
Tom is learning very quickly .
I &apos;ve learned a lot from Tom .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want a girlfriend .
It &apos;s not worth the money .
I &apos;ve got to help Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
It &apos;s getting late , so we &apos;d better get going .
I would like to travel alone .
I &apos;d like to change my room .
There is one big difference .
I don &apos;t know if he would have done it for me .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s home .
I love her and she loves me .
You don &apos;t have to tell that to your parents .
We were worried .
I have to have it .
He asked his friend for advice .
My sister likes Tom .
I can teach you something .
Didn &apos;t you like the movie ?
We caught Tom .
I was very careful on the phone .
How do you think I can convince her to spend more time with me ?
Tom went home .
She used to help him with his homework .
I didn &apos;t pay Tom anything .
It just doesn &apos;t work that way .
If possible , I &apos;d like to see him .
Everybody likes them .
How do you make a box ?
Tom stopped talking when Mary came into the room .
They &apos;re in the car .
Tom is very impressed .
What am I going to do without Tom ?
He can &apos;t sing well .
It &apos;s all in the room .
I think they saw us .
Everyone can &apos;t afford a car .
What was it that you gave him ?
Tom usually eats alone .
Have you made plans for next weekend ?
Tom is her brother .
I think Tom injured himself .
Have you ever taken your children to the beach ?
You &apos;re like me .
I &apos;m in a good mood .
I invited all my friends .
I go to the park .
Tom had no idea why Mary wanted to see him .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m Tom &apos;s friend .
I thought Tom was interested .
I saw the doctor .
He has three times as many books as I have .
I have visited Boston three times .
Tell me who you saw .
Tom had no one to help him .
Yesterday I went to the movies .
Tom gave Mary a watch .
I love being alone .
Your family needs you .
I &apos;ve lost my umbrella . I must buy a new one .
Tom was alone at the time .
I heard the good news .
Tom is at his desk , studying French .
I advised Tom not to do that .
He &apos;s often late for work .
Let &apos;s start with beer .
Tom is learning .
He stayed in New York for three weeks .
This is a hospital .
The world isn &apos;t perfect .
My book has to be somewhere in the room .
Tom told me that everything was ready .
Tom looked away .
Tom is alone in the house .
He &apos;s old enough to be your father .
I want you to come home with me .
She looked out of the window .
Where is my ball ?
He was angry and confused .
Tom told me you need help .
Tom knows what Mary did .
You &apos;re fine .
Tom has a driver &apos;s license .
Tom should thank you .
It isn &apos;t a hospital .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that .
Some people think it &apos;s a bad idea .
Aren &apos;t you going to go ?
Tom could &apos;ve been the one .
I &apos;ll come to your place .
Tom could help you .
I have a son who &apos;s just turned three .
I &apos;ll take the next bus .
You should call Tom .
The weather is very bad .
That will not be possible .
Tom isn &apos;t here , is he ?
I want to thank you .
Tom and Mary have two cats .
I &apos;m safe here .
They must have made a mistake .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell Tom .
I feel like dancing .
They are eating their apples .
She advised him to become a teacher .
You could have told me .
What &apos;s in the bottle ?
Have you read this book ?
I &apos;m against the war .
Tom said he wanted to leave .
He may have missed the plane .
I have never read that book .
Where did this happen ?
Tom found it difficult to solve the problem .
This song sounds like one I heard a few minutes ago .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to do that .
Thank you for doing that .
I can &apos;t think of a good reason why we should give Tom any money .
You &apos;re very different from us .
I have to get to school .
I thought Tom would meet Mary .
He has something to do with the matter .
What &apos;s Tom reading ?
This book is really old .
Please don &apos;t say that .
We &apos;ll miss you , too .
He asked us to help him .
Tom made himself a cup of tea .
May I hold your hand ?
There is one thing I don &apos;t understand .
Tom and I have worked together for over three years .
This is good meat .
Tom can explain the situation .
I &apos;m working on the problem .
Tom will return at 2 : 30 .
I heard you broke up with your girlfriend .
Can I ask why this is so important to you ?
I &apos;ve got it .
I &apos;m certain that Tom will pass the exam .
Tom is in college .
He is as healthy as ever .
Please say that once again in French .
What did Tom get ?
We all have a right to be happy .
This has to wait until tomorrow .
Why don &apos;t you go to your room , Tom ?
Tom got out of bed and got dressed .
Tom promised he would be there .
Tom wants to come and see you .
He likes sleeping .
Tom knows what Mary likes .
We were talking about something at that time , but I don &apos;t remember what .
Tom pretended to be Canadian .
We &apos;ll come with you .
Tom told me he had no time to read books .
He saw everything .
Tom hasn &apos;t come home yet .
Tom put his arm around Mary .
When did you finish the work ?
I can &apos;t remember why I was there .
I should do that right away .
We &apos;re not welcome .
He has made up his mind to buy the car .
Are you honest ?
Please feel free to ask questions .
I got married .
Is what you told me secret ?
We have to go to school .
I like what you &apos;re doing .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a month .
This is all our fault .
Tom won &apos;t go away .
Did Tom take last week off ?
How come this never happens to me ?
The work is well worth the trouble .
Don &apos;t be late for school again .
Your parents know where you are .
I have a little money .
She didn &apos;t need to come .
Tom is still in love with you .
That &apos;s the problem we have to solve .
Is she gone ?
You don &apos;t know us .
I know what this is about .
We can &apos;t talk now .
Mary helped Tom .
Tom has probably gone for a walk .
Please do something .
You might have to do this all by yourself .
Tom has more books than he can read .
You know what they say about Tom .
I know that it &apos;s there .
What do you think of the book ?
I won &apos;t work with him .
I think you &apos;re cute .
What do you want me to do with this little girl ?
It needs washing .
Tom felt lonely .
I wish it had never happened .
They &apos;re special .
You &apos;ve got my vote .
Tom sat next to Mary on the couch .
That &apos;s not how I see it .
It &apos;s worth the money .
That isn &apos;t what I meant .
Will he be able to catch the train ?
She became very ill .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that because he doesn &apos;t think he needs to .
Get lost !
No one knows .
You &apos;ve already won .
You &apos;re doing it wrong !
I &apos;ll do everything you tell me to do .
He didn &apos;t find what I hid .
The baby needs his mother .
Is all this necessary ?
The store is open .
Get word to Tom .
Are you saying that this is my fault ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
I told you to stay in the car .
Tom eats slowly .
You should be happy for Tom .
I don &apos;t remember where I bought it .
Tom is at least a head taller than me .
I &apos;m not from Boston .
It &apos;s my last offer .
I &apos;m learning French .
All the students are studying English .
You swim very quickly .
Nobody gave us a chance .
I made it .
Thank you all for coming .
We can &apos;t save everybody .
Does Tom do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
I think Tom has never been to Boston .
Give this book to Tom .
How many apples do you have ?
The box is heavy .
Tom said Mary was good at French .
I saw her leaving the room .
I can hear something .
He opened his mouth as if to speak , but didn &apos;t say anything .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
I &apos;m watching the news .
I know you don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom has to go with Mary .
Take what you want .
I &apos;d like some hot tea , please .
I don &apos;t eat meat .
You are a good person .
There isn &apos;t enough soup for everyone .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t smoke so much .
I think we should follow Tom .
I don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen .
I &apos;m not in love with Tom anymore .
Did Tom say anything to you ?
I tried to tell Tom .
He lives from hand to mouth .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much money .
Tom sat down in front of his computer .
I don &apos;t have a phone .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t like children .
Tom bought too much milk .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to talk about work .
We &apos;ll see how it goes .
Why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Can you tell me where I might find Tom ?
I &apos;m looking out for Tom .
He has this large room to himself .
Can I kiss you ?
Aren &apos;t you going to ask ?
Do you know why Tom came here today ?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary ?
There &apos;s nothing I can do to change that .
How many people work there ?
You &apos;re a good boy .
How &apos;s Tom tonight ?
It &apos;s clear that Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I &apos;ll take care of the cat .
Tom is doing fine .
Do you have a girlfriend now ?
I wish we had won the game .
I &apos;ll call Tom and tell him we won &apos;t be coming .
Is this the train station ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to dance .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve seen him before .
I &apos;m not afraid anymore .
I know where to look .
Are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
I was your age once .
Tom said Mary was willing to do that tomorrow .
Can you get something to eat in there ?
The light went out .
He went to school by car .
Where are my parents ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s book .
He knows a lot of people .
What do you make of this ?
The man is right .
Tom knew that something was about to happen .
Tom had no money left .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be interested .
I don &apos;t know how long it &apos;ll take .
Tom is doing that .
What you said convinced Tom .
Who &apos;re you looking for ?
Tom loves flowers .
They &apos;re very , very good .
Tom left his wife and children .
When did you learn how to swim ?
I don &apos;t see why we need to do this .
Tom &apos;s dog is white .
Don &apos;t talk !
I think there &apos;s a mistake on my bill .
Tom is playing piano .
He knows the secret .
You are wanted on the phone .
Tom was really good .
Tom can &apos;t swim at all .
I don &apos;t know what to do anymore .
Tom used to work in Boston .
Tom seems to be happy .
Are you at Tom &apos;s place ?
We &apos;ll talk about that later .
This is good coffee .
That will be funny .
Have you ever written a book ?
I &apos;m right behind him .
Go back outside .
What is wrong with these people ?
Tom ran out of the room .
TV is also not what it used to be .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t mean to be late .
How many years have you studied French ?
Where did it all start ?
Please speak English .
I have seen enough .
I &apos;m not going back .
I was awake .
I have two brothers .
Tom isn &apos;t as busy as he seems to be .
Tom works there .
Where does Tom usually eat lunch ?
Don &apos;t watch TV .
Why doesn &apos;t he tell the truth ?
She looked very beautiful in her new dress .
Those books are mine .
Where can I catch the bus to the station ?
I love to play golf .
Her name is Mary .
Let &apos;s go to a concert together .
How old is your daughter ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to eat anything else .
Tom will never believe that .
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt anyone .
What was I supposed to say ?
I &apos;m really not all that hungry .
The truth is very simple .
I smiled .
What killed Tom ?
We &apos;ll see .
Why aren &apos;t you with your parents ?
Tom didn &apos;t mean to do it .
Yesterday my father caught three fish .
This is the house where I was born .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s decision .
That &apos;s all I know .
If this is your knife , then I have lost mine .
Who is there ?
Tell Tom to come to Boston .
I play tennis after school .
It makes me sad .
Can I go to work ?
When does Tom study ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
I haven &apos;t been sick for the past three years .
Tom knew immediately that something was wrong .
I like you just the way you are .
It &apos;s hot today .
Do you know us ?
I want a cup of tea .
When was the last time you bought shoes ?
Do you want me to come ?
I talked to friends .
This is the last time .
I don &apos;t hate anyone .
I don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
Do you think Tom knows ?
You &apos;re not going to get fired .
Tom should have left earlier .
Tom looks strong .
I &apos;m older than you think I am .
I remember having seen this movie before .
I didn &apos;t expect that question .
I want to stay for a few days .
She stayed at a hotel .
I want to thank you for everything you &apos;ve done .
I &apos;m not sure Tom is willing to help us .
I &apos;m not going to die .
Try to stay awake .
Look what you &apos;ve done .
Tom is good at that .
He &apos;ll be back soon .
I want you to be here .
I would like to go to France .
Do you want to do it again ?
I &apos;ll give these to you .
Tom knew who I was before I told him .
Let &apos;s get together in my office .
Give me the book .
Tom said he didn &apos;t see anything .
The decision has been made .
Tom would &apos;ve liked to stay longer .
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
Take it home .
She is very busy .
I found the book interesting .
Let me carry your suitcase .
The girl didn &apos;t say anything .
Do you like what you see ?
It &apos;s all going to be OK .
I was on the list .
It &apos;s not over yet .
He gave her a box .
Tom didn &apos;t tell the truth .
My hair is too long .
I take it back .
I think you &apos;re right .
You need to help me .
Take things as they are .
Thanks for the flowers .
I &apos;d like to hear a story .
He wrote a book on China .
I &apos;ve been a teacher for two years .
Tom is going to be there , too .
I want to leave early today .
It isn &apos;t going to be easy .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t get along .
It is difficult to speak three languages .
I wish I could do something .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do next .
You &apos;ve got time right now , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m taking it seriously .
What has that got to do with anything ?
Tom brought Mary a gift .
I have everything I want .
I have many friends I can talk to .
We don &apos;t want your money .
Tom pretended to be sick .
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew how to speak French ?
I &apos;m happy that you &apos;re happy .
Tom caught a big fish .
He doesn &apos;t know me .
Tom didn &apos;t even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee .
I think Tom is drunk .
What do I owe you ?
I hardly see you anymore .
Please do not try this at home .
I &apos;ve never been in love before .
We &apos;ll die sooner or later .
What time , exactly , did Tom leave ?
I may know Tom .
We could &apos;ve saved Tom if we &apos;d arrived just a few minutes earlier .
Tom certainly got the message .
I have it with me .
What &apos;s wrong with you today ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s decision .
I don &apos;t have any money and I don &apos;t have any friends either .
We don &apos;t have to go .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French as well as Mary .
I just want to know what happened .
Tom appears to be looking for someone .
I have something to show you .
Get off his back .
That &apos;s not a good thing .
Tom told me to meet him there .
The party won &apos;t start until Tom gets here .
Let me try it .
Tom gave his cat some milk .
Why am I so tired ?
I have less and less time for reading .
Tom brought flowers .
Tom asked Mary a question .
There &apos;s something under the bed .
Tom looks tired this evening .
Tom will probably be home soon .
Tom has no idea where he left his keys .
Did you see anybody there ?
She must have told a lie .
Tom will know where to go .
We &apos;re not all as busy as you are .
Why do we have to go home ?
Don &apos;t show your face around here again .
Maybe I should write a letter to Tom .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really talking to you .
I don &apos;t eat as much meat as I used to .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
Tom has gone for good .
Why didn &apos;t Tom do that ?
May I take a picture of you ?
How did you learn to speak French so well ?
That man was fired last week .
Tom and Mary have nothing in the world except each other .
I have some bad news .
Where &apos;s the boy ?
Tom left the room without saying a word .
Tom has many books .
That &apos;s really interesting .
Tom often doesn &apos;t come to school .
Tom isn &apos;t going to leave us .
I &apos;m not the only one who doesn &apos;t want to be here .
These three books belong to Tom .
Tom told me that Mary died on Monday .
We &apos;re going home by car .
She came home disappointed .
The sky was completely dark .
Can I see you tonight ?
It wasn &apos;t mine .
I thought you told me you couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom is now in jail .
I think Tom has made a mistake .
Did Tom leave ?
What does the bill come to ?
Most people don &apos;t drink enough water .
I told you I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Be proud of yourself .
I &apos;ve never met him .
Tom took off his shirt .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
I do not like the way he talks .
I want to do this at home .
Tom is hurt .
I don &apos;t think we have enough time .
I told Tom to do that .
It &apos;s not too late .
I really need this job .
Come along .
This really isn &apos;t a good time .
I need to go eat something .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money on me .
Tom felt sick .
I think that boy &apos;s name is Tom .
He &apos;s in pain .
They seem to be in a bad mood today .
Can you take me home now ?
He &apos;s sitting at the table .
I drink wine every day .
I &apos;m not here .
You ought to have known that he was sick in bed .
Come here , Tom .
Tom , may I speak to you outside ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to go back to work .
She stopped smoking .
I heard the children singing together .
I don &apos;t need a break .
My phone was out of order .
He has been dead for ten years .
Come on over to have a try .
I remember having done that somewhere .
I know you &apos;re thinking about me .
We paid for it .
We talk about it every day .
Why do they do this ?
I &apos;ve been doing that since about 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ll be coming back tonight .
Is she beautiful ?
You don &apos;t look sick to me .
I am disappointed .
The boys were quiet .
I feel good .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s Tom .
I &apos;m really happy I ran into you .
Tom was never happy .
Can Tom come tomorrow ?
I &apos;d just like to talk .
I &apos;m sure Tom &apos;s fine .
I &apos;m old .
The medicine didn &apos;t help at all .
We &apos;ve got to stop meeting like this .
I know that Mary is more beautiful than me .
I want to learn to play the guitar .
His speech was too short .
Why do people kiss ?
What am I doing ?
Someone &apos;s outside .
There are people here who need your help .
I never learned to write .
That &apos;s not the only reason .
The train is very fast .
I didn &apos;t buy anything for Tom .
It is time you went to school .
Do what you like .
Tom told Mary he hadn &apos;t seen John in years .
There &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t do .
Is this your bike ?
He wants to be a doctor in the future .
We &apos;re not from around here .
Some would say that he &apos;s playing with fire .
Tom has to go home now .
Tom turned red .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook so well , Tom .
Your answer is wrong .
I &apos;m expected .
We &apos;ll be there .
What did you study in Germany ?
Tom learned how to swim when he was three .
I &apos;m too tired to do study .
His house isn &apos;t far from this store .
I didn &apos;t see Tom at all yesterday .
I &apos;ve had this for a long time .
Tom says he &apos;s happy .
Tom wondered where Mary learned to do that .
Some people are disappointed .
I wish we had more time .
She found it difficult to answer the question .
He taught me everything I know .
I seldom go to Boston anymore .
He asked for my advice .
Give me a little money .
Tom gets up at six every morning .
Do you remember what you said ?
I don &apos;t have a garden .
Tom and Mary are students .
I just need some rest .
You don &apos;t even know how .
I don &apos;t believe it .
I broke my arm when I was a child .
Tom used to date my daughter .
The team was quite nervous before the game .
We might never see Tom again .
I want to live forever .
He is not a teacher but a student .
Isn &apos;t that your dictionary ?
I only came to say I &apos;m sorry .
The television doesn &apos;t work .
I don &apos;t want to do that .
I want to visit Tom .
I appreciate what you did for me .
Tom has enough time .
I came to see how you &apos;re doing .
Are you in ?
No one knows what &apos;s going on .
You &apos;re a better cook than I am .
Tom might get sick .
After his accident , he is happy to be alive .
We can &apos;t start today .
How old are you ?
Tom &apos;s father is in jail .
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom .
Tom eats more ice cream than I do .
I &apos;ll be free all day tomorrow .
Is Tom a teacher ?
Tom wanted to come with us .
This isn &apos;t French . It &apos;s English .
I &apos;m not at all tired .
Tom said that he wants to do everything by himself .
We really need to win .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to eat anything .
Would you like to go to the movies tomorrow night ?
I will miss you .
He died three years ago .
We went to Boston .
I did what I was told .
She couldn &apos;t look him in the face .
Did you forget something ?
I wish you had not told the story to my mother .
There &apos;s no one in the house . They &apos;re all outside .
I &apos;m the one they want .
I gave the boy what little money I had .
That &apos;s actually a really good idea .
Nobody knows you &apos;re here .
Tom is invited .
It wasn &apos;t just me who didn &apos;t like that movie .
He lives with his mother .
We have to work faster .
Why can &apos;t you just be honest ?
Tom gave Mary a call .
He must not live .
I remember everything you tell me .
Are these yours ?
Do me a favor .
I can &apos;t think of his name just now .
Tom did as I told him .
Has Tom arrived yet ?
He &apos;s not at all stupid .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think Mary really needed to do that .
Tom goes for a walk every morning .
You &apos;re really wonderful .
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ?
This is not good at all .
If you are done with the salt , please pass it to me .
Tom laughed in my face .
They may not know anything about this .
I want to be careful .
I don &apos;t want to live this way .
Let &apos;s try it .
I will always love you .
Tom comes from Australia .
I need an answer now .
I have a lot of friends to help me .
I hope you will be pleased with this present .
Tom plays piano better than Mary .
Tom asked why .
I don &apos;t like soccer .
What do you want me to do about Tom ?
You can read this book .
Who &apos;s that with Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary didn &apos;t come to the party .
He made us do the work .
Would you like more coffee ?
Tom really should speak French .
Do you want a car ?
That &apos;s not what Tom says .
I don &apos;t like it when you do that .
Tom is like a father to me .
He knows hardly anything about it .
I don &apos;t know how other people do it .
Tom still seems confused .
I do understand .
That is the house where he lives .
I am surprised to learn this .
Tom can play the piano much better than I can .
It has been two years since he came to Japan .
Tom plays tennis with Mary at least once a week .
No one said anything to me .
I hope you &apos;ll soon get well .
I &apos;d like to learn French .
Tom lived with his uncle before he came to Boston .
I &apos;m very pleased to meet you .
It is better for you to do it now .
This will be difficult to do .
Tom is short .
Tom gave me that .
Tom was always different from the other kids .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do that without Tom &apos;s help .
I am tired and I want to go to bed .
My grandfather loves to read .
He wrote a lot of books on China .
Tom said you would understand .
We love this school .
Tom seems to always be busy .
Are Tom and Mary your friends ?
It &apos;s Monday today .
There is a bank in front of the hotel .
He used to eat out every day , but now he can &apos;t afford it .
I live in a town near Boston .
Tom wants to be different .
Tom could &apos;ve gone .
It &apos;s already time to go to sleep .
She didn &apos;t want to sell the book .
I just got here yesterday .
The problem is in that it &apos;s too expensive .
I will do anything for him .
He died last year .
I haven &apos;t sent any pictures to Tom yet .
There &apos;s no explanation .
He is two years older than you .
He asked me whether she was coming .
Tom lost his job .
I guess I should &apos;ve stayed home .
Let him do as he likes .
Tom would &apos;ve helped us .
Who do you think I am ?
I can &apos;t contact Tom .
I thought we had more time .
How many boys are in this class ?
Tom made Mary one of these , too .
Tom is not at all happy .
I &apos;m sick of this .
I left my shoes at school .
A week has seven days .
Do you live here ?
Tom was late .
Tom often goes to Boston to visit his family .
Tom is at his desk .
I thought Tom already knew about that .
Would you like to have some tea ?
We shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
This bird cannot fly .
I realize it &apos;s probably too late .
Tom comes here almost every weekend .
I &apos;ve never worked in Boston .
Let them talk .
I still don &apos;t know why you asked me to be here today .
Tom is better at this than I am .
Are you hurt ?
I &apos;m not sure if this is correct .
They &apos;re family .
This is the village where my father was born .
Tom told Mary about John .
We promised .
You cannot lose .
She talks a lot about her father .
This one &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
He likes playing soccer .
You can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
She says that she wants me to come with her .
How did you find out that Tom didn &apos;t need to do that ?
I want to do it again .
Maybe they know something .
What is your reason for your being late to work ?
He looks exactly like his brother .
She can swim .
There &apos;s no way Tom would do something like that .
Tom can &apos;t see Mary from where he is .
My kids are coming to see me .
Can we come , too ?
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive .
I haven &apos;t spoken French for years .
Tom had the whole place to himself .
Do you have Tom &apos;s phone number ?
She said that she had been happy .
I &apos;ve heard it said that you should never marry your first love .
Do you sometimes study in the library ?
I think I know what to say .
You must have lost them .
Tom used to play the guitar .
I think one of these is Tom &apos;s .
How lucky we are !
Tom sat down on the bed next to Mary .
We are home .
Did you see the accident ?
I &apos;m busy right now .
It &apos;s what I would do .
How many books are in your library ?
We &apos;re still working .
Tom showed me around the park .
I know what they are .
I play soccer almost every day .
Tom is looking for his glasses .
Let me see .
Is that what you think ?
Tom is a little taller than me .
I want to know what you think .
Tom died three weeks after that .
Tom sat at his desk doing his homework .
I &apos;m not a Canadian .
If you don &apos;t want to do it for Tom , then do it for me .
You &apos;ll never forget it , I &apos;m pretty sure .
I can &apos;t help you if I don &apos;t know where you are .
Leave the door open .
I eat meat three times a week .
Why is it so quiet here ?
I thought you said you worked here .
Why are you so nice to everyone ?
I have no time to waste .
I know what Tom &apos;s thinking .
I will go .
That isn &apos;t safe .
How did this happen ?
Tom can &apos;t be over thirty .
Tom wants me to take Mary to the party .
Tom is trying really hard .
Please give me a cup of tea .
I &apos;d like to kiss you .
He looks like your brother .
Tom tried to sleep , but couldn &apos;t .
I &apos;d like to visit Boston again .
He arrived with me .
We sometimes make mistakes .
Some people like cats , others prefer dogs .
Tom works in a bank .
You and I are men .
Tom is afraid to tell the truth .
If I &apos;d had three dollars more , I could &apos;ve paid the bill .
We must stop Tom before he hurts himself .
He &apos;s after me .
The two brothers have died .
Everyone &apos;s going .
Tom looks confused .
I was waiting for you to say that .
Tom almost never says anything .
They &apos;re doing fine .
I &apos;m very tall .
She gets up at seven .
Tom would know .
I wish I could play tennis as well as Tom does .
Tom wrote the letter himself .
It may be true .
Tom has money .
She looks very young .
Where are your keys ?
People are talking .
What &apos;s their purpose ?
You &apos;re not like me .
Tom seems quite happy .
I &apos;m going out for a drink .
Tom knows the situation better than I do .
You were my friend .
His mother was right .
How did Tom get his hands on so much money ?
Tom is three years old .
We &apos;re brother and sister .
That computer might not work .
I didn &apos;t need to pay for the food .
I need air .
You can do anything you want to .
Do you know what it was ?
I don &apos;t think everyone is here yet .
I hope you will be able to come to this party .
Your hair is beautiful .
I &apos;ll give this to Tom .
Tom wanted to buy it .
You should &apos;ve told the truth .
I don &apos;t ever want to do this again .
Is it true that Tom changed his name ?
He visited France three times .
He ran into the room .
Tom is going to be sorry .
Tom almost died in that accident .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll see Tom again .
The good news is that we &apos;ll be able to help you .
I know you &apos;re happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who I am .
How did you lose it ?
Let &apos;s make it simple .
What do I get ?
Tom asked me if I wanted to dance .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s right .
Perhaps I can answer that question .
That &apos;s news to me .
I know what I want . I just haven &apos;t found it yet .
I think you knew my father .
He does not live there any more .
What do you think of that ?
Have it your own way .
You &apos;re looking tired .
I &apos;m not scared of anything .
Tom said he wanted to be alone , and then went up to his room .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like it .
Both of you be quiet .
I want to hold your hand .
Can you tell us a bit more about that ?
I &apos;d like to stay a little bit longer .
Do you understand it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know French at all .
He is said to be very poor .
I was nervous , too .
What &apos;re you doing in Boston ?
Do you want to come along with us ?
There &apos;s a good restaurant not too far from here .
Would you give me Tom &apos;s address ?
I &apos;d just like to know what I did wrong .
We can try harder .
Tom isn &apos;t like that .
I come to Australia twice a year .
We &apos;re leaving tonight .
I hate my job sometimes .
What happened to you last night ?
There &apos;s no other way to do this .
Tom &apos;s free .
Don &apos;t act so innocent .
You might want to ask Tom to help you .
I &apos;ll see you again .
When did you finish writing the letter ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
You should be a teacher .
I barely knew Tom .
Tom was here .
Do you really want to help ?
I can &apos;t remember how to go there .
How did Tom get hurt ?
Let &apos;s take a break .
Your time is running out .
I &apos;m very tired from work .
I don &apos;t mind walking in the rain .
Tom doesn &apos;t do much .
Tom can &apos;t buy himself a car .
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days .
You don &apos;t speak French , do you ?
I wish I could come with you .
I almost died .
I &apos;ve made up my mind .
Is that really necessary ?
Tom asked if I &apos;d found my key .
Are you saying you don &apos;t like it ?
Tom usually does what he says he &apos;ll do .
Tom came by bus .
He has too many books .
Tom always gets everything he wants .
You don &apos;t have to help .
This car is like new .
Tom saw what he thought was a gun in Mary &apos;s hand .
Tom isn &apos;t thinking about that .
He put on his glasses and began to read .
You aren &apos;t watching .
I can &apos;t understand his feelings .
Please feel free to ask me any question .
It &apos;s not Monday .
She is everything to him .
Tom didn &apos;t give me my money back .
I said I &apos;m sorry .
We &apos;ll drive .
I want you to tell me everything .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all like dancing .
We know about that .
Everyone made fun of me .
This medicine is good for a cold .
Did they say how ?
Do I have to go ?
There is a cat in the kitchen .
I &apos;ve missed my train .
Tom knows where I am .
Look what I made for Tom .
I just want to go home .
Look at what I made .
I won &apos;t say anything to anyone .
Who were you there with ?
Tom is through doing that .
The man reading a newspaper is his father .
Tom was the last person I expected to meet in Boston .
That happens sometimes .
Tom has gone home early .
We paid Tom thirty dollars to do that .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary just said that .
I &apos;ll see you when I get there .
Do you want to see this ?
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
Tom is really sorry .
When do you usually go to bed ?
Can &apos;t you do it ?
I didn &apos;t understand you .
Tom is going to the concert .
This is your dog .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s Mary &apos;s boyfriend , but Mary thinks that he &apos;s just a friend .
Tom must be tired .
We didn &apos;t get paid this week .
It &apos;s still Monday .
I don &apos;t have any experience .
Tom called Mary from the hotel phone .
Tom and Mary are waiting for the bus .
Is this your car ?
Maybe this weekend we could go to the beach together .
Are you from here ?
I couldn &apos;t understand a word Tom said .
He kept me waiting for more than an hour .
He kept me waiting for a long time .
Tom can &apos;t read French .
Tom drives too fast .
They didn &apos;t even know where to go .
Here &apos;s your key .
If you have something to say to me , say it .
I can &apos;t remember what I ate last night .
Tom lives in a big house all by himself .
Who did you buy this for ?
Tom has a wife .
Tom stopped reading .
Mary didn &apos;t even let Tom kiss her .
I know how much you care about Tom .
We &apos;ll never know .
I &apos;ll give you $ 30 .
We &apos;d better find it .
I feel a lot better today .
Why aren &apos;t you going ?
Is it really possible ?
I &apos;ll be honest with you .
Tom loved Mary , you know .
Tom isn &apos;t much older than Mary .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Please think it over .
I gave him the book .
I &apos;m sorry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .
He asked his teacher for advice .
I waited for Tom for three hours , but he never came .
Tom is too old for you .
All we want to do is eat .
Tom wasn &apos;t happy about the situation .
Don &apos;t you like it ?
He asked a favor of me .
I can &apos;t hear what they &apos;re saying .
Tom is eating dinner now .
What are they asking you to do ?
Tom eats fish at least once a week .
I was in a bad mood .
I &apos;d prefer not to get home until after 2 : 30 .
I am very sorry .
We need to talk to you .
Tom can speak French a little .
Have we met before ?
I could not afford to buy a bicycle .
Tom can understand you .
Does Tom still remember me ?
This coffee is too hot for me to drink .
I &apos;ll come home .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether your answer is right or wrong .
I saw Tom take it .
There are thirty names on the list .
You don &apos;t need to come into the office tomorrow .
I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Why would anyone do that on purpose ?
I know how to get there .
Are you getting tired ?
I won &apos;t let you go alone .
What &apos;s she doing ?
I can &apos;t find the knife .
Is Tom still on the job ?
I can &apos;t be sure , but I think Tom likes Mary .
What do you people do ?
You shouldn &apos;t go outside on a day like this .
Tom might &apos;ve been the one who did this , but I don &apos;t think so .
What &apos;s on TV ?
I just can &apos;t wait to get home .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to be here .
I &apos;ll do that by myself .
Tom is studying in his room .
I didn &apos;t know what to say to him .
I want to study English .
I still haven &apos;t done it .
You look a bit better today .
Yesterday he came back late .
Tom refused to speak French .
I know you &apos;re Tom .
Tom may know where Mary is .
Tom isn &apos;t drinking .
Can you even speak French ?
I only speak French at home with my parents .
Tom spent a lot of time in Boston .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before , not even my mother .
Give it to Tom .
He told everyone .
Can your mother drive a car ?
Tom is going to sit here .
What &apos;s wrong with this plan ?
I don &apos;t think he killed those men .
Who told you the story ?
I always drink a cup of coffee every morning .
I came for Tom .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t make it at that time .
This is good , isn &apos;t it ?
Take good care of yourself .
Tom is going to go to Boston by car .
This must never happen again .
They &apos;re Tom and Mary .
I can &apos;t do without your advice .
I didn &apos;t know he drank so much .
Go on .
That &apos;s not a bad idea .
They &apos;re at home .
I told you to leave me alone .
I was just thinking of a new job .
We &apos;re all alone .
What are you doing here , Tom ?
You should be able to walk in a few days .
Tom would be glad to hear that .
Tom can swim fast .
Tom is watching television .
Have I kept you waiting long ?
What &apos;s Tom got against me ?
He wrote the report .
Tom was just looking for you .
I went to that party .
I &apos;m not sure actually .
Are you fat ?
I &apos;m not a fool .
My heart wasn &apos;t in the work .
What was Tom like ?
&quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; &quot; How am I supposed to know ? &quot;
Tom heard that .
I don &apos;t see a problem with this .
I &apos;ve got to do my homework now .
He was busy .
Are you in Australia ?
I don &apos;t know anything about her family .
You &apos;re the one I like .
Tom knew that Mary had done her best .
That is the house where I was born .
I can see why Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;ve got more money than Tom has .
Tom will be very pleased .
It &apos;s a good book .
I don &apos;t see Tom a whole lot .
I need to see it now .
It &apos;s there now .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to wait .
He &apos;s about the same age as you .
It &apos;s a book on animals .
Do you have a girlfriend ?
Tom gave me all his money .
Tom does that , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t know Mary was Tom &apos;s sister .
My children don &apos;t speak French .
Tom had a beer .
I have a lot of money in the bank .
How much sugar is healthy ?
Tom and I &apos;ll do that .
I can &apos;t tell you any more than that .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to say .
She pretended that she was sick .
Tom and Mary look healthy .
I have as many books as he does .
How much do you like Tom ?
You &apos;ve gone too far .
I &apos;m looking forward to tomorrow .
That country is about twice as large as Japan .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary , but he couldn &apos;t find her .
You &apos;re the only person that I can trust .
I &apos;ll have what he &apos;s having .
Can you stop it ?
That &apos;s enough .
Tom is Mary &apos;s boss .
Why are you so sad ?
You must be Tom &apos;s mother .
I &apos;m going to be back home on Monday .
She wants to go out with him .
He became famous all over the world .
He cannot answer their questions .
We study English at school .
Where did you find it , at school or at home ?
The dog ran away from us .
Let &apos;s play baseball after school .
I like to study English .
Do you think I need to go ?
Would you like to see my new car ?
I &apos;m often in trouble .
Tom told me he was disappointed .
Tom &apos;s girlfriend saw him with another girl .
You &apos;ll be safe with me .
What &apos;s happened , has happened . It &apos;s history .
Look at Tom .
Who &apos;s that man standing over there ?
I wish I &apos;d studied harder when I was young .
What do they know that we don &apos;t ?
I &apos;ll put it on the list .
Who else knew about it ?
I know that Tom knows .
It isn &apos;t much fun just sitting here waiting for Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is busy or not .
No one I know goes there anymore .
I hope you had a good time at the party .
Everyone wants money .
I don &apos;t know the truth .
I &apos;m not going to do that .
I don &apos;t care what Tom does .
There is enough bread for all of you .
I &apos;m busy with my homework .
Why &apos;s Tom always here ?
You never asked me .
I thought Tom and Mary were busy .
Not everybody will be able to understand this .
She looks like her mother .
Tom didn &apos;t come back .
Didn &apos;t you read the book ?
That &apos;s exactly what I mean .
You must make the decision on your own .
He is old enough to drive .
I know what I saw .
I can &apos;t understand this at all .
Tom wasn &apos;t the first boy that Mary kissed .
I hope Tom knows .
He talks well .
You can tell Tom yourself .
Tom loves money .
I &apos;ve got more books than I can read .
I don &apos;t know what that means , Tom .
Tom will do anything we want him to do .
I won &apos;t go .
Are you saying you don &apos;t like this ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re right .
I know Tom likes me .
Who said that ?
Tom looks cold .
I feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back .
Tom , it doesn &apos;t work that way .
Bring him to me .
I found Tom there .
This is different .
You must be very hungry now .
I know where I &apos;m going .
He doesn &apos;t care about money .
That looks expensive .
Tom didn &apos;t need to come so early .
What should I do now ?
I &apos;m sorry for this .
Tom thought the car Mary was driving wasn &apos;t safe .
I have to think of my children .
He stole my heart .
He has two dogs .
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him .
I think we can handle the situation .
You said you &apos;d do it for me .
Why don &apos;t you come inside and we can talk about it ?
No one wanted to talk about it .
What are you called ?
How did you get the job ?
I believe I was wrong .
Tom says things are going well .
We knew that .
Tom finished his glass of milk .
I &apos;ll be happy to do it .
Are you afraid of Tom ?
I don &apos;t feel up to running to the station .
I need some time with Tom .
The man at the door wouldn &apos;t tell me his name .
You do like us , don &apos;t you ?
How long have you known Tom ?
Who wrote this letter ?
I have something to ask of you .
You &apos;re not going in there .
What have you been doing ?
This book was written by Tom .
I &apos;ll be back soon .
Please feed the dog every day .
Tom was sick last week .
Did you meet him ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk right now .
If I &apos;d stayed any longer , I would &apos;ve gotten bored .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll rain tonight .
I love watching you cook .
I thought I &apos;d go with you .
Tom fell .
I know where you want to be .
Are you with Tom ?
I &apos;d rather take a taxi than walk .
Her life is in danger .
I think about you all day long .
You know I can &apos;t .
I believe he is going to be rich one day .
That &apos;s my dog .
I want to change my life .
Tom came to my office yesterday .
Tom and Mary have been best of friends for years .
He has decided not to go to the meeting .
The kid got hurt .
I didn &apos;t even get a chance to eat anything .
Tom &apos;s house is easy to find .
Tom and I &apos;ll go with Mary .
He does not get up early .
You are too young to be in love .
He tried to speak French to us .
That makes me very happy .
Both his sisters are beautiful .
Tom made up his mind to be a doctor .
I threw the paper into the fire .
Did Tom speak French ?
How many people are at this party ?
Tom likes to be here .
The weather stayed bad .
I &apos;ve already tried doing it that way .
Your time is over .
Why isn &apos;t Tom sleeping ?
I don &apos;t know what this word means .
I &apos;m not drinking .
What does Tom want to eat ?
We &apos;ll all die sooner or later .
Tom is a lot younger than Mary .
It &apos;s been a long week .
Tom doesn &apos;t get up early .
Could you explain to me what happened ?
How fast was Tom driving ?
Tom walked in the room .
I am talking with Tom .
What do you know about what happened ?
All we can do is wait .
I &apos;m almost sure of it .
Tom said he was from Australia .
Don &apos;t be so shy .
Tom likes to do almost everything by himself .
My brother is still sleeping .
Didn &apos;t they teach you anything at school ?
You &apos;ve done it again .
I found that restaurant by accident .
You did so much better this time .
I know what it &apos;s like to be alone .
Nobody was to blame for the accident .
Maybe it never happened .
I completely forgot about that .
My mother &apos;s going to kill me .
Don &apos;t kid yourself .
You should go .
Tom told the truth .
My daughter went to school .
He was very busy all day .
Is Tom outside ?
I should never have let you do that by yourself .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
I think I &apos;m a good teacher .
I &apos;m just trying to understand you .
I saw you looking at Tom .
You broke your promise .
I didn &apos;t care if anybody saw me .
We &apos;re working on that .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re fat .
You &apos;re just a kid .
My father takes a walk every morning .
Tom wants to show you something .
She has no one to speak to .
It &apos;s all I want .
I have to help my mother .
Tom is my friend .
She just left .
Please give me a cup of coffee .
Tom worked here .
I &apos;m looking forward to next summer .
I may have hurt his feelings .
Please be careful .
Can you help me study ?
I see what &apos;s going on .
When will you come home ?
He is angry with me .
Tell me if you need anything else .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told me that .
You aren &apos;t welcome here .
I wonder if I &apos;ll ever get married .
Tom and Mary are playing tennis now .
We want to see you .
I want my own room .
He wanted to be rich .
I couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
Give it a try .
I don &apos;t have a car .
Tom got home .
I want to know who did that .
All you had to do was ask .
You haven &apos;t said anything to Tom , have you ?
How do you know where I live ?
I told Tom I wouldn &apos;t win .
Tom thinks Mary isn &apos;t here .
I might never see you again .
Tom looks old for his age .
Tom is taller than Mary .
I &apos;ve already written to Tom .
Tom and his friends are outside .
Everyone has problems .
I &apos;m not sure yet .
We went to Boston last month to visit Tom .
Why is Tom learning French ?
He does not study hard enough .
I &apos;m here to take Tom home .
I will wait .
They already know .
Do you like it when I do this ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
Do you want to tell me what this is ?
He is very young .
Who are you coming with ?
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you for over a week .
Tom called Mary to the telephone .
These are my books .
It wasn &apos;t possible for the boy to swim across the river .
It &apos;s just started raining .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Tom opened his book .
The chair hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
Does this hurt ?
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t arrived yet .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished yet .
Tom is a small person .
Tom began singing .
Tom arrived just a moment too late .
You should have one of us do it .
Bring wine .
What do I get out of it ?
What makes you think that I like you ?
I advised Tom to not do that .
That was different .
I don &apos;t have much time left .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much time to waste .
Tom arrived just as I was going home .
I see you &apos;re doing very well in your business .
It is not so difficult as you think .
I don &apos;t know him very well .
She has not come here yet .
He made a mistake .
Look at what you &apos;ve become .
You can use this phone .
How do you say &quot; I love you &quot; in French ?
Tom usually gets everything he wants .
I thought you had already eaten .
Tom fell asleep on the couch .
If I were you , I would buy it .
Tom was pretty much drunk .
How do we do it ?
I &apos;ve tried doing it that way already .
We need to do this report again .
Tom wants to live in Boston .
I made fun of him .
We almost missed the train .
Can you show me how to do this ?
I should &apos;ve stayed in bed .
Who &apos;s ready for more ?
It &apos;s easy .
I thought you might change your mind .
That &apos;s what I hope .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
I should &apos;ve told Tom .
Tom stopped suddenly .
I gave Tom another chance .
I don &apos;t want to start anything I can &apos;t finish .
My car is not running .
It &apos;ll be hard to find someone to do that .
I &apos;m free tonight .
I &apos;ll be in bed by the time you get home .
I &apos;d love to see you .
That looks like Tom .
Who &apos;s older , you or Tom ?
He stayed in London over a month .
Do you have many friends here in Japan ?
I &apos;m disappointed that he &apos;s not here .
Tom is making money off us .
What a bad movie !
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I &apos;ve got friends in Boston .
I want to see my brother .
I think that this is the way to do it .
My mother gets up early .
May I say something ?
This is all that I know .
She left the room without saying a word .
Tom wrote down Mary &apos;s phone number .
I hardly understood anything .
We &apos;re meeting in an hour in front of the hotel .
I &apos;d like to see you again next week .
I want you to go to the post office .
That can &apos;t be true .
I don &apos;t speak Japanese .
Will you make room for me ?
I &apos;ll go on my own .
I want to visit you .
I can &apos;t stand it .
Whose pencil is this ?
Many of these are mine .
Don &apos;t forget it .
Why are you looking at me ?
Why does this always happen to me ?
I &apos;d like you to see it .
I &apos;m sorry that I haven &apos;t been able to be here for you like I should have been .
They got here yesterday .
I want to go with you , Tom .
I think Tom was drunk .
She takes a walk with her dog every day .
It wasn &apos;t easy .
Tom has been nice to everyone .
I &apos;ve got a secret .
We just got here .
Where does Tom do that ?
Don &apos;t give up !
She dressed like a boy .
Where do these come from ?
Please give me a glass of milk .
This box is so large that it cannot go into my bag .
Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s hot ?
I have a lot of things to do this morning .
What does Tom want to do ?
He may have read the letter .
You want me to go , don &apos;t you ?
How long ago did Tom leave ?
I did it for you .
He drinks a lot of milk every day .
What didn &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;ll call you in an hour .
I can &apos;t tell you yet .
We &apos;ve arrived a little late .
John is two years older than I am .
Is everything all right at the office ?
Tom and Mary are working on something together .
I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
What &apos;re we supposed to do with that ?
You &apos;ll be with me .
I will be the cook tonight .
Did Tom talk to anyone else ?
Let &apos;s wind up our work .
She is writing a letter now .
Tom didn &apos;t take an umbrella with him .
That &apos;s the way it is .
I wasn &apos;t sure if Tom had eaten yet .
I would like to see Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t come .
I just sat there trying not to think about how alone I felt .
She sat next to him .
I tried to get Tom to help Mary .
I can do that .
Tom gave up hope .
Please take this seat .
I &apos;ve forgotten where I put my passport .
You &apos;re not my girlfriend anymore .
Tom knows the family .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to answer this question .
I don &apos;t like this hat .
Tom is still a little boy .
Tom wants it .
We need a doctor .
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak French very well .
Why did you lie ?
Tom is the best father I know .
I have three times as many books as he does .
Is Tom married ?
I used to talk to Tom a lot .
Can you teach me how to play the guitar like you do ?
We are invited to dinner .
Why do you hate Tom so much ?
You can &apos;t make everyone happy .
Tom has enough money to buy what he wants .
What hat do you like ?
I have to go do this .
You &apos;ll learn how to do it sooner or later .
How many days did you spend in Boston ?
We understand this .
All you have to do is give him a little help .
The boys were as nervous as the girls .
Tom died at the hospital .
I thought I &apos;d lost Mary forever .
I have a question for you .
It won &apos;t change anything .
Tom and Mary play golf together .
I quite agree .
She is not to blame .
Tom knows where I hid the money .
I will have to be away for some time .
I think it would be a mistake to do that .
I &apos;m sure you did your best .
When did he fall ill ?
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she didn &apos;t want to .
Tom is in your car .
I have no one to talk to .
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom does .
How long will you have to wait ?
Why does everybody love cats ?
Is he coming home at six o &apos;clock ?
Can you come with me now ?
Just go back to the kitchen .
Tom understood .
I &apos;ll wait until four o &apos;clock .
Maybe she won &apos;t come .
What &apos;s going on out here ?
I will give you whatever is in this box .
She seems rich .
We want one .
Tom is a friend from school .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me that he was married .
He was ill , so he couldn &apos;t come .
It &apos;s too quiet .
I called Tom up .
The best way to learn a language is to live in a country where it &apos;s spoken .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
I wish I were rich enough to buy a car like that .
I &apos;ll be able to finish in a day or two .
What did he do yesterday ?
I can &apos;t see anything without my glasses .
I have family in Boston .
I love to dance .
I think he &apos;ll come .
Tom was fired last week .
I couldn &apos;t sleep .
Tom wants to do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that .
Everyone is very proud of you .
He has written many books about China .
He doesn &apos;t know English at all .
A man like me needs a hat .
That &apos;s not very good , is it ?
I study French with Tom three times each week .
I have to hurry !
Tom is certain .
Is everybody ready ?
Tom is going to be fine .
I feel very sick .
I think I &apos;ll buy this tie .
I thought Tom was on vacation in Australia .
Both of my parents are dead .
Where is my money ?
Tom has to look after Mary .
Tom will have a difficult time doing that .
I have a new book I &apos;m working on .
Nobody died .
I thought it was true .
I &apos;ve always wanted a child .
We can &apos;t tell Tom .
What time does Tom leave for work ?
I saw a man with a child .
I got back home earlier than I thought I would .
She has a kind heart .
Tom knows where we live .
She does not do things like that .
I need something to eat .
Tom speaks fast .
You &apos;d better tell Tom you &apos;re sorry .
Is Tom sure ?
Tom asked her if she was Mary .
Why don &apos;t you take a break ?
Tom knows Mary would never do such a thing .
It was a very long meeting .
I &apos;ll see you Monday .
Nobody lives in this house .
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him .
Whose is this bicycle ?
There seemed to be no answer to the problem .
Tom wanted more .
Tom needs you here .
Which is our car ?
Are you happy with your life ?
It &apos;ll take two hours to get there by bus .
You worked a lot this week .
I &apos;m not famous .
I like it .
Did you hear what Tom said about Mary ?
That &apos;s Tom .
I &apos;m the only one who ever really liked Tom .
I don &apos;t know if I can come .
Could you tell me your name again ?
What has happened to him ?
I &apos;m willing to give it a try .
Tom works for a large company .
Tom talks too fast .
Do you know how much this means to me ?
Is she so stupid that she believes that kind a thing ?
I &apos;d like to ask you about a student of yours .
I &apos;ve still got things to do .
Is Tom your brother ?
Tom won &apos;t have time to do that .
Who are you angry at ?
I &apos;m three years younger than you .
Did she sleep well ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell anyone ?
Why didn &apos;t you just ask ?
Where did you get that ?
French is spoken here .
Tom has so much money that he doesn &apos;t know what to do with it .
I &apos;ve left my watch at home .
Children can &apos;t drink wine .
Christmas is just a few days away .
Is something wrong , Tom ?
Tom has to be hot .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I can &apos;t do that .
Tom seemed to be worried about me .
I asked him for his phone number .
I saw it coming .
Tom waited till the door was closed .
Tom and Mary were sitting side by side .
Tom is a friend of the family .
My father has a lot of books .
What color is your house ?
Bring all your friends next time .
He &apos;s not in .
I just want to forget about it .
I &apos;d rather do something else .
I think Tom and Mary don &apos;t know each other .
I forgot to close the window .
Tom is your teacher .
Did you hear about what happened last night ?
She knows where we live .
People here are happy .
Who found Tom ?
Do you eat rice every day ?
You &apos;re really lucky .
It was not an accident .
He was in the hospital for a week .
Nothing happens by chance .
Tom knows what to expect .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
I wish we could do this every day .
I told Tom what happened .
What color is Tom &apos;s dog ?
Her books sell pretty well .
I think we &apos;d better wait a little longer .
It &apos;s time to get down to business .
What do you have to lose ?
Tom is working with us .
I say what I think .
You don &apos;t want to know .
I cannot afford the time for a vacation .
He &apos;ll be along in ten minutes .
I &apos;m going to do it .
Tom is calm .
Tom was playing the piano .
I still have to go to Australia three more times this year .
Those are Tom &apos;s , I think .
Tom has taught me a few things .
What &apos;s in here , Tom ?
Tom can take care of that .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like me .
Tom often talks to his dog .
I &apos;m waiting for someone .
How &apos;d you get here ?
Who are these for ?
I don &apos;t think Tom saw us .
I have almost no money with me .
We just got here yesterday .
I &apos;ll see to it right away .
I &apos;m quite busy .
Tom looks ready .
Tom and Mary are getting married next weekend .
Do you really think Tom will let you do that ?
You &apos;ve come too early .
Tom is waiting for you .
I need to know tomorrow .
I arrived three days ago .
Tom is as strong as I am .
We got a good price for that .
They &apos;re in danger .
I waited for Tom to apologize , but he didn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t want to do it like that .
I am at home .
That &apos;s the only way .
I &apos;ll see you there .
Just don &apos;t tell Tom I sent you .
Did you read the whole book ?
I just want to be with you .
Why don &apos;t you go home ?
Tom ate alone .
What are you doing down here ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know that Mary was able to speak French .
Tom and Mary both want to go .
Tom was in love with Mary .
I &apos;m surprised .
Tom used to stay with us every summer .
I think Tom is going to call you .
What do you say to that ?
It &apos;s been nice talking to you , but I really must go now .
That &apos;s not very good .
I only want to help you .
I &apos;d like to study with you tonight , but I can &apos;t .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s different from other people .
I &apos;ve seen this movie twice .
Why quit now ?
She barely ate her lunch .
I &apos;m coming with you .
What a big dog !
I wonder if that &apos;s Tom .
I think I &apos;m ready .
That was totally my fault .
I &apos;d like to call my parents .
The new store is going to open next week .
I &apos;m not thinking about it .
They are going shopping .
Tom wants you to do it .
Tom paid nothing .
I &apos;m not sure yet , but I think I &apos;ll become a teacher .
I &apos;ll visit my uncle in Boston next month .
Nobody must know .
Tom wasn &apos;t busy .
I stopped smoking and drinking .
My father will help me .
I think this is a big mistake .
Tom will be so proud .
Tom wants to be friends with Mary .
Tom wants to learn .
Tom wondered why Mary wouldn &apos;t help him .
They &apos;re talking about you .
I don &apos;t see your name on it .
I &apos;m eating dinner now .
I go to bed very early .
We think you &apos;re doing very well here .
I don &apos;t see why everyone thinks this book is so good .
Tom is taller than his father .
It &apos;s a matter of when , not if .
Tom was at school .
Tom has changed a lot .
Take Tom home .
Someone is playing the piano .
Tom kept running .
Tom promised never to do that again .
What I meant to say was that I didn &apos;t want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with me .
He &apos;s never been in love before .
What &apos;re you guys doing here ?
He must not find out the truth .
What &apos;re you doing for the break ?
My son likes to play with cars .
We &apos;re out of milk .
I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch .
I can &apos;t find the newspaper .
Tom is going to love being here .
Who told you I couldn &apos;t speak French ?
He is able to play the guitar .
The water was too hot yesterday .
They &apos;re coming again .
I wanted to see what would happen .
Just because something is possible doesn &apos;t make it a good idea .
We &apos;re going to name him Tom .
I &apos;ve told you that a hundred times .
Tom is already married .
What will you have to drink ?
It seems she hates you .
I &apos;ve lost it .
I felt very happy .
I want you to see what you &apos;ve done .
Tell the others to hurry up .
Tom doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
How is your brother ?
We don &apos;t get along with each other .
Tom put his shirt back on .
She &apos;s much better today .
Are you sure Tom is happy ?
Tom has a brother in Australia .
Tom was really tired .
She lives with him .
Am I correct ?
You could ask Tom .
Is Tom with you ?
You really look great .
He plays baseball every day .
This is all the money I have .
I have some things to take care of .
Keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health .
We want to know .
Are you students ?
Are they coming here tomorrow ?
We &apos;ll all die .
I &apos;m late , aren &apos;t I ?
I have to answer the phone .
I don &apos;t know and I don &apos;t want to know .
Get a doctor in here .
I only have one friend left .
My French isn &apos;t that good .
I &apos;m very proud of you .
Do you know who I am ?
Tom knew that the story wasn &apos;t true .
I have to talk to Tom .
What am I doing here ?
I was glad to help .
Has he arrived yet ?
This is my city now .
Do you like being famous ?
I saw Tom a few minutes ago .
Aren &apos;t you going to finish your dinner ?
I want to know how you did it .
Tom wanted a new car .
It is certain that he will come .
Have you ever been inside Tom &apos;s house ?
The rain changed to snow .
What are you wearing ?
He can do whatever he likes with the money .
You &apos;ll get into trouble .
Tom got into the car and drove away .
What don &apos;t you like about Tom ?
When &apos;s your birthday ?
They don &apos;t get along together .
Do you want a glass of water ?
He would often say such a thing .
I know you &apos;re not doing that .
Are you going to be able to help Tom ?
I want you to know that Tom &apos;s doing OK .
I &apos;ve never told anyone this before .
There is a message for you .
This book is too difficult to understand .
I forgot to ask Tom .
Where did you see the woman ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like this one bit .
We often hear you sing .
Tom can &apos;t help it .
The idea is not new .
Who &apos;s going to take care of my dog while I &apos;m gone ?
It &apos;s time for lunch .
I hear that he &apos;s still alive .
You haven &apos;t changed and you never will .
Is that really important ?
Tom and Mary had nothing in the world except each other .
Tom is likely to arrive before 2 : 30 .
He seemed to be ill .
Is this your suitcase ?
Who is absent ?
I want much more .
This won &apos;t take long .
I told Tom to help Mary , but he didn &apos;t .
I have known Tom since I was a little boy .
I believe Tom .
I know how to do that .
We know him .
I &apos;m looking for Tom . Have you seen him ?
I didn &apos;t expect to see you at a place like this .
I am tall .
There were at least a hundred people present .
I don &apos;t like what you &apos;re doing .
What age was she when she first drove a car ?
There &apos;s nothing I can do .
Let us know if you &apos;re coming .
Let &apos;s talk over the matter .
It &apos;s not easy .
It &apos;s not a secret that Tom &apos;s opinion is different than yours .
Are you telling the truth ?
Do you think that will change anything ?
We can &apos;t go .
Tom doesn &apos;t work anymore .
The movie is about to start .
I tried to do that .
Why don &apos;t we take Tom there ?
I came here to see Tom .
She still loves him even though he doesn &apos;t love her anymore .
I know you can do it .
It &apos;s my only hope .
Is Tom ready to leave ?
Who is that man ?
Tom and I are old friends .
He is good at driving .
Tom went back to sleep .
Why is Tom looking at me ?
I was asked to fix the bicycle .
We have enough time to catch the train .
Is Tom your name ?
Will it be hot tomorrow ?
You can &apos;t leave yet , Tom .
Who is your friend ?
Tom can get to work faster on bicycle than by car .
Isn &apos;t there anything you want to tell me ?
We want to see Tom do that .
He got on the train .
I know that he &apos;s Tom .
Take a seat , please .
We have had little rain this summer .
I hope that was what you wanted .
I &apos;m taking it with me .
Tom is thirty years old .
Tom and I don &apos;t get along .
Tom gave us all the money he had on him .
I think I &apos;d better stay here .
They &apos;re laughing .
I hope we win .
This means a lot to me .
It &apos;s almost impossible .
Don &apos;t worry about my dog .
I can &apos;t do anything .
She is poor , but she is happy .
I will stay until tomorrow .
Tom is a very good person .
What exactly do you want to know ?
You can &apos;t be everyone &apos;s friend all the time .
She is about as tall as me .
Is this your picture ?
That &apos;s against the rules .
We would die without air .
Have you said anything to Tom ?
What is wrong with her ?
When do you play tennis ?
I could answer his question .
It wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s idea . It was mine .
You must make your parents happy .
That sounds like a job for Tom .
What kind of lawyer are you ?
He was too young to go to school .
I agree to your plan .
Don &apos;t tell Tom I said that .
Does Tom have a car ?
Tom opened the door for Mary .
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night .
Is it cold in Germany ?
I &apos;ll get ready .
Tom died Monday .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re right .
I do not think that he will come .
Tom visited Australia .
He arrived as soon as he could .
Tom had no reason to be angry .
Is there anybody who can drive a car ?
We lost sight of him .
She has a dog and six cats .
Are you still there ?
We &apos;re doing it the right way .
Tom ate .
I thought the woman I met yesterday was Tom &apos;s mother .
They &apos;ll go shopping .
Tom knew that would happen .
I want to thank Tom .
Tom says that he loves Mary .
Tom and Mary often play tennis together .
Tom often plays the guitar .
You promised you wouldn &apos;t tell .
I &apos;ll buy you a drink .
Is your family doing OK ?
I don &apos;t care what she eats .
Why didn &apos;t you buy any coffee ?
He is sure that he will pass the next exam .
I don &apos;t know what to believe .
There is no beach in this area .
How many of your students are here ?
Don &apos;t keep me waiting .
He left ten minutes ago .
This radio is out of order .
Tom threw the ball .
You will all die .
She is nothing but a child .
It &apos;s not about money .
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem .
It &apos;s not a game .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think Mary really wants to do that .
If you want me to help you , all you have to do is ask .
You &apos;re back .
Even though he was tired , he worked .
I don &apos;t really have a boyfriend .
Why is she hiding ?
You need to wash your hands .
I asked Tom to wait for me at the train station .
Did you tell Tom about this ?
He does not like us .
It &apos;s a big hospital .
Tom isn &apos;t the one who did this .
Tom is cute .
I like pizza very much .
Do as I say .
I thought you said you didn &apos;t trust Tom .
I think I broke his heart .
He rarely goes to the movies .
Tom is in his office waiting .
You can wait here .
Tom wasn &apos;t killed .
Tom walked into Mary &apos;s room .
Tom looks pleased .
I can &apos;t fix this computer .
What did he do to my meat ?
You &apos;re a bad person .
I won &apos;t leave .
What &apos;ll Tom do with that ?
We &apos;re married .
Look at the price .
Let &apos;s do only one thing at a time .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
I &apos;m worried for you .
Tom must be at least thirty years old .
I don &apos;t know what I believe .
Would you be kind enough to pass the salt ?
Why did you go to his house ?
Tom &apos;s not busy .
Tom has nothing to do here .
Tom says that recently he isn &apos;t able to get enough sleep .
Tom knew exactly what he was doing .
Tom usually goes to school by bus .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a brother .
I haven &apos;t bought a new coat in five years .
Tom received a letter from Mary this morning .
Why is it so important ?
You &apos;re not helping .
If I were you , I would not do it .
I want to spend my life with Mary .
Your question has no answer .
Tom won &apos;t forget this .
I &apos;ll let you know tomorrow .
When does Tom want to do that ?
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston .
Tom said nothing .
Tom is three years older than you .
We now live in Boston .
Have you decided what you &apos;ll do ?
I like your dogs .
Why is that important ?
Are they satisfied ?
She refused to eat her lunch .
I found Tom .
I am busy now and can &apos;t play with you .
Did you see him at the station this morning ?
Is his father a doctor ?
Tom knows everything there is to know about cars .
Tom gave Mary the key .
I hate to eat alone .
I didn &apos;t buy anything .
What &apos;s that on your face ?
I &apos;m eating lunch .
Tom told Mary something and she smiled .
My horse is white .
You really don &apos;t know who that is , do you ?
It looks like we both had the same idea .
Can you call for help ?
I want to go swimming with a friend .
I have never heard him speak ill of others .
Tom is going to like that .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French well and I don &apos;t either .
It &apos;s one of our rules .
You know you can trust me .
They were right .
Maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
Tom isn &apos;t sure .
We plan to go as far as we can .
Call the hospital .
He himself tried it .
Don &apos;t you want to go to Boston ?
I &apos;ve already forgotten Tom &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s name .
Why did you buy it ?
I know you &apos;ve got a secret .
Don &apos;t say a word .
I didn &apos;t forget you .
We aren &apos;t going to sing that song .
I thought it would be a good idea .
Would you prefer tea ?
What &apos;s that got to do with Tom ?
You &apos;re invited .
You can &apos;t please everyone .
She &apos;s five years younger than me .
I hope the bus will come before long .
They don &apos;t want us here .
I have a brother .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t understand .
Tom is really cute .
I thought you were Tom &apos;s friend .
Are you pleased with your new house ?
When will he be back ?
I &apos;ve been gone three weeks .
I am listening to a song .
Do you have a best friend ?
I &apos;m scared of Tom &apos;s dog .
This computer &apos;s a lot faster than the old one .
She talked a lot .
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened .
Why wasn &apos;t anything about that in the report ?
We already ate .
There has always been war and there always will be .
You work too much .
You &apos;re not my friend anymore .
I had more questions , but Tom seemed to be tired of my questions , so I didn &apos;t ask them .
I wasn &apos;t busy yesterday .
This is mine , and that &apos;s yours .
Tom hardly talks at all .
I don &apos;t remember it .
This is the town where he was born .
Maybe I should write Tom a letter .
Let &apos;s take a taxi .
Why do you care so much ?
It &apos;s just a cold .
I have to solve this problem .
I don &apos;t know when he will come .
Can you hear us ?
You never know what &apos;ll happen .
She broke into tears .
I never had to worry about money .
Tom says he likes studying French .
Tom refused to help Mary .
Tom does that .
Tom looked .
Tom &apos;s thirty .
He &apos;s always looking at you . He must love you .
Did Tom hurt himself ?
I &apos;ll be in my office from ten tomorrow .
They don &apos;t need me anymore .
Tom took a few things out of his suitcase .
I &apos;ve asked you this question before .
I knew nobody would believe me .
I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
You need to make a decision .
Why not go to Boston ?
She has a lot of friends here .
Even when I was a child , I was able to swim well .
Be careful , Tom !
I &apos;m going to learn French .
I don &apos;t have time to help you right now .
Where &apos;s your other brother ?
I hope to see you the next time you are in Tokyo .
Where were you working last year ?
Tom wants to be famous .
Tom is so strong .
What time is it now by your watch ?
I know that Tom was right .
You know that better than I do .
We &apos;re staying .
We play baseball .
What do you want , Tom ?
I don &apos;t think I want that .
I don &apos;t know what Tom saw .
Tom waited for Mary to come home .
Tom sat next to me in church .
They hardly have any time left .
This is impossible .
Tom said that he wanted to forget about what happened .
Has Tom ever asked you to help him ?
I &apos;ll call you a taxi .
Who was it that did that yesterday ?
Tom gets up early .
I &apos;m taking Tom home with me .
Don &apos;t be nervous .
May I eat another piece of cake ?
I lost my job on Monday .
You can &apos;t buy it anywhere but there .
Is that Tom &apos;s house ?
He &apos;s in danger .
Does she have children ?
How sick is Tom ?
Tom knows I want to leave as soon as possible .
What do you mean by that ?
I haven &apos;t decided yet whether I will attend the party .
Are you in there ?
Tom quit school .
We know Tom .
Tom was real happy .
I ran as fast as I could .
Tell Tom you can &apos;t do that .
Do you go to church every Sunday ?
Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
He gave it a new name .
Mary &apos;s parents were very impressed with Tom .
I want Tom to do that .
Who &apos;s next on the list ?
I learn a lot from my father .
It is dangerous to drive so fast .
Tom will be disappointed .
Tom used to date Mary .
You may not like it .
&quot; Are you still mad at me ? &quot; &quot; No , not at all . &quot;
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do first .
Please feed the cat .
I cannot find time to read the book .
That sounds like a lot of fun .
You can read French , can &apos;t you ?
I would like to have this camera .
Is that a lot ?
You didn &apos;t tell me everything .
Let me know .
I don &apos;t know what Tom wants .
I didn &apos;t say it like that .
I don &apos;t know how to swim .
I don &apos;t get this .
I have to go . It &apos;s getting late .
I &apos;ll be there in about 30 minutes .
She &apos;s a lot better today .
Tom looks lost .
Why don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
Tom is willing to do that for you .
What exactly happened there ?
I &apos;m not hungry .
I &apos;ve known about this for years .
You don &apos;t know who did it , do you ?
That isn &apos;t what I said .
I didn &apos;t buy the book .
Did Tom say something to you ?
Tom knows us well .
He speaks four languages .
My parents will be happy .
Tom hasn &apos;t done any work .
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you .
Tom is still in Boston .
I just want to be alone .
Tom told me what happened when you tried to kiss Mary .
I don &apos;t want to be the one to do that .
He &apos;s a man now .
She left her umbrella in the train .
Have you seen it ?
Would you like to come with us ?
What &apos;s going on in here ?
Have you heard whether Tom got the job ?
I have to go to bed .
We don &apos;t have enough beer .
Thanks for being here .
Where are you from ?
You can &apos;t smoke in here .
I talk to myself all the time .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to speak French .
I learned a lot about Tom from Mary .
I &apos;m about to turn thirty .
I like to do things like that .
That &apos;s what I told them .
I &apos;ve been looking for you all day .
Nobody believes me .
Tom should &apos;ve worked harder .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
You &apos;ll have to come tomorrow .
That &apos;d be nice .
I remember it now .
Tom had a good reason to do that .
That &apos;s just not true .
She &apos;s at the hotel now .
Please let me go home .
I didn &apos;t need any help doing that .
When I was about to leave my house , I got a phone call from Tom .
What &apos;s today &apos;s plan ?
What &apos;s Tom eating ?
I bought her a watch .
I don &apos;t know what they do .
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Boston .
Call me immediately after you meet him .
This sounds interesting .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m ready .
Tom sometimes goes to work by bus .
Tom certainly didn &apos;t seem to be expecting us .
I like this house as it is .
You must study English hard .
Tom can sleep in my room .
Tom didn &apos;t speak French very well .
There wasn &apos;t anything I could do to help Tom .
I still have so much to do .
He ran so he would get there on time .
I want to go out .
Thanks for the good advice .
It shouldn &apos;t matter .
He wants to be like me .
Do you know where you are , Tom ?
Is your mom here ?
We &apos;ve got something for you .
I &apos;ll never be as good as you .
I know how it is .
Is Tom going to school today ?
They don &apos;t want Tom there .
Have you finished ?
It &apos;s important to read books .
I &apos;m not afraid of anything .
Are we just friends ?
We can &apos;t even be certain Tom will attend the meeting .
I don &apos;t like being alone .
Tell Tom it was a mistake .
I know his name isn &apos;t Tom .
There &apos;s one thing I must tell you .
We &apos;re pretty pleased with that .
I have homework .
What does Tom do ?
What would Tom have done first ?
Tom felt nothing .
How &apos;s it coming ?
We &apos;re very busy just now .
People don &apos;t want to hear that .
My cat is really smart .
What will they do ?
Can you come to the office by train ?
That &apos;s what I do .
It is hard for me to believe this .
He got well again .
Tom is good at driving .
He asked her questions .
I cannot quite understand it .
You don &apos;t need to go if you don &apos;t want to .
The TV was on all night .
He never wears a tie .
Tom kept reading .
You can go if you want .
Tom &apos;s parents are older than mine .
My father is two years younger than my mother .
Tom wants to help .
Tom sat down on the floor .
He is always on the go .
You don &apos;t know what Tom is like .
I met him when I was a student .
If you can , come with us .
Don &apos;t you want to be rich ?
I need a new computer .
Have you ever been here before ?
Is Tom good at playing golf ?
What is it you &apos;d like me to do ?
You can use this car .
What does that tell us ?
I only ate one piece of cake .
This report is badly written and is full of mistakes .
Tom will be glad to see you .
&quot; Why did Tom do that ? &quot; &quot; Do what ? &quot;
How many people were present at the meeting ?
Do you think Tom would be willing to show me how to do that ?
Why is snow white ?
Tom went on reading .
I feel happy when I &apos;m with you .
I have not been sick for the past ten years .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that kind of thing to him .
Thank you for telling me .
What are you doing right now ?
Tom made a lot of mistakes .
He &apos;s not my type .
I wrote a long letter to him .
No one had an answer .
What &apos;s there to do ?
What kind of dog is it ?
Tom entered the kitchen .
There are many flowers in the garden .
What do you do in London ?
Tom did what he had been told .
I hope it works .
Why haven &apos;t you gone to the police ?
I &apos;m free .
I &apos;m a high school student .
You &apos;ve lost everything .
He plays tennis every day .
Tom is about thirty .
I &apos;d rather not do that .
I &apos;m almost done with the report .
Are there any problems I should know about ?
Why didn &apos;t you answer your phone ?
Tom made a run for it .
I got it for next to nothing .
She &apos;s been wearing the same hat for a month .
Can we swim here ?
How did you and Tom meet ?
Do you think English is difficult ?
Could you please tell Tom to be quiet ?
They lost everything .
Tom asked Mary to help me .
Tom kept warm .
He is a teacher at our school .
I go there every year .
Tom enjoyed himself a lot at the party .
Tom spent some time doing that .
My mother knows Tom &apos;s mother .
It is possible that you have already read this book .
He keeps making the same mistake .
I &apos;m pleased to hear that .
This is my big break .
I don &apos;t want to see your face ever again .
Don &apos;t you want Tom there ?
We aren &apos;t going to stay at that hotel again .
Bring me a glass of water .
I realized I wasn &apos;t ready .
Tom seemed surprised .
It &apos;s not hard to find .
I read the book .
I was looking for you .
Bring me my shoes .
They laugh at him behind his back .
Tom is exactly three weeks old .
This is not about money .
Tom always wears a hat .
It &apos;s rather hot out here .
I didn &apos;t buy everything Tom asked me to buy .
No one likes Tom .
He seems not to have known it .
I already did that twice today .
Tom can &apos;t find his watch .
Tom lives in the city .
Here &apos;s how to use it .
It was very nice of you to help me with my homework .
I &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over .
We talked for some time .
I &apos;m thinking of going abroad next year .
What do you like to eat ?
We want Tom to stay for a couple of more days .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom have to do that ?
It must be Tom .
It didn &apos;t really hurt .
My clock is two minutes fast .
I only hope that that is enough .
Tom told everyone he was able to speak three languages .
I &apos;ll call you back soon .
I don &apos;t know where that is .
Tom spent the night on the couch .
It &apos;s impossible to fix it .
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog .
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you .
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom that .
Why are you being so nice to me ?
It is difficult for him to solve the problem .
Is that my hat ?
I couldn &apos;t sleep all night .
Mary has flowers in her hair .
Get me my food .
I will help as much as I can .
That car is very new .
I want to buy a new camera .
She made tea for me .
Is there no other way ?
Why don &apos;t we ask for his advice ?
That leaves no room for doubt .
The door was half open .
He plays the piano very well .
I already knew that .
I want to know where they are .
Did you forget to buy eggs ?
Could you please turn the radio on ?
That &apos;s the village I was born in .
Leave Tom alone , please .
What can I get you ?
The game ended at nine o &apos;clock .
I really wish there was something I could do .
Tom isn &apos;t tall .
Tom did that .
She is always busy .
Tell us the truth , Tom .
I never swim by myself .
Tom stayed at a hotel .
My father does not like music .
I really need to talk to you .
Tom came here to see me .
Tom ran out of money .
What is your decision ?
He called me up almost every day .
You &apos;re welcome to wait here .
Tom asked a lot of questions .
I &apos;m not going to your house .
Tom doesn &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
I know it &apos;s hot .
I can &apos;t afford a new car this year .
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t remember anything .
Thanks for taking the time to help .
She works in a bank .
He closed the door .
I haven &apos;t eaten .
Mary is Tom &apos;s sister .
I like bread .
I don &apos;t like this type of house .
Have you met Tom &apos;s new girlfriend ?
Tom &apos;s voice was calm .
It is not worth the trouble .
We &apos;re going to Boston .
I &apos;m not good at singing .
I &apos;m making breakfast now .
Tom dropped Mary off at her friend &apos;s house .
I don &apos;t know that guy &apos;s name .
Tom usually eats lunch alone .
Tom asked me to do that very carefully .
My cat likes to look through the window .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about what other people think .
She isn &apos;t running .
This camera is Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;d be careful with that if I were you .
Tom shouldn &apos;t talk so much .
Tom has to do that before Monday .
I like women but I don &apos;t get along with them .
I &apos;ll take care of it .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary wants to go .
How old is he now ?
Is Tom Mary &apos;s son ?
I bought the same shirt as yours .
Do you have any more of these ?
We always take a bus .
I learned that from you .
Why do you want to do that ?
I don &apos;t think this is Tom &apos;s umbrella .
Mary and Alice look like sisters .
Why did Tom stop working here ?
He would rather go by train than by plane .
I won again .
Look up the word in the dictionary .
You know how they are .
Why are you so worried ?
This one &apos;s for me .
Tom asked for some money .
Tom wants to move to Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t really enjoy studying French .
This place is dangerous .
I am doing my best .
Everyone &apos;s laughing .
I think Tom would like that .
We had next to nothing in the kitchen .
Is this bag yours or his ?
Where was he going ?
I am to meet him there .
It may rain .
Please sit down on the sofa .
That &apos;s not a secret .
Who should I be afraid of ?
Tom is inside the house .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
What did Tom do this time ?
We don &apos;t have all day .
He is crazy about baseball .
They have very little to live on .
I &apos;m not even sure if this is my key .
I &apos;ll miss you while you &apos;re gone .
Tom and Mary are getting married in October .
Tom will be disappointed if you don &apos;t go to his party .
It was warm , so I opened the window .
I love coming to Boston .
We all wanted to know why Tom couldn &apos;t come .
How do you know how hard it is ?
This car is Tom &apos;s .
Many students bought the book .
I had fun here .
Tom was quite drunk .
I &apos;ll take care of it as soon as I can .
Can you lend me your dictionary ?
Tom kept the door open .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here , does he ?
You got what you wanted , didn &apos;t you ?
The meeting &apos;s about to start .
Tom stood in front of me .
He doesn &apos;t have a sister .
What are you planning to do after this is over ?
Tom got bored quickly .
I know that you don &apos;t like me .
Does Tom make you happy ?
We think that &apos;s a good thing .
We understand that .
I hate her now .
They were watching television .
I &apos;m so sorry for what I did .
Did you get their letter ?
He will come back in a few days .
Tom is upset .
It was here that I saw her .
Where &apos;s my wife ?
We don &apos;t have to watch this .
What time is dinner ?
Tom looked awake .
I go swimming once a week .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
Tom arrived after Mary left .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
I want you to tell me everything that happened .
Tom doesn &apos;t know for certain when Mary will come .
You must be back by 10 o &apos;clock .
Don &apos;t you want to see your room ?
That is her car .
I saw Tom and his dog in the park .
What are they doing in there ?
She is married to an American .
Why would I say anything ?
I thought you &apos;d ask about that .
When I came to , I found myself in the hospital .
I &apos;m not so sure this is such a good idea .
Would you please do me a favor ?
Could you tell me the way to the station , please ?
Tom wasn &apos;t even hurt .
I often play soccer after school .
I do not have anything in my bag .
I &apos;ve never heard you talk like that .
Is there something wrong ?
May I ask a favor of you ?
Tom decided to risk it all .
I like Tom , but he doesn &apos;t like me .
What could he mean ?
I probably should have said something .
He is now at the desk .
When was the last time I visited you ?
Thank you for being my friend .
I &apos;m sorry for what I &apos;ve done .
Take Tom with you .
This is all still new to me .
I meet new people every day .
She may be waiting at the station now .
I wish I could stop thinking about Tom .
I &apos;ll be glad to .
These flowers are from our garden .
We don &apos;t know him .
What &apos;s Tom do ?
I &apos;ve made a decision .
Why do I even care ?
I don &apos;t know anyone in Boston .
You have him there .
Let &apos;s go for a drink .
We don &apos;t have long .
I don &apos;t play tennis after school .
Tom says he &apos;ll come .
How did you know I was Canadian ?
Don &apos;t you ever say anything ?
I didn &apos;t drink the water .
If she were here now , I would tell her the truth .
How are you feeling today ?
Tom bought a new pair of shoes .
Tom knows what you said .
I hurt the same way you hurt .
I &apos;m all alone here .
I can &apos;t stand him .
I hope so .
I wrote this song for Tom .
It &apos;s dangerous to play around the fire .
A good book is the best of friends , the same today and forever .
There are still many things left to do .
Tom likes Boston better than any other place he &apos;s lived .
Do you really want to learn another language ?
Is this my life ?
I &apos;ll go by taxi .
They &apos;re in .
Tom had every right to be angry .
He &apos;s taller than me .
Tom is as tall as I am .
I know something about it .
Tom hates Mary , but not as much as she hates him .
How did this all start ?
We want to thank you for coming .
I can &apos;t wait to visit my grandmother .
Tom is good at singing .
Tom and I love each other .
Where is your friend ?
Mary has pretty eyes .
I &apos;ll meet to you at eight .
I didn &apos;t ask for these .
I want you to come with me to see Tom .
The girl walked slowly .
Tom seemed better .
Everyone had a good year .
What would you like to drink ?
Tom looked a bit sick .
Here &apos;s what to do .
Tom isn &apos;t alone anymore .
Here comes the bus !
Is Tom here , too ?
What do they do there ?
Your father will be so proud of you .
Will it make a difference ?
Who &apos;s he ?
Tom seems to have lost his passport .
Do you know what Tom is doing now ?
I &apos;m older than Tom .
I went to her house , but she was not at home .
I don &apos;t want Tom to come .
Do you want to go to Boston with me ?
How far is it to the library from here ?
Did something happen at school today ?
It &apos;s a situation I would love to change .
Can you see anything out there ?
Where do you buy vegetables ?
I have to get out of here .
We &apos;ve run out of tea .
Why is Tom afraid of you ?
We should &apos;ve stayed till the end of the party .
We &apos;re here for you .
I wonder how this works .
It might rain .
It &apos;ll be very , very hot .
The movie hasn &apos;t started yet .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary &apos;s father was .
What &apos;s Boston like ?
No one knew about it .
Do I have to think of everything ?
I spent the whole weekend at home on the computer .
I &apos;m going to miss Boston .
She says that she is happy .
Tom took the bus to school .
What in the world got into you ?
That &apos;s up to you .
If anyone can do it , Tom can .
Who brought this ?
Tom came to visit us three days ago .
There &apos;s nothing there .
I don &apos;t want to buy anything .
How high is that mountain ?
I &apos;ve got to go now .
I feel very sorry about that .
This is a new experience for Tom .
No one listened to me .
Tom has more money in the bank than I do .
I knew you &apos;d like Tom .
You must do exactly what I tell you .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that Tom had a daughter ?
It &apos;s my fault this has happened .
Tom asked me to help him with his homework .
It &apos;s not here .
It seems that I &apos;m not lucky today .
Let &apos;s open it .
This will pass .
Tom should take better care of his children .
I took off my hat .
I wish I were a little taller .
I told you not to call me at work .
Tom has gone to Australia .
How would you feel ?
Tom still has to tell Mary what to do .
I didn &apos;t see any children .
I &apos;m always on time .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s younger sister .
This is a large house .
What &apos;s this for ?
They were dead .
It was so dark that they could hardly see .
We don &apos;t belong here .
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not .
He has money , but he &apos;s not happy .
Tom knows that Mary loves John .
I can &apos;t speak French as well as Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
It just doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom wasn &apos;t hungry .
Why did they fire Tom ?
Tom says he &apos;ll do whatever we do .
This is your problem .
What do you like the most about Tom ?
I &apos;m on your side , Tom .
If you don &apos;t want to do that , it &apos;s OK .
Here &apos;s some more tea .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t living in Boston anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t even understand it himself .
Those two don &apos;t get along .
We study music .
Tom sat on the couch .
You shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much ice cream .
There is no answer to your question .
I really do want to help Tom .
I should &apos;ve left the gun where I found it .
Tom said Mary is often late .
I know what to do .
Is this your pencil ?
I &apos;d like to ask Tom that myself .
Were you home at ten ?
I think Tom is fine .
I can &apos;t find the restaurant .
I think she &apos;s innocent .
Tom sat next to Mary on the bus .
Can we leave now ?
I &apos;d like to go to the movies .
She stood up and walked to the window .
At first , I thought he was your brother .
Give me a few .
Tom says he &apos;s not coming .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s on Monday .
I hid it somewhere .
Tom is eating ice cream .
We &apos;re all done .
You don &apos;t have enough experience .
I &apos;m sure of his success .
You found me where no one else was looking .
It was not until yesterday that I heard about the accident .
The car moved very slowly .
I can &apos;t come tomorrow .
I don &apos;t care what you say . It &apos;s not going to happen !
He thinks I &apos;m in love with her .
I &apos;ll spend Christmas with my family .
He wanted to meet me .
Can &apos;t you leave me alone ?
I &apos;d love to stay .
Tom put down his suitcase .
I shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
Where did you learn all that ?
I do not watch television .
No one is coming .
Today , I am feeling a lot better .
I have known her for two years .
If it were not for the sun , we could not live .
That &apos;s not for you .
I didn &apos;t know anyone in the room .
Tom and Mary went to Boston with their children last weekend .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t swim .
No one says that .
Do you like this city ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even know your name .
That &apos;s not how the world works .
We won .
He &apos;s big and strong .
Give me five days .
Tom will never stop .
Tom kept me waiting for a long time .
Tom is like a brother to me .
She makes a good living .
What do you want to give Tom ?
It &apos;s far from over .
I need someone to hold me .
We don &apos;t have a car .
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for his advice .
What &apos;s this dog &apos;s name ?
You &apos;ll do whatever I say .
I tried to save you .
You should help your father .
He did not want her to leave .
Tom found out our secret .
I want to write a book .
I think Tom is expecting us both .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
He will tell me everything sooner or later .
We don &apos;t have any rules .
What car did he take ?
That problem is too simple .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
We went on foot .
The reason is very simple .
What he said is true in a sense .
Tom is the one who wants to wait .
What else do you want to know ?
Let &apos;s go back to the office .
Why &apos;s Tom going to Boston ?
Tom says that he needs to talk to you .
Tom said that he was innocent .
This book can &apos;t go into the bag .
You may take my word for it .
I usually go to school by bus .
Let me ask you something .
Come in , the door &apos;s open .
You are twice as strong as I am .
What are you doing out there ?
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
I can &apos;t get in touch with Tom .
That &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
We have had a lot of snow this winter .
I think Tom knows why .
I love it .
Why is everyone looking at us ?
He came after you left .
You can &apos;t give Tom that .
Tom says he &apos;ll come at once .
As soon as Tom finished work , he went home .
Tom can do better than that , I think .
I cannot tell you everything that happened to me yesterday .
This is the medicine I was telling you about .
When Tom was young , he ate three eggs every day .
How is the family doing ?
I &apos;m not too happy .
They say that he &apos;s very rich .
Take a look .
He didn &apos;t give an answer to the question .
It seems that Tom can &apos;t swim .
I can &apos;t study at home .
I was surprised Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
That &apos;s all I have to say .
What is it that you want ?
Tom is thinking about it .
They &apos;re having a break at the moment .
Tom makes his own bed every morning .
I &apos;m in the hospital .
Is it that hard ?
Tom will be ready .
My homework was finally finished .
I have a plan . Don &apos;t worry .
Tell Tom he has to do that today .
I have no idea what Tom said .
Are you brothers ?
Tom will be back at 2 : 30 .
We need to find someone who can take care of this problem .
Tom put a cup of coffee down in front of Mary .
Tom asked for my advice .
What are we going to do about Tom ?
You are as tall as my sister .
I want to make Tom happy .
I wish I could speak French half as well as you do .
What was the first song you ever wrote ?
I &apos;m glad that the rain has stopped .
My bag was stolen .
Do you know what she said ?
What makes you happy , Tom ?
He did not come back before ten o &apos;clock .
Take a walk every day .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary , but he wasn &apos;t sure if she wanted him to kiss her .
Maybe she forgot my birthday .
I don &apos;t like the house he is living in .
You ought not to say such a thing .
I think I &apos;ll be leaving .
I can &apos;t eat any more .
How is it possible ?
I think that Tom is kind .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Nobody wants to talk about that .
You don &apos;t have to say anything if you don &apos;t feel like it .
Tom lost his friends .
Are you afraid of a little girl ?
Tom has an uncle who works in Australia .
I &apos;m not fat .
Tom has been watching TV all day .
You &apos;re a good French speaker .
Who &apos;s that boy standing at the door ?
This hat is too small for me .
Tom was abroad .
Why don &apos;t you go talk to him ?
Can you play a song for me ?
Don &apos;t you think I know ?
I &apos;d like to hear that song again .
Tom came to ask us for our help .
He has no bicycle .
She came all the way from New York to see me .
My watch says 2 : 30 .
Did Tom talk to you ?
Why wait until Monday ?
Do you want to be my girlfriend ?
You won &apos;t be on your own .
It took Tom almost three hours to get home .
They &apos;re after us .
I &apos;m sure that she has arrived at the village by now .
You must not go out after dinner .
I &apos;m about to die .
It was worth a shot .
We enjoy watching TV .
Tom goes to school with my son .
We should try harder .
What &apos;re you good at ?
This bed is too hard to sleep in .
Why weren &apos;t you here yesterday ?
Go back to your work .
We &apos;re surprised .
There isn &apos;t much money in this business .
I almost forgot to do that .
We love Tom .
What do you expect from us ?
When Tom is at home , he doesn &apos;t want to talk about work .
Can you walk ?
I brought some pizza .
He drives very fast .
I got you this .
This problem is too difficult for me to solve .
He caught a big fish .
I live with Tom .
I couldn &apos;t remember ever having met her .
I often go to the beach .
I cannot cook as well as my mother does .
I can &apos;t drive Tom to school today .
We have to have this .
I know it &apos;s not easy .
You &apos;ve tried .
I wish I were rich .
You &apos;re standing in my way .
I don &apos;t want to go to jail .
This is the house where he lives .
I will never change my mind .
What are you doing , Tom ?
I visited Tom .
She is a little shy .
We have to fix this .
We won &apos;t forget .
Tom is thinking .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s friend .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go .
He looks young .
I really liked your story .
Tom won &apos;t be able to do that that soon .
I have no friends .
I go every year .
It is never too late to learn .
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom alone .
I want to be here for Tom .
Tom couldn &apos;t wait to get home .
This is a very good tea .
I have nothing to say .
Tom couldn &apos;t make up his mind .
She always keeps her word .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom is Mary &apos;s son .
I said there &apos;s no one here .
How did you meet your husband ?
I will tell him about it when he comes next time .
I should &apos;ve listened to my father .
I wish I were in Boston .
If you could do it , would you do it ?
That &apos;s quite a story .
I want some tea without sugar .
Tom and I got married in Boston three years ago .
She is rather poor at tennis .
Tom closed the door behind himself .
You aren &apos;t allowed to do that .
What more do you want , Tom ?
I &apos;d like a book .
Do you know what color she likes ?
There is nothing to apologize for .
We can talk about it later .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thought .
I &apos;m a student here .
The boy has a watch in his hand .
All is well .
Who is already awake ?
I was hardly able to see it .
I thought Tom was in Australia .
I &apos;ve made Tom angry .
Why don &apos;t you come in ?
How often do you eat out ?
I couldn &apos;t catch the train .
You won &apos;t believe it .
We have enough room for everyone .
What is she doing in his office ?
Who do you guys work for ?
How did Tom convince Mary to marry him ?
Someone has been in my room .
He hurt her feelings on purpose .
Tom had no right to do what he did .
I &apos;ve got Tom &apos;s address somewhere on my computer .
Tom went away .
How did you know Tom was here ?
Tom wanted money .
How do you know that , Tom ?
You &apos;re really funny .
I never said anything like that .
I &apos;m going to read some other books .
I love being with you .
I would like to see your mother .
Could you please be quiet ?
You must certainly be very hungry now .
I believe it &apos;s finished .
The girl I went to the movies with is a friend of mine .
I was new .
Tom would never do that .
You &apos;d make a good lawyer .
When do you leave for school ?
Most students don &apos;t like homework .
You can have this .
He &apos;s very ill .
I know that this is the beginning of the end .
Where can I rent a bike ?
Which color do you think Tom will like better ?
Tom arrived at the hotel .
How long &apos;ll that take ?
I made my decision .
I was just scared .
Tom said that Mary wouldn &apos;t be mad .
Tom knows exactly what kind of person Mary is .
What kind of question is that , Tom ?
Do it for Tom .
I hope that this isn &apos;t a mistake .
How come you don &apos;t do that ?
I had no idea that Tom knew how to speak French .
Did you know that ?
Tom quickly got dressed .
I &apos;ll call Tom .
You should &apos;ve listened to me .
Tom came into my room .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
How about I do that ?
I wonder where your brother has gone to .
People like me .
What are you and Tom doing ?
How about going to see a movie with me ?
When does Tom get here ?
Tom has been rather busy recently .
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy , does he ?
I &apos;m not going to make it there on time .
Tom kept quite calm .
We &apos;re very proud of you .
Nobody lied .
We had a lot of fun together today , didn &apos;t we ?
He will come this afternoon .
Tom watched the boys swimming .
I will never see him .
Tom wants to go to Boston .
This bed is too hard to sleep on .
That didn &apos;t use to happen .
I &apos;ll phone again later .
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school .
I saw that movie three years ago .
Tom looked very young .
I hope that you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
What did Tom say about me ?
I &apos;ll give you a call tomorrow .
Where will you be ?
This is my friend , Tom .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll take long .
Would you mind if I kissed you ?
We should do this again .
You must stay with me .
Tom and Mary are often together .
I &apos;ll know tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t seem willing to help .
The meeting finished thirty minutes ago .
We &apos;re going to miss you .
Tom was honest .
It &apos;s a good day for going to the park .
Some people believe they can become rich without having to work .
I see nothing wrong with it .
You &apos;d better not go there again .
This is how we cook rice .
How old is your little sister ?
Where is my pencil ?
It &apos;s very kind of you to help me .
I actually did that yesterday .
Mary broke up with me .
I fell asleep while reading .
The kids are at school .
I &apos;ve quit drinking beer .
Tom can help us .
Where are you going , Tom ?
Mary is my girlfriend .
I want to eat pizza tonight .
He has money .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom .
Tom has more money than Mary .
Are you interested in the job ?
Tom came home .
Where &apos;s my lunch ?
You should do that right away .
I went to bed later than usual last night .
I found them .
He did a pretty good job .
Can you speak French well ?
I will make her happy .
Thank you for the book .
You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
They are my old friends .
Tom will be missed .
I can hardly believe it .
I remember seeing her before .
I &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
I just told you something I &apos;ve never told anyone else .
Everyone was satisfied .
I would like to talk with you again .
We don &apos;t have that long .
Why do you think Tom likes it ?
Why don &apos;t you explain that ?
What &apos;s the name of the man who was talking to you ?
You came just in time .
Everything &apos;s fine .
You are not to blame for the accident .
No one asked any questions .
She was more beautiful than all of the others .
Tom is about my age .
I hardly even know you .
That would really make me happy .
I &apos;m taking you with me .
Do you want some more tea ?
Did you eat something last night ?
I need to apologize to Tom .
Maybe I &apos;ll come to Boston again next year at this time .
Mary said Tom was in trouble .
Let &apos;s give it to Tom .
Tom seems lonely .
This is my plan .
We usually call him Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t rich .
Do you want to do that again ?
Where did you go to school ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary .
Let &apos;s rent a bike there .
We have plans to visit Boston .
I was stupid enough to believe it .
I haven &apos;t felt well recently .
You have a beautiful sister .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll do that .
When do we arrive ?
Maybe that won &apos;t be necessary .
I don &apos;t like cats very much .
I would like a glass of water .
Tom took some things out of his bag .
That &apos;s how Tom likes it .
Who gave you that ?
Tom had nothing to do .
I could do that in my sleep .
Tom did it himself .
I am bored .
Tom doesn &apos;t like eating vegetables .
When was the last time you got drunk ?
Tom met Mary for breakfast .
I &apos;m on my way .
We know you &apos;re there .
My mother gets up earlier than I do .
Tell him to wait .
Tom looks happy today .
Would you mind telling me what this is about ?
We love what we do .
Tom met Mary three years ago .
Tom is at home taking care of the kids .
I don &apos;t like it when it &apos;s very hot .
Why is she doing this ?
I only have a few books .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be married to Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t your name , is it ?
I &apos;m here because of Tom .
I am sad to hear it .
Why is this happening to me ?
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time .
Is there anything else we need to do ?
You like him , don &apos;t you ?
I have no money today .
We live in the United States .
Are you through with this book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends to play with .
Who do you have to do that with ?
He knows how to swim .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what Mary has done .
Tom wanted to eat the whole cake .
What more do you need ?
I &apos;ll stay at my sister &apos;s place .
Tom knows why nobody came to his party .
Nobody can help you .
A cat was on the table .
It sure is hot .
I heard her singing in her room .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he has to do .
It &apos;s great to be here in Boston .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t sorry .
We have to start .
I just want to be left alone .
Please come and see me again .
&quot; Do you know why Tom doesn &apos;t want to go shopping with me ? &quot; &quot; I think he doesn &apos;t like shopping . &quot;
I &apos;m very sorry I did that .
This book is yours .
The concert wasn &apos;t all that great .
I don &apos;t know what to say about that .
You &apos;re not allowed to carry food into the library .
That doesn &apos;t belong to us .
Tom isn &apos;t married .
Why aren &apos;t you with Tom ?
Do you have time ?
We &apos;ve got to do something .
Tom will let Mary decide .
This one &apos;s OK .
Don &apos;t worry about your family .
Please go .
I sure wish I could speak French better .
That &apos;s no problem .
We have no school tomorrow .
I &apos;m talking to one of my students .
Why won &apos;t you just leave me alone ?
I &apos;m not in any pain .
Tom drank way too much last night .
He was busy with his homework .
I saw him first .
I &apos;ve started learning French .
Your proposal sounds good .
&quot; Have you seen Tom today ? &quot; &quot; No , I haven &apos;t . &quot;
It &apos;s so quiet .
Tom said that somebody here needed help .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that for Mary .
I will be back in less than five minutes .
It makes my mouth water .
I hope that &apos;s true .
How much is this camera ?
I hope he &apos;ll be able to come ! I &apos;d like to see him .
I can &apos;t find a thing .
Just be glad Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary what you really thought of her .
I didn &apos;t want this to happen .
Where does she want to go ?
I told Tom that I was busy .
Tom looked again .
That &apos;s the building where my dad works .
I &apos;ve just talked to Tom .
Why didn &apos;t you listen to me ?
You remember Tom and Mary , don &apos;t you ?
This isn &apos;t good for Tom .
Is this your umbrella ?
Tom is still there , waiting for you .
I won !
You can &apos;t believe a word he says .
It &apos;s business .
Keep the dog out .
Tom is not happy about it .
You know we love you .
Who is the father ?
Look at it .
Don &apos;t give this to anybody .
Tom knows what Mary wants .
This wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Who did you get this from ?
He gets mad very easily .
He has been to America .
Can &apos;t we just go home ?
I &apos;m going to tell Tom the truth .
It &apos;ll be hot .
Do you think you &apos;re up to it ?
Your dog is very big .
Tom told me what happened .
Is it a good play ?
&quot; Are you tired ? &quot; &quot; No , not at all . &quot;
The cat is under the sofa .
Tom let me drive his car .
This came for you .
He likes listening to the radio .
No one could see us .
That book is old .
Tom told me I could use his car .
How badly was Tom injured ?
I &apos;ve never taught anyone anything .
That &apos;s the way Tom always does it .
I was home all night .
Tom must &apos;ve seen Mary there .
This is Tom &apos;s computer .
Tom , what would you like to have for dinner ?
What &apos;s it really worth ?
Tell Tom what &apos;s wrong .
I have a friend living in Boston .
Tom is the one with a car .
You should learn how to use your dictionary .
How &apos;s that possible ?
We need to get to the airport .
Some people say French is easy to learn .
Let me explain .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to study French .
Tom and I want to study French .
You live and learn .
We missed our train .
I should not have bought such a thing .
I really like you a lot .
Why is Tom so busy ?
I hope you know that .
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report ?
Tom is here with us .
Get to the point .
I &apos;ve got something .
We have a lot of snow in the winter .
I went for a walk in the park .
Do you know what this says ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t wait for Mary for more than ten minutes .
I no longer study French .
Tell Tom where we &apos;re going .
Tom got married .
Tom is not happy about this .
Tom didn &apos;t want to help us today .
My dad &apos;s name is Tom .
I wasn &apos;t the only person Tom talked to .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to eat much .
What do you love ? What don &apos;t you love ?
My father asked me to open the window .
Tom put his shirt on .
I hope that Tom does that .
Tom was convinced that he &apos;d be able to win .
I prefer not to talk about it .
I shouldn &apos;t have been driving .
Is Tom right ?
I want to take a break .
Why do you like Boston ?
Let &apos;s not forget about what Tom said .
Tom got better .
Tom was tired .
We must not do that .
You &apos;re confused .
I owe you something .
I can &apos;t explain that either .
I can &apos;t see it .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what Tom wants or not .
I &apos;ll go find out where Tom is .
Turn in your homework .
She likes these cats .
It was just the beginning .
I have read the book .
Tom wants to talk to you .
You are my father .
Do you mind if I ask you a question ?
He found it .
This is just the beginning .
I expect Tom will know what to do .
Tom thinks he knows what to do .
Tom looks awake .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not going to be that easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Many people only speak one language .
The store will be closed tomorrow .
He &apos;s new in town .
Let me handle this .
I do it because I have to .
I think we need to have a talk .
I think we need to talk .
I don &apos;t know what we will do .
I don &apos;t know what you think .
Tom told Mary it wouldn &apos;t be easy .
Maybe you &apos;d better go get Tom .
I wish you had been there .
I don &apos;t think Tom lives here .
I asked where he had been .
The United States is a large country .
Tom almost never wears a hat .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where his keys are .
I don &apos;t need them anymore .
I think Tom already knows .
He has no money .
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak English .
I &apos;ll come back soon .
We don &apos;t sing that song anymore .
Tom never visited me in prison .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault .
I wonder what Tom and Mary have in common .
Tom left Australia three years ago .
Will doing this make a difference ?
You may borrow my car .
You know why , don &apos;t you ?
You made it .
Tom decided to buy a new computer .
You don &apos;t have to go to school on Sunday .
Tom comes from a big family .
What are you doing in Boston ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have time right now to do that .
My wife thinks I &apos;m crazy .
Tom is too young to drink beer .
When did you learn to swim ?
I &apos;m getting to it .
He used to read a lot .
What time does the ship leave ?
I always walk to school .
That really hurts .
My parents don &apos;t know where I am .
I &apos;ll be right with you .
How come you didn &apos;t call me last night ?
Whose newspaper is this ?
I am interested in this story .
How many times do I have to explain this to you ?
I totally agree with you .
I &apos;d do it .
I brought mine . Did you bring yours ?
No one ate anything .
That &apos;s right !
Tom won &apos;t like you .
It &apos;s your decision , Tom .
Tom and Mary want to see you .
I wish the rain would stop .
Don &apos;t you want me to be happy ?
Tell Tom he should do that .
Tom saved Mary a seat .
I &apos;ll go let Tom know .
The girl caught a small fish .
What do you guys want ?
Do you want to help me ?
I can &apos;t put up with the noise .
Look how happy Tom is .
I was too surprised to speak .
You must tell me .
Tom is at home .
I want to live .
Tom needs to do that next .
She has a few books .
We are going to leave tomorrow .
You shouldn &apos;t have brought Tom with you .
Why do you want to study abroad ?
She says that she likes flowers .
He used to say so , but now he doesn &apos;t .
How many languages do you speak ?
Can you please be quiet ?
I love my daughter .
Tom got up .
We &apos;ll never make it .
Tom had other things he needed to do .
Tom said that &apos;s what he wants to do .
Tom says that he can &apos;t eat any more .
You can have either of these , but not both .
The children are already tired .
Is Tom coming here ?
Please call me Tom .
No one can help us .
Tom asked Mary whether she liked him .
I &apos;m able to run .
Why didn &apos;t I think of that ?
It &apos;s good to be home .
No one goes there anymore .
Tom held the door open for Mary .
You &apos;re not going to tell my parents , are you ?
I want Tom to know that .
He gets along very well with his friends .
Tom &apos;s birthday was yesterday .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother ?
Did Tom give it to you ?
You &apos;re going to be OK .
I didn &apos;t have to study yesterday .
He did it as he had been told .
I expected Tom to be there .
Tom almost started to cry .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
Tom asked me to leave the room .
Why don &apos;t you want to do this ?
Why are they crying ?
I just wanted to make you proud .
I wish I &apos;d met her .
Tom never told me where he lived .
I &apos;m your brother .
I don &apos;t understand a word of what he says .
We have a little problem .
Look what they &apos;re doing .
What did you just say ?
Tom showed me his phone .
Tom saw me .
Tom , I need to tell you something .
I can come .
Don &apos;t you like baseball ?
Tom stopped in front of Mary &apos;s house and got out of his car .
Do you think I &apos;m happy ?
You can easily find the bank .
I don &apos;t want to talk about the weather .
Tom rarely wears a tie .
You hurt him .
Tom came to see us yesterday .
She knows me .
Someone might get hurt .
I study many languages .
I study French at school .
I &apos;d like to apologize .
I &apos;ll meet you there in an hour .
Tom said that he thought that he knew what the problem was .
Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Go to school .
We don &apos;t speak French .
Those children have no one to care for them .
I hate Tom &apos;s parents .
Everybody at school knows your name .
Tom fell asleep right away .
My father has been in the hospital for two months .
I &apos;ll be back in a couple minutes .
I know how busy you &apos;re likely to be tomorrow .
She &apos;s not as beautiful as her sister .
She was born in America .
Did Tom give you that ?
Everything looks good .
Don &apos;t let Tom go outside today .
Tom , are all these books yours ?
He does not know how to solve the problem .
Tom , are you there ?
How long do I have to wait ?
Tom wanted his son to live in the city .
Who is able to explain this to me ?
Just what exactly are you trying to say ?
I like to go to school .
Is there a telephone here ?
Just because you &apos;re my girlfriend doesn &apos;t mean I have to agree with you .
Tom has lost his interest in studying French .
Do you know how to use this machine ?
She may have missed the train .
Will you write your name here ?
We don &apos;t know the truth yet .
Is that new ?
Tom expected more .
Where were they born ?
There &apos;s no one home .
Was Tom on your team ?
We &apos;ve already talked about this .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t need to know about this .
Tom got hurt .
Tom kept going .
It is necessary for you to help her .
Don &apos;t play with fire .
My father is very nice .
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to read .
I noticed that , too .
Where do you want to go today ?
Who told you I was Canadian ?
I cannot lend this book to you .
I &apos;d like you to come with me .
There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
I have many friends in foreign countries .
I thought you &apos;d be happy for Tom .
Are you short ?
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom hadn &apos;t done that ?
Let &apos;s live here .
I wanted to buy the book .
Tom can &apos;t be too far behind us .
Tom was suddenly very happy .
Tom turned the music off .
He used to drink .
Tom eats too fast .
I went to the station .
Tell her that I am waiting for her .
I plan to never drink again .
Here are our books .
I &apos;m not going to give up .
I must help him .
When did you begin learning French ?
I &apos;m healthy .
I thought doing this would be easy .
Whose friend is he ?
Did you see a doctor ?
It &apos;s a good plan .
I wrote it myself .
Do you have a minute ?
I &apos;ll call you back later .
We &apos;re doing great .
Thank you for doing this .
They have wine .
I just have a few questions for you .
I &apos;m doing this for my family .
Tom learned a new word .
He is still in bed .
That &apos;s my idea .
Is this a bad time to visit ?
We haven &apos;t got much time .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to do that .
She believes whatever he says .
I can see some people walking across the street .
We &apos;re all proud of you .
What do you think ?
Maybe they can be happy .
We still want to help you .
I didn &apos;t have time for that .
That looks good on you .
It seemed that there was no one in the village .
How can I get in touch with you ?
The reason doesn &apos;t matter .
I think I &apos;ve seen enough .
We &apos;re all very worried about you .
Is it OK if I kiss you ?
Tom still has feelings for you .
Tom can do just about anything .
I already feel much better .
I take my job seriously .
He can &apos;t afford a new car .
You have no heart .
What does he say ?
Tom quickly lost interest .
When did you buy your car ?
I wouldn &apos;t want to lose my job .
They &apos;ve been at it for hours .
You seemed to enjoy doing that .
You &apos;ve got to stop Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t lonely anymore .
You don &apos;t have to say a word .
I &apos;m thirty .
It &apos;ll be OK .
Why not take a few days off ?
He is afraid of his father .
Aren &apos;t these your books ?
I never drink .
It is said that he was very rich .
She is not honest at all .
Perhaps Tom will do that , too .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t believe me .
He will soon be a father .
Tom looks sick .
You look surprised .
Do you still want me to give Tom your old computer ?
Tom and Mary want to see us .
You &apos;ll find this book very interesting .
That &apos;s dangerous .
We don &apos;t like it .
Let me take a look at your driver &apos;s license .
That &apos;s not so important .
Tom has long hair and wears glasses .
Let go of my arm !
Everyone is waiting for Tom to say something .
Tom looked up .
Tom has waited for three hours .
It &apos;s time for bed .
Do any of you have a pencil ?
I wouldn &apos;t blame them .
I &apos;m getting old .
If I had known , I would not have come .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
You can count on me .
I don &apos;t believe him at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t appreciate what Mary did .
In the future , you have to get here on time .
I don &apos;t want to get involved in that business .
I love flowers .
I want to speak in French .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
I hope Tom &apos;s right .
Is she your sister ?
They will come .
It was nice and warm inside the house .
Tom is out walking his dog .
That child has a very large head .
Tom &apos;s going to be a grandfather again .
I want to do it myself .
Tom is almost never busy anymore .
I don &apos;t understand them .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything .
Tom loved us .
I &apos;m two years younger than he is .
This is what I &apos;ve always wanted to do .
Go for it , Tom .
I was at Tom &apos;s place yesterday .
I &apos;ll walk home from here .
I understand French a little .
I &apos;ve been able to read since I was six years old .
He says he won &apos;t come .
Tom , you &apos;ll be here for me if I need you , won &apos;t you ?
I just wanted to ask a question .
Do you know why he wasn &apos;t at school ?
You &apos;re three hours late .
You gave it to me .
Tom couldn &apos;t stand being alone with Mary .
Tom wasn &apos;t crazy .
Come if you can .
I &apos;m not home .
I have no idea .
He wants to see if he &apos;s still got what it takes .
It seems to me that something &apos;s wrong .
Tom would often come to see me .
Tom and Mary think they know everything .
Tom didn &apos;t want anything to do with Mary .
What was their explanation ?
Don &apos;t forget about us !
Is it too big ?
Tom has a lot of things he has to do .
He isn &apos;t coming , either .
Tom and Mary told John .
He &apos;s rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
He likes this guitar .
I &apos;m good .
Let &apos;s take a picture here .
Don &apos;t let the dog sleep in our bed .
Have you found anything ?
Tom didn &apos;t say anything .
You are to come with me .
You can &apos;t marry Tom .
Don &apos;t you know what this is ?
Tom is fine .
I know how important this is to you .
I don &apos;t want to know about this .
The paper is white .
Where &apos;s everyone else ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know my name .
He wants more .
Why don &apos;t you want me to tell anybody ?
I like it when Tom does that .
I &apos;m looking for a present for my mother .
One by one , the boys came to see what I was reading .
I &apos;ve never asked Tom to do anything .
Even though I &apos;ve studied French for a long time , I &apos;m still not very good at speaking it .
Come on home .
Is this the right train for Tokyo ?
I know about you .
It &apos;s not your problem , anyway .
You can &apos;t be serious ?
Tom told me Mary is in jail .
I was waiting for a taxi .
How did you enjoy the party ?
I saw nothing at all .
If you don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
Keep trying .
Will you help me for a minute ?
He asked for money .
I &apos;ve always done it that way .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me here , does he ?
I don &apos;t know how they do it .
What do they do here ?
That &apos;s really cute .
You must not talk to him .
She is happy .
Thank you for helping Tom .
Tom was very old .
I &apos;m afraid so .
I don &apos;t watch TV anymore .
Tom may be out .
I &apos;m glad you invited me .
Do you think I like this ?
Tom didn &apos;t know where Mary was .
His family is very large .
Tom gets tired easily .
Tom wants to buy a new car .
Tom was not surprised by what he read in the report .
&quot; Not everyone can come to our party . &quot; &quot; Who &apos;s not coming ? &quot;
I can &apos;t believe you came here alone .
I didn &apos;t see him .
I &apos;ve already read this book .
When do I get what I want ?
We &apos;re working .
I &apos;m going on a run .
I don &apos;t live here anymore .
I like girls .
We have already finished our dinner .
I wonder why Tom is tired .
I lost everything .
You need to leave .
The baby cannot walk yet .
That is my dog .
I have a lot of problems to solve .
Do you want any ?
Tom is the only man that Mary has ever loved .
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying .
I am happy to meet you .
You must do as I tell you .
How long did you stay in Germany ?
They say Tom is gone .
Tom fell asleep before Mary got home .
It is going to rain this afternoon .
I have one question .
You must take care of Tom .
Tom told me that he &apos;s cold .
He told me to meet him at the restaurant .
Tom is going to be staying here with us for three months .
Would you do this for me ?
He &apos;s crazy about soccer .
We &apos;re not going to do that .
You shouldn &apos;t talk here .
I &apos;ve promised Tom I wouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
It &apos;s impossible that she knew about it .
Tom only spent three dollars for his lunch .
Tom goes to school with Mary .
I don &apos;t know what more I can say .
I &apos;m a lot taller than Tom .
She cannot stop it .
What do you think he meant by that ?
Why don &apos;t you ask me what you really want to know ?
I played tennis .
I work here .
Tom said he was going to try to help us .
She dropped in at my house yesterday .
I already called him .
It never happened .
Tom and Mary love each other .
Tom made Mary wait for a long time .
Do you know anything about Tom &apos;s parents ?
Let &apos;s go out and eat dinner together from time to time .
I stayed up all night .
Keep writing .
Did you come here to help me or not ?
I want to spend more time with my family .
She doesn &apos;t always come late .
Tom promised Mary that he &apos;d never leave her .
I need to feed the dog .
He is my type !
Tom usually wears a tie at work .
He doesn &apos;t speak our language .
It &apos;s Monday .
Don &apos;t forget to tell Tom .
Tom gave up too soon .
She &apos;s six years older than me .
It has to be true .
What I &apos;m about to say will answer your question .
I couldn &apos;t help it .
Thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
I &apos;m giving it to you .
I should tell Tom to try it .
It &apos;s correct .
Someone is looking at me .
How are your parents ?
I should &apos;ve been there sooner .
Does Tom have a big family ?
You &apos;re late .
Tom was in the hospital for three weeks .
Why are you asking me ?
She plays the guitar .
He comes to see me once in a while .
I live in this house by myself .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel like going .
What do you guys have ?
Has Tom changed much ?
He showed me the way to the station .
What do you say to driving to the lake ?
Tom never told Mary about John .
He believes whatever I say .
I &apos;ll give you something .
Are you sure that this isn &apos;t true ?
I sold a book .
Tom taught me a lot of things .
There &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
Maybe I shouldn &apos;t have come .
I can &apos;t tell you the reason why I did that .
I can &apos;t go .
Tom soon fell asleep .
Tom bought Mary a nice present .
I thought you might ask that .
Who do you talk to ?
It would be great if we could meet again .
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do .
It was very cold yesterday , so I stayed at home .
Tom found his key under the sofa .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do if he were me .
She told him a joke , but he didn &apos;t laugh .
Do you want me to do that ?
Tom took my car .
I need the truth .
You need to do exactly what I tell you .
I don &apos;t want to lose you .
This isn &apos;t about money .
Tom laughed , but no one else did .
You don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
Most people think so .
The news broke his heart .
Both of us are from Australia .
We &apos;re expecting Tom to be here soon .
Tom spent a lot of time with Mary .
Would you like something to eat ?
Tom said that &apos;s fine with him .
The truth is that I don &apos;t really love you anymore .
I wish I were in Paris now .
He must be crazy to say such a thing .
Tom was at home .
We could sing together .
Tom looked a bit confused .
I don &apos;t believe anyone anymore .
You &apos;re absolutely right .
He won &apos;t live a long life .
What more is there ?
You can expect me tomorrow .
Tom &apos;ll succeed .
I laughed .
That is all .
What happened out here ?
Was Tom sleeping ?
You can &apos;t live on that island .
They don &apos;t have a chance .
It could happen to anybody .
We all had the same idea .
Tom knows more .
He has made me what I am today .
Tom was in Boston last week .
Is your wife tall ?
Tom has a lot of friends to help him .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
Tom is afraid he &apos;ll get fired .
Tom didn &apos;t even try to understand .
Tom was surprised to hear Mary had gotten married .
Do you think Tom would enjoy doing that ?
I should visit Tom .
It &apos;s too soon to joke about it .
I know her by name .
I can hardly believe you &apos;re here .
A cat is lying in the sun .
Are you feeling OK ?
This isn &apos;t safe .
How do you help someone who doesn &apos;t want your help ?
That &apos;s a really big apple .
I never was shy .
That &apos;s your answer for everything , isn &apos;t it ?
He told the truth .
What a country !
I was barely able to work .
That wouldn &apos;t be too difficult .
Put the book there .
Tom knows that Mary can &apos;t speak French .
I think you &apos;ve hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
Today I have a lot of things to do .
I can &apos;t speak French .
If you want , you can go .
I &apos;ve lost interest in golf .
He usually gets up at six .
I &apos;ll wait .
I wonder where Tom has gone .
My birthday is one month from today .
America is very large .
I had no idea what to do .
The summer is over .
You will get fat if you eat too much .
Tom &apos;s apartment is small .
How long did you sleep last night ?
Most people don &apos;t enjoy this .
I want to know who &apos;s coming with us .
I &apos;d like to call him . Do you have his phone number ?
Tom was watching TV .
We want to live here .
Where do you want me to put this ?
I can go .
That &apos;s no longer possible .
You don &apos;t have to stay to the end .
I speak French to my father and English to my mother .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s office .
What does he intend to do ?
Tom and Mary both died in the accident .
Who &apos;s after you ?
I &apos;m going to play tennis this evening .
You don &apos;t know how much I love you .
He said , &quot; Let &apos;s take a walk along the river . &quot;
Tom told me you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
Do you remember who I am ?
We need to know .
You should &apos;ve done it .
Where are they taking Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good choice .
Tom hardly smiled .
You look nervous .
I like Tom &apos;s voice .
What kind of books do you like ?
There &apos;s something I want you to see .
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be .
She can play tennis very well , but I can play just about as well as she can .
Please don &apos;t worry about me .
Tom thinks he &apos;s a good person .
Do you think I &apos;m happy about this ?
Tom does everything well .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t lend you my car next weekend .
We call him Tom .
I just want a little more sleep .
They &apos;ll find me .
He spoke very well .
I wonder if you might be able to help me .
I &apos;m going to swim every day .
Tom just taught me that song .
I don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going .
I thought you &apos;d like to see this .
Tom entered the room .
What do you want to do ?
Not everyone &apos;s like you .
Tom gave me this .
What will you do with your money ?
I want you to leave my house .
We haven &apos;t known each other long .
I asked my friend for advice .
How much did you win ?
I read a book today .
He &apos;ll be here any moment .
I don &apos;t speak your language .
The box was almost full .
How did you find me ?
I spoke with Tom today .
What good do you think that &apos;ll do ?
I think I know why you &apos;re here .
Tom isn &apos;t studying French now .
I &apos;d rather take the bus .
You have a good plan .
I haven &apos;t been drinking .
French is spoken in France .
Tom isn &apos;t that much taller than Mary .
He &apos;s kind of shy .
I feel like going to the movies , but I still have to do my homework .
Tom will arrive in Boston tomorrow morning .
Could you do me a big favor ?
How is Tom now ?
This car is as big as that car .
It was dark .
What does Tom have to say ?
Tom , I &apos;m happy for you .
She was on her way to school .
I &apos;d like to live in New York .
You must have a reason for telling me .
There is not much I can do to help , I am afraid .
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon .
How did you come by these books ?
Tom isn &apos;t married anymore .
The boy came back .
Do you want to read ?
We know who you are .
Why do you do that ?
I &apos;m very tired .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know that Mary was able to speak French .
I thought you &apos;d ask that .
He comes to see me nearly every day .
The whole class was quiet .
I had to go back to Boston .
I wasn &apos;t a bit tired .
They play ball in the park every afternoon .
Mary is very pretty .
Will he ever do it ?
How long do you think it &apos;ll take ?
Tom said he was afraid to do that .
There &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
Is she your mother ?
No one knows the reason .
Tom will never make it .
I want it .
Have you guys seen Tom ?
I just want to be certain that it &apos;s OK .
Why did you leave ?
He hasn &apos;t done anything .
He &apos;s working on it .
Tom isn &apos;t here yet , but we expect him soon .
I do it because I want to .
Are you sure you want to do that ?
Can you see that ?
I don &apos;t want to be the one to tell Tom that .
Why don &apos;t you just leave me alone ?
Bring me the newspaper .
I know some of the boys .
I &apos;d like to study French .
Tom says he &apos;s looking for Mary .
I must buy some milk .
Which house do they live in ?
I didn &apos;t use to like wine , but now I like it a lot .
I don &apos;t think this is for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play the piano anymore .
Tom and Mary want a big family .
Tom gave Mary a bottle of wine .
Which do you like better , summer or winter ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that , does he ?
Tom came here last week .
You must be from Australia .
Is this your money ?
I can &apos;t stay here anymore .
Let &apos;s eat now .
They didn &apos;t even know how to write their own names .
I don &apos;t know his name .
Do you really think Tom is going to be there ?
Tom is taking a break , isn &apos;t he ?
This is our decision .
There she comes .
Why don &apos;t you go to Boston ?
Tom isn &apos;t that much older than Mary .
They do know what they &apos;re doing .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like Boston .
Tom says he &apos;s working very hard .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s father .
There is little milk left in the bottle .
Tom went back to bed .
She taught me how to swim .
I want you to keep your promise .
Go to the park .
Why won &apos;t you believe me ?
Do you feel better today ?
She took up his offer .
Tom &apos;s family loved me .
I &apos;m afraid I won &apos;t be able to have lunch with you today .
I was kind of surprised Tom said that .
You are not Japanese .
Can I have a bit more milk ?
It &apos;s no trouble at all .
You don &apos;t have to thank us .
I don &apos;t have that much money .
If you need help , just ask .
Tom stayed there .
We aren &apos;t going .
I see the girl is beautiful .
Tom knew he needed to leave town .
I know where I &apos;m going next .
It was love at first sight .
We took the enemy by surprise .
Tom and I have a daughter .
I wanted to give up .
What kind of play is it ?
What &apos;s in front of you ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of death .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure if he should kiss Mary or not , so he didn &apos;t .
The newspaper is by your side .
That bag looks expensive .
It was his decision .
Tom knows the answer .
Why didn &apos;t you show up at the party last night ?
Tom didn &apos;t have anything to say .
Tom is about your age .
Tom doesn &apos;t look very happy .
I just received your letter .
I can &apos;t live without him .
I don &apos;t like what we &apos;ve become .
Please be sure to let me know your new address soon .
She &apos;s two years older than him .
Tom has changed his name to John .
It &apos;s very hard to understand .
I give you my word .
Where &apos;s your school ?
She had gone to the concert that evening .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a cat .
I wish you had more time for me .
It &apos;s not this one .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
Tom is waiting .
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday .
You &apos;re not going to do that , are you ?
I do hope you &apos;ll succeed .
Everyone likes her .
What &apos;s it look like ?
I didn &apos;t expect you to get here so soon .
His mother is taking care of him .
Tom wanted me to drive .
You need to call the police immediately .
He and his friend sat on the bench .
What &apos;s your father do ?
Tom works fast .
We &apos;ll stop here for today .
Tom finished the work by himself .
Come tomorrow .
I can &apos;t speak to Tom .
Why can &apos;t I go with you ?
I thought we were out of coffee .
We &apos;re a little busy right now .
Tom didn &apos;t understand your joke .
Put your hands on the car .
Have you ever heard of such a thing ?
Why does Tom do things like that ?
He left the room .
It was very hot this afternoon .
The movie wasn &apos;t all that great .
I don &apos;t even know how to dance .
So what is everyone &apos;s problem ?
When may I go home ?
Are you sure about that ?
Tom wants to see us .
It &apos;s all over for us .
Tom found his glasses and put them on .
These books are my books .
I &apos;m only going to say this once .
Tom didn &apos;t look at the picture again .
If you &apos;d stop telling me not to be nervous , I probably wouldn &apos;t be so nervous .
Do you know where Tom has been the past three weeks ?
I went for a walk on the beach .
It made me think of Tom .
Would you like me to show you how to do that ?
Perhaps Tom is writing a letter .
Tom and Mary are both college students .
I thought Tom loved me .
I think we &apos;ve seen enough .
That is the same umbrella that I found on the bus .
He was young and innocent .
I &apos;m not very happy .
You know her .
I think that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;d do .
She came to like the house .
Tom never married .
Tom isn &apos;t coming today .
You &apos;re stupid .
How did you hit on that ?
He bought her a dog .
My mother can &apos;t attend .
Tom has never played golf .
Tom said that he thought that the room was too small .
I feel better than ever .
My dog is white .
Tom knows something that he &apos;s not telling us .
I knew what needed to be done .
Did Tom really help you ?
There &apos;s only one window in my room .
They went to the beach .
I turned to him for advice .
I &apos;m sure Tom &apos;s answer would &apos;ve been no .
He needed the money .
Tom wasn &apos;t eating .
When did it begin to rain ?
I thought that would be a great idea .
I know this has been hard for you .
Can you do this without any help ?
Tom must &apos;ve had a good reason for what he did .
I &apos;ve come to see you .
I &apos;ve just gotten home .
It &apos;s nearly impossible .
Tom almost died .
You should get yourself a new car now .
One must do one &apos;s best .
All I can think about is next month &apos;s vacation . I haven &apos;t been on one in so long .
I get the feeling you don &apos;t really want me to go .
Who are you talking with ?
He is something like his father .
He pretended to be sick .
We should &apos;ve bought another bottle of wine .
I only have one brother .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a car .
Some of my friends are going to the movies tomorrow .
Who else knows ?
You look fine .
We can talk about it .
Maybe he likes you .
Please feel free to use my dictionary .
He wasn &apos;t sleeping when I came home .
Tom got killed .
I must convince Tom .
I won &apos;t go to school tomorrow .
I am sure he &apos;ll tell you as soon as he comes .
It &apos;s Monday , you know .
Tom laughed at my joke .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is scared of me .
Thank you for asking this question .
Tom does like you .
I didn &apos;t think I would be lonely .
She left for Paris .
I shouldn &apos;t have brought this up .
This might not be enough .
Was Tom at home yesterday ?
I hope we can make it to your party .
It was already late , so I went back home .
Tom is always nice to everyone .
She couldn &apos;t understand what had happened there .
I don &apos;t know how to swim either .
Look at me when I talk to you !
We all know that Tom is guilty .
Are there any letters for me ?
Tom already ate .
Tom and I &apos;ll meet you there .
&quot; Mary is cute . &quot; &quot; So is Alice . &quot;
Tom invited Mary to dinner .
She &apos;s not young , is she ?
He has been to London three times .
He has something to do with the case .
Tom pretended he hadn &apos;t heard what Mary had said about him .
Tom can &apos;t seem to understand what Mary is trying to say .
Is your mother at home ?
Tom and Mary are laughing .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where he should go .
I stayed home all day .
I hit on an idea .
The bus stopped .
Ask her her name .
Tom knows how to make Mary happy .
Who is this boy ?
You &apos;re rich , aren &apos;t you ?
I have a dog .
Both of them are very cute .
Both Tom and John wanted to take Mary to the dance .
It isn &apos;t difficult to speak French .
Come on , you can do it .
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible .
I can &apos;t understand you .
That &apos;s what I told her .
Boston is where I want to be .
She told me a lot about you .
Both his father and mother are dead .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
Where &apos;s Tom today ?
Tom is better at speaking French than the rest of us .
Why did you call ?
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
Tom and I had a lot of fun together .
Tom stopped crying .
Please stop playing with your hat .
You are safe here .
Tom went to buy another pair of shoes .
This book is worth reading twice .
Tom thinks he knows where Mary lives .
We need more food .
I &apos;m not asking for money .
I &apos;ll ask him how the accident happened .
He doesn &apos;t always come late .
I invited Tom to the party .
I feel like eating out tonight .
Don &apos;t you think I know my own brother ?
He had to leave the village .
I only need one thing .
Could you open the window ?
Why don &apos;t people like me ?
He won &apos;t leave me alone .
Why should I learn French ?
We must hurry or else the shop will be closed .
Tom has made a mistake .
Everyone &apos;s busy .
I am convinced that he is innocent .
They don &apos;t make you happy .
That should make you happy .
Tom is doing his homework .
Are you surprised that I came ?
I really don &apos;t feel like talking to Tom right now .
I think Tom understood that .
Why shouldn &apos;t Tom leave ?
She &apos;s busy .
You never told me you had a brother .
It doesn &apos;t matter much .
We all felt sorry for Tom .
Why are you in such a bad mood today ?
She was there in the morning .
I gave it to the little boy .
Where can I get some help ?
That &apos;s just impossible .
We will never do it again .
You &apos;ve really done a fine job .
This is a newspaper .
Are you free now ?
I don &apos;t want to see him at all .
Tom has done a lot for Mary .
I have nothing to do with this accident .
This is not exactly healthy .
I asked him his name .
Do you come here every night ?
I remember Tom well .
Just tell me what I need to tell Tom .
You &apos;ve got until 2 : 30 tomorrow to get this done .
I must use this bike .
I want to travel with you .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it right now .
That book is small .
She gave up smoking .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston .
Tom said to meet him at the little restaurant across from the post office .
You didn &apos;t drink that water , did you ?
Tom meant it as a joke , but nobody laughed .
I wish you had told me about the accident .
Our teacher likes his new car .
&quot; Tom is thirty years old . &quot; &quot; He &apos;s not really that old , is he ? &quot;
That was such good a book that I read it three times .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done for us .
Tom is very dangerous .
I know exactly where Tom is .
They are in favor of your plan .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston last week .
I can &apos;t see him either .
Tom didn &apos;t buy bread .
I &apos;ve only just started studying French .
Don &apos;t give Tom what he wants .
Tom will probably be able to answer your question .
Why do I have to go ?
The sky &apos;s clear today .
I did some work after breakfast and went out .
I &apos;ve got long hair .
Tom believes that Mary is innocent .
I like to walk .
Tom and Mary had a lot of fun .
He looks young for his age .
You won &apos;t remember a thing .
I hope you two are hungry .
All sugar is sweet .
I got Tom to help .
My mother is busy in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t remember who gave this to me .
Tom has been studying French for three years .
Tom says he isn &apos;t giving up .
Take any books that you want to read .
Didn &apos;t you know that ?
Tom is short , but not as short as Mary .
Tom is going to do fine .
This is her house .
Can I have your phone number ?
He fell ill because he ate too much .
Does Tom have a key to Mary &apos;s apartment ?
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom .
Tom just left .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s horse .
I don &apos;t even know if Tom is still alive .
All three of us were at Tom &apos;s party .
Whose book is it ?
I don &apos;t like both of them .
Our money ran out .
He would give an arm and a leg for that .
He doesn &apos;t know any better .
My sister saw it with her own eyes .
I thought Tom was sick .
I &apos;ll go next month .
How many cats does Tom have ?
Tom was rich .
I can &apos;t bear this pain .
Tom lives near Mary .
I &apos;m not ready for it yet .
It &apos;s going fine .
Did you figure this out on your own ?
What happens next ?
Tom and Mary usually speak French together .
I live with my parents .
I don &apos;t like to talk about my problems .
Are you sure this is the right train ?
Tom knows what to do .
Are you angry at him ?
What a beautiful place !
Why don &apos;t you come to Boston ?
They were fine .
What are you thinking ?
I believe that &apos;s correct .
Are you married ?
Thank you for calling .
A person cannot understand another person completely .
What does Tom want from me ?
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all swim .
You can hear everything .
I need a vacation !
What else did you see ?
Why don &apos;t we take a taxi ?
Tom &apos;s first wife was from Boston .
Is Tom stupid ?
We &apos;re working on it .
I &apos;m here to see Tom .
Could you please do that for me ?
Tom and Mary plan to get married soon .
Who is standing there ?
Tom knew I &apos;d be there .
They look healthy .
What am I going to say to Tom ?
He is playing over there .
If this ever happens again , I &apos;ll probably get fired .
I should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see it .
Look who &apos;s there .
You shouldn &apos;t give up hope .
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll lose the game .
Tom was in trouble .
I think we can do that .
I didn &apos;t ask you to help me .
You did it again .
Tom often goes shopping alone .
That &apos;s his horse .
He cannot stop it .
We must find it .
Tom is still very young .
We will keep the room warm .
Tom drinks beer .
I didn &apos;t get home until 2 : 30 .
I needed the money .
Tom says that he believes everything I say .
I didn &apos;t see who was driving .
He married his daughter to a lawyer .
He put the book on the table .
He seldom , if ever , comes .
I just wanted to get it over with .
Everything happens for a reason .
I can &apos;t work for you .
I didn &apos;t get fired .
His girlfriend did it for him .
You should know that &apos;s impossible .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the last three days .
Tom is at home now .
Tom tried not to cry .
They &apos;re small .
Tom looked into Mary &apos;s eyes .
I want to know what you see right now .
Why aren &apos;t you laughing ?
Come out and play .
I don &apos;t like that sentence .
You sure seem happy tonight .
I want you , Tom .
Tom and I &apos;ve decided to go to Boston together next weekend .
It makes no difference whether you go today or tomorrow .
I thought Tom was your brother .
He was loved by everyone that knew him .
Tom comes to Boston every week to see Mary .
I believe I can help you find Tom .
I don &apos;t want to know .
Tom and Mary are still together .
I have to eat dinner with my boss tonight .
I &apos;d like to give you a piece of advice .
She had to use her dictionary many times .
Did Tom really break up with Mary ?
Tom talks as if he were a teacher .
We love coming here .
We waited but he failed to arrive .
I won &apos;t forget it .
Is Tom interested ?
I know Tom isn &apos;t your boyfriend .
I didn &apos;t feel cold .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
I don &apos;t have as much money as you do .
It was just as I thought .
Tom noticed that someone was standing behind Mary .
I think we &apos;re too young .
Everything is working .
This is difficult .
Tom wanted to give Mary a chance to explain why she hadn &apos;t yet done the work .
I found these .
Tom might cry .
What &apos;s for dinner ?
I know Tom is in there .
What are you eating ?
Mary likes you .
I &apos;m not your boyfriend .
I &apos;m still not happy about it .
How did you come by that much money ?
I won &apos;t lose !
You &apos;re doing it right .
Tom never saw his father again .
What good are they ?
I want to spend the whole day with you .
This is new .
Tom and Mary must be very hungry .
I want to come .
It &apos;s very clean .
She is not young .
Tom plans to be there .
Tom and I have both been very busy .
There &apos;s no sugar .
Tom very rarely speaks French .
Your husband is a very lucky man .
Can I speak with Tom ?
I wish I had this problem .
Do you like it then ?
Is this a new car ?
She got home at seven .
We may not be able to afford it .
Let &apos;s have a go at it .
There was nothing on the radio about the accident .
Does it matter to you what time we arrive ?
I &apos;m fat .
Has anyone found Tom yet ?
Tom was there before anyone else .
Why do you think Tom isn &apos;t here ?
I think Tom should do it .
I have to show you something .
He doesn &apos;t eat this , does he ?
He plays golf every weekend .
May I ask you some more questions ?
I am 30 years old now .
She did it on purpose .
It is certain that he will come here .
Tom didn &apos;t give up .
What is it you want ?
We must make a new start .
We &apos;re back home .
I just need to talk to you .
There were too many people at the concert .
We can do a lot better .
I do want to go with you .
The tall man looked at Tom and smiled .
Tom knows how to tell jokes .
Tom asked me to give you this .
I believe that Tom can do that .
Tom said that he thought Mary understood .
Tom wanted to get married to Mary .
Don &apos;t take it seriously .
Tom &apos;s in love with Mary &apos;s best friend .
Was that really worth it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom left the house after breakfast .
What has that to do with me ?
I &apos;m a friend of Tom and Mary &apos;s .
He can swim very fast .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to buy anything for Mary &apos;s birthday .
I knew everyone there .
Tom thinks he can save the world .
She needs to sleep more .
We hardly realize how important it is .
She is too young to know the truth .
That keeps happening to me .
Tom was in Boston three months ago .
Tom is fat .
What is it that you want to know ?
Tom loves Australia .
We &apos;re doing what we have to do .
Tom stayed up late last night .
I would like to give him a present for his birthday .
We have no idea how it happened .
I didn &apos;t kiss him . He kissed me .
I want to help .
I know that he went to London .
Do you intend to help Tom ?
He loves singing .
I still need to buy some bread .
This is going to be good .
We don &apos;t have enough food .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here .
Tom will find somebody .
Please don &apos;t ask me about this again .
I always make this mistake .
Tom ought to have told Mary the truth .
Tom hasn &apos;t played the piano in years .
I have seen it a lot .
I saw my grandfather last week .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy about it .
Her son called from New York .
Tom thinks Mary is beautiful .
What do you want to do about Tom ?
This pizza is cold .
You should &apos;ve heard Tom sing . He was really good .
Tom says he hasn &apos;t eaten in three days .
I &apos;ll be with Tom on Monday .
Why were you eating by yourself ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t leave me alone .
It was simple .
I &apos;ve studied French .
Tom &apos;s talking to himself .
You &apos;re going to have so much fun .
I have a headache .
I can speak a little English .
That &apos;s enough for today . I &apos;m tired .
This piece is impossible to play .
Is there anything that I can do to help you ?
I &apos;m just happy to see you .
She advised him to drink more milk , but he didn &apos;t think this was good advice .
I &apos;m glad we saw Tom .
I hate you all .
Don &apos;t you want to play with Tom ?
I like the sun .
My daughter &apos;s your age .
Tom always looked busy .
You can &apos;t dance , can you ?
Tom wanted to wear his new shoes .
Tom said that he never said that .
Please open the bottle .
Tom can &apos;t read .
I wonder if he is married .
He lost his job .
You don &apos;t have to tell me .
Tom sold it to me .
Do you think you can do better ?
Tom is on the team .
The dog must be hungry .
You can wear anything you want .
She had nothing to do with the case .
One shouldn &apos;t worry about what people are going to say .
I don &apos;t care what anyone says .
When could you do that ?
Tom told me that he spoke French .
Do you know where Tom is ?
Don &apos;t let him answer the phone .
How long does Tom have ?
Are you new , too ?
They trust each other .
How good are you ?
Could I get some tea ?
That is quite possible .
How was your day ?
That tie is too expensive .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be easy to find a place .
Is it broken ?
I don &apos;t want to know about it .
I saw your light was on and knew you were still awake .
Mary is the only woman that I &apos;ve ever been in love with .
Tom and I hardly ever see each other anymore .
Tom isn &apos;t eating .
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom &apos;s face .
What am I going to do with you ?
Tom is going to love you .
I thought that was my job .
I know that Tom did it on purpose .
I &apos;m a student .
Tom closed the store .
Tom looks sad .
I have no money on me .
We &apos;re going to be fine .
The meeting is about to start .
It &apos;s not my fault .
Do you want to play with Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like to talk about his work .
I found out where Tom lives .
It &apos;s our car .
He made a mistake on purpose .
I found the key that I was looking for .
I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ve met Tom .
I can &apos;t make that decision without talking to Tom first .
Tom looked like a doctor .
My head still hurts .
We &apos;re not going to do that again .
Tom sat with Mary on a bench .
I was a teacher .
Tom isn &apos;t safe .
The only person Tom knows here is me .
I &apos;m good at that .
That &apos;s not how .
I think you know why I &apos;m here .
How many boys are there in your class ?
I heard you talking to Tom .
It was well worth the trouble .
I don &apos;t know what this is about .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want some of this ?
I thought Tom was kind of cute .
She &apos;s made up her mind to quit the company .
Tom forgot his glasses .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
You have to stay awake .
I worked there for three months .
I &apos;m learning how to drive .
That lake looks like the sea .
Why don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ?
Tom is never going to ever forget Mary .
There are only two days left .
She is far from honest .
We &apos;re here to help them .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be close to anyone before .
Can you do that ?
That car is quite new .
It &apos;s not like it used to be .
The meat has gone bad .
How is the weather ?
That didn &apos;t really happen .
We &apos;re ready when you are .
He was never to see his wife and family again .
I should &apos;ve done what Tom asked .
He gave me this book .
I read a book .
Are you a student here ?
Where were you when I needed your help ?
Tom has died .
Tom had trouble getting his suitcase opened .
I think Tom will like that .
Are you home , too ?
I haven &apos;t read today &apos;s newspaper yet .
Tom isn &apos;t strong .
Would you have done that the same way Tom did ?
I wish you &apos;d stop calling me Tom .
Why did you listen to them ?
Mary asked me if I loved her .
I think you &apos;re completely right .
I think we need each other .
Maybe we just weren &apos;t meant to be together .
Do you think we will get there on time ?
Can we go somewhere and talk ?
What languages do you speak ?
Do you know how to get to our place ?
They &apos;re no good .
Why don &apos;t we have enough food for everyone ? I thought you went shopping this afternoon .
My cat died yesterday .
Tom has tried to kill himself again .
Tom is a few years older than me .
Tom took his time .
We can meet next week if you want .
I don &apos;t even know where Tom lives .
You may talk as much as you like .
My children can &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;ll go with you .
I want you home in time for dinner .
What if Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to do that ?
I &apos;d never marry someone like that .
This doesn &apos;t happen very often .
I know I &apos;m right .
Tom only knows how to speak French .
You &apos;re supposed to be home with your parents .
You can &apos;t expect more than that .
Do you have this in another color ?
I &apos;ll see you on Monday .
That &apos;s not for Tom .
Will you tell me the truth ?
Which one do you like better ?
Get me some , too .
It &apos;s not too late to do that .
Is this your wine ?
I spoke French to Tom .
If it were not for air , we could not live on the earth .
We were very happy .
Where can I wash my hands before I eat ?
Tom told Mary that John doesn &apos;t like to play tennis .
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn &apos;t ready yet .
Tom might have stolen Mary &apos;s camera .
We &apos;d like to have a word with Tom .
Your tie looks good .
It is really nice of you .
Tom told us a long story .
Do you think I care ?
I have known him for two years .
Try it once more .
Tom bought a newspaper .
You must not do it now .
I &apos;m going to spend the weekend in Boston .
That &apos;s a beautiful piece of meat .
That is no business of yours .
The soup is too hot .
Tom asked me how long I &apos;d lived in Australia .
We can &apos;t even be sure Tom is in Boston .
Tom taught himself French .
I &apos;ve read both books .
You know what , Tom , you &apos;re right .
Tom probably won .
He &apos;s not my father .
He gave each of them a pencil .
Tom is helping me .
I came here to give you a gift .
The telephone doesn &apos;t work .
Tom died three hours after Mary died .
Tom didn &apos;t remember .
It &apos;s very good .
I plan to stay in the city .
If I knew it , I would tell you .
Let me go and buy some bread .
Tom can get them .
Are you sick ?
My mom made it for me .
Tom isn &apos;t famous .
Tom loved his kids more than anything .
You can come .
Is it true that you bought a house in London ?
I thought that Tom had done that for us .
We had a very long talk .
She has a house by the sea .
Did you enjoy the game ?
Tom and Mary walk to school together almost every morning .
Tom is behind you .
Please wait for thirty minutes .
I &apos;m in bed .
I want to try .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re home .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too good .
She kept me waiting for over an hour .
They &apos;re bad .
No one &apos;s going to do that .
Is your husband also from Australia ?
Tom has already left .
If I were rich , I would go abroad .
Tom is at home today .
I go where I want to go .
Let Tom sing .
It &apos;s very , very hot here .
I love you a lot .
Tom wants something , but I &apos;m not sure what .
Tom never told me that you were so beautiful .
He &apos;s your friend .
Could you explain it to me ?
Tom knows I like Mary .
I met her at the station by accident .
That &apos;s all I have .
Can I have another beer , please ?
Tom need not have worried .
How did you learn that Tom was living in Boston ?
He did not read the book .
We &apos;ll take my car .
If you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t need to .
I &apos;m not sure when he &apos;ll come .
I wanted to thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
Tom is reading a novel .
What kind of music do you want us to play ?
Tom is all by himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here in Boston .
That doesn &apos;t belong in here .
Tom bought some flowers for Mary .
What &apos;s become of your dog ?
No one helped me .
Tell me what to do here .
I wonder if Tom likes me .
I &apos;m dying to see you .
Maybe he will be a good teacher .
I know what Tom likes to drink .
I don &apos;t want to die now .
People make mistakes .
It was a dream .
I &apos;ve got a knife .
I know what I &apos;m going to do .
I can play soccer .
This is a great day .
I don &apos;t know any French .
I stayed up late last night reading a novel .
I wouldn &apos;t ask Tom to do anything that he doesn &apos;t really want to do .
You are completely wrong .
I &apos;d like to read it .
I went out to find food .
Is that where Tom is ?
It &apos;s our only chance .
I like playing tennis .
I &apos;m going back .
The police didn &apos;t believe Tom &apos;s story .
I wasn &apos;t alone .
Tom will probably be here in the morning .
Why do they do it ?
Tom is playing in his room .
I am a student , but he isn &apos;t .
He is almost always home .
Try not to be late tomorrow .
Who wants another piece of cake ?
Tom can &apos;t tell jokes .
Would you do me a favor , Tom ?
We didn &apos;t kill anyone .
I don &apos;t know why they did that .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s in this box .
Have you ever written a letter to Tom ?
Tom is nice to me .
Tom locked the apartment .
I have some good news and some bad news .
I just want to go to sleep .
I should &apos;ve done this months ago .
I see your house .
Have you asked the others ?
Please go to school .
That &apos;s just a start .
Tom broke his promise and didn &apos;t help Mary .
I watch television .
What &apos;s going on down there ?
I want to be famous .
He told me everything .
He &apos;s done his homework .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will come .
Why do I even bother ?
&quot; Who is it ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s your mother . &quot;
Isn &apos;t that a boy &apos;s name ?
I think you &apos;d know the reason for that better than I do .
Tom doesn &apos;t like kids .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think Mary really needed to do that .
You &apos;ll do exactly as I say .
Tom was quiet all day .
Tom had work to do .
I mean what I &apos;m saying .
Tom fell into a deep sleep .
This is the best restaurant that I know .
You &apos;re good at this , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom needed time .
The fruit went bad .
Tom saw Mary today .
Tom may be on the next train .
I don &apos;t know them .
It is time you told her the truth .
Excuse me . Where are the eggs ?
I think Tom is OK .
I think you &apos;d better leave .
Tom often plays tennis after school .
It was hard to believe .
I think that Tom is tall .
This happens to us all the time .
He had fun with her .
I always speak French with Tom .
May I see my girlfriend now ?
Who &apos;s your girlfriend ?
I need Tom &apos;s money .
We need to talk .
Why do I have to do it ?
Did Tom say why ?
What makes you think that isn &apos;t true ?
He became a policeman .
Why don &apos;t you ever say it ?
Please read the whole story .
One stayed and the other went away .
Do you want Tom to go to Boston ?
I am working on my new book .
She looked as if she hadn &apos;t eaten in days .
Tom made Mary do that .
They are good people .
I will show you the picture .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary , but he had no choice .
I &apos;m not so sure .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as Tom .
Does Tom like his job ?
Tom killed Mary and then killed himself .
No one here knows anything .
I was out for a walk .
I wonder why the police didn &apos;t find the gun .
Do you know what Tom wants ?
Do you know what time it is ?
They want to go home .
This is not important .
What do you want me to do ?
I &apos;m feeling fine now .
He has to study hard .
Is that a promise ?
Has Tom kissed you , too ?
He should come right away !
I &apos;m certain he &apos;s coming .
He must buy a new bicycle for his son .
I know that you still think about me .
Tom doesn &apos;t often wear a suit .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t like it here .
I &apos;m bored . Let &apos;s do something .
Are you happy , Tom ?
I think that you are correct .
I &apos;d like that .
What are you doing today ?
I &apos;m young , but I &apos;m not that young .
It &apos;s a long story .
I don &apos;t think that you really want to know .
I &apos;ve only been there once .
All I want is you .
You &apos;re always welcome here , Tom .
You should arrive at school before nine .
It &apos;s no use .
This is from Tom .
I didn &apos;t know what else to say to Tom .
Tell Tom I won &apos;t be there .
You &apos;ve been here a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
Her dream will one day come true .
Perhaps this is wrong .
We never talked about that again .
Tom tried to save Mary .
Tom says he wants to leave the country .
I don &apos;t recognize any of these men .
You are a teacher .
It &apos;s five o &apos;clock .
Tom was there for me .
We know that your name isn &apos;t Tom .
I hope we &apos;ll see Tom again .
I can &apos;t see any difference .
I don &apos;t have time to read .
Tom had to catch a taxi .
It &apos;s not that simple .
What do they think it said ?
I haven &apos;t found Tom yet .
I know what that &apos;s like .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to his parents .
You &apos;ll never know the truth .
Tom is the only person who knows about this .
I think I &apos;d be a good father .
How do you feel about what she said ?
Tom started reading .
The book is small .
Tom really likes music a lot .
Try and do better next time .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
Are you still happy with your new car ?
You will like Germany .
Tom hardly ever makes mistakes .
Tom will probably be busy tomorrow .
Tom wants to go there again .
We &apos;re here to have fun .
I want to go to America some day .
Can I speak in English ?
How &apos;re they doing that ?
What is it now ?
He has a dog and six cats .
I &apos;m sorry I cannot go with you .
I think he &apos;s too young .
My family &apos;s not rich .
I have a friend who went to school with Tom .
That &apos;s mine .
I don &apos;t want to be late today .
Is it there ?
You think you &apos;re better than me , don &apos;t you ?
I learned how to do that just last month .
Not every bird can sing .
You &apos;re not as old as I thought you were .
I knew that .
Tom is used to sitting all day at his desk .
I know why he did it .
Tom is thinking about what happened .
He stood out because he was wearing a suit .
Is it in there ?
It may seem like a crazy idea , but I think we should go visit Tom and Mary right now .
Where am I ?
I &apos;m waiting for an answer .
I will go to the meeting .
He speaks too fast .
Don &apos;t go to Boston .
I know a very good way to get it done .
It &apos;s a short walk .
He broke my heart .
I like your room .
She went home .
It seemed too good to be true .
Mary really takes after her mother .
We have to save Tom .
I don &apos;t want to see this again .
What do you think of these ?
We came to play .
I &apos;m expecting .
Tom always talks fast .
How bad was Tom hurt ?
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat .
We &apos;ll decide .
What &apos;re you looking at , Tom ?
I &apos;m sorry , but I have no more time .
We don &apos;t have all the time in the world .
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before she left .
We still have time .
I &apos;d like to see it .
I &apos;ve got a lot to do .
Tom isn &apos;t finished doing that .
I usually go home at four .
She takes after her mother .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom never gave up .
I have no idea who you &apos;re talking about .
Your question does not have an answer .
Tom isn &apos;t very happy , is he ?
Tom left Mary last year .
Everything was taken from us .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows French .
He had nothing to do with it .
Go inside .
You may not like this book .
You didn &apos;t tell me that Tom speaks French .
He didn &apos;t say a single word .
Is that all you want to know ?
My father bought this hat for me .
I &apos;m not busy now .
Tom never was very interested .
Tom may not do that .
Do you really think that Tom can help us ?
She is about your age .
He cannot have done it by himself .
I like fish .
I &apos;m doing this for Tom .
I &apos;m sorry , but my mother is out at the moment .
Everybody seems to like it .
Take me to Tom .
No one is too old to learn .
Tom said he was in love with Mary .
She asked him how to get to the station .
Tom loves dogs .
I can &apos;t tell you everything .
We can &apos;t give up now .
I was very worried about her .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married .
I think Tom is honest .
Tom is in Australia already .
That &apos;s no secret .
I am almost scared to talk with you .
Are we sure about that ?
I don &apos;t remember getting paid for the work .
I &apos;ve never heard my mother sing .
We &apos;ve done nothing .
How do you know all these things ?
We must start immediately .
She invited him to her party .
We don &apos;t want to do that .
How many people do you know well ?
I remember seeing her .
I would like to have a cup of coffee .
This computer is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
She came to see us yesterday .
The reason I &apos;m here is because I was asked to come .
I began to cry .
He has a sister and she goes to school , too .
There are a few books in the bag .
She is a most beautiful lady .
Tom seems to be waiting for someone .
He seemed to have been ill .
She is the person I was waiting for .
What do you want me to do with these ?
Tom is my teacher .
What are you doing in Tom &apos;s car ?
I don &apos;t want you anymore .
Did you happen to meet him ?
How do you like your new class ?
He is writing a letter to his parents now .
I can &apos;t forget her .
It was the only way .
Tom can &apos;t speak any French .
I asked Tom if he was nervous .
Tom didn &apos;t do any work .
I should thank Tom .
He was lying on the couch .
They enjoy playing together .
Tom realized Mary was right .
She is proud of her children .
Tom can &apos;t explain what happened .
I can &apos;t quite believe that .
Tom likes to listen to music while he &apos;s studying .
He could still be alive somewhere .
I should &apos;ve let Tom win .
We &apos;ll take a look .
How did Tom do this ?
Do you know what he has done ?
We tried to convince Tom not to do it .
You look tired .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone at the party .
Tom arrived on Monday .
Have you eaten dinner ?
I think you can help us .
He doesn &apos;t know how to play golf .
I changed my mind .
Are you new here ?
She told him a joke .
If that guitar weren &apos;t so expensive , I could buy it .
Tom ate lunch at home .
Both of my brothers did that .
She seems to have been ill .
Tom is very rich , isn &apos;t he ?
He stayed at the hotel for two days .
He ran away as soon as he saw me .
I hate milk .
That was fun .
Tom is sick .
Would you care for some more cake ?
I came for you .
Tom didn &apos;t have time to read the report .
Is this your letter ?
He gave me a ride home .
Tom sat at his desk .
I know Tom wants us to help him .
You can answer it .
You were right to worry .
It doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
We &apos;ve already lost three days .
Tom is nervous , too .
Tom is old enough to be Mary &apos;s grandfather .
How long have I been asleep ?
Tom didn &apos;t even know who Mary was .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses .
How many people came to your party ?
Tom can drive .
Where did you find Tom ?
He is afraid of making mistakes .
I want something else to read .
I &apos;ll go get that .
Why didn &apos;t you let me know ?
I don &apos;t know much about Australia .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
I have a feeling that she &apos;ll come today .
That &apos;s a very beautiful dress .
I want eggs .
It can &apos;t be helped .
What we need is help .
Would you mind if I ask you a few questions ?
I can never thank you enough .
I &apos;m trying to figure out something .
He can play the piano better than I can .
I get by .
It doesn &apos;t look as if it &apos;s going to happen .
Nobody has ever loved him .
I asked him if I could read his book .
I &apos;m going to study French .
It seems that the store is closed today .
Today is my birthday .
We can &apos;t do that either .
You shouldn &apos;t wait any longer .
This isn &apos;t about you , Tom .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ve found you .
You didn &apos;t have to come into the office today .
You can have it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t do that .
Tom is playing outside .
What do you hate ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to do .
You don &apos;t really care , do you ?
Tom worked very hard .
That &apos;s where Tom is .
No one could sleep that night .
I didn &apos;t know you were so tired .
Tom is popular .
Tom quit studying French .
I went swimming in the sea .
Just give it up , Tom .
What kind of girl are you ?
Here &apos;s the list of the people who helped .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as his brother .
She will care for you from now on .
I wonder if Tom is as interested in this as Mary is .
I asked Tom a lot of questions .
I love meeting new people .
I &apos;ve been working .
He will not listen to me .
Tom looks nice .
That &apos;s not what I think .
Thank you for giving me this .
Are you done with your homework yet ?
I read the report you wrote .
Who is he and what &apos;s his name ?
I know that Tom is happy .
We &apos;re not leaving until we see Tom .
Tom changed his name .
Tom promised to sell me his old guitar .
She must be angry .
Tom convinced me .
There are few men who don &apos;t know that .
Nobody &apos;s seen Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way I speak .
Could you give me a ride to the station ?
We &apos;ll take a look at it .
Have you made a decision ?
Tom showed Mary the letter he had just written .
My uncle bought me this book .
How late are you open ?
Do you know where we &apos;re going ?
I slept on the boat .
I &apos;d do anything for Tom .
I have nothing to do with the matter .
Your boyfriend looks cute .
Have you ever spent any time with Tom ?
Tom seems quiet .
Tom is reading it .
I would buy this watch , except it &apos;s too expensive .
When will you call ?
Tom waited for Mary for a long time .
I wish I could help you find a good job .
Your car is fast .
Tom did that for Mary .
I need to read a lot .
He ran .
I just want to ask Tom a few questions .
There &apos;s no water .
It &apos;s too hot for me .
What does this have to do with my future ?
You don &apos;t look too good .
He looks a bit tired .
I &apos;m going to tell you everything .
Tom is not yet able to swim .
I hope Tom is in Boston all next week .
We &apos;ve always done it this way .
Is Tom a good person ?
I think about them often .
The weather here is getting cold and I really do not like that .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at it .
When are you busy ?
Maybe I went a little too far .
What &apos;s your father &apos;s name ?
Would you make room for me ?
Tom is as busy as I am .
They cannot stop him .
I &apos;ll get the book .
He said that I shouldn &apos;t even be coming in today .
I can &apos;t believe you gave Tom that much money .
I &apos;m going to stay home today and read a book .
I will help you if possible .
She wore a beautiful dress .
I think you should pick Tom .
I wish that I could help .
I will help you all I can .
I &apos;ll be at home tomorrow .
What else do you have in your pocket ?
I can &apos;t figure out why she didn &apos;t come .
She didn &apos;t intend to let him kiss her .
Tom is coming to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like John .
The war is over .
I can &apos;t say exactly what the problem is .
What he says is true .
How long are they ?
I think I know what Tom is doing .
They &apos;ve done it before .
She &apos;s found herself a boyfriend .
Tom just needs a little rest .
Tom has been in prison since October .
Tom looked outside .
Just tell me where Tom is .
Did you love Tom ?
I must find it .
I try not to think about it .
I don &apos;t know how to play golf at all .
I don &apos;t go to school by the bus .
Have you ever taught French to anyone ?
I &apos;ll call him .
He seems to have been ill .
Do you feel better ?
Tom immediately began crying again .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary would be there .
What does this do ?
Tom became tired .
Tom heard Mary talking .
Tom said that he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
Tom arrived at the party after Mary did .
That &apos;s very sweet .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is .
I know what love is .
He died five years ago .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m still alive .
Have you eaten the cake yet ?
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom yet .
Mary is kind of pretty .
I know what they said .
That &apos;s my job , not Tom &apos;s .
The weather had been hot .
Where are our friends ?
Nobody &apos;s there .
Why are we laughing ?
Tell me what happened .
Don &apos;t smoke here .
Do we really want to walk to Tom &apos;s house ?
Would you like something to drink ?
He is doing well .
You must do it .
Today &apos;s the big day .
I asked Tom if he was OK .
Tom is a bad person .
His pictures are very famous .
Tom makes me feel safe .
Do you have a pencil ?
Tom never saw Mary .
I can &apos;t wait to meet you all .
Why don &apos;t we talk about this now ?
What else did Tom eat ?
He &apos;ll be glad to see you .
Tom didn &apos;t feel like waiting .
I go to bed at ten almost every day .
Can you tell me why we need to do this ?
My watch may be one or two minutes fast .
We all like him .
It was three hours ago .
I will come to see you next Sunday .
Tom would never do anything like that .
We do not know him .
Tom had to run .
Don &apos;t ever leave me alone with Tom .
You &apos;ll understand it right away .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s mother .
It &apos;s true .
I had been working for two hours when I suddenly felt sick .
How many fish did you catch ?
We &apos;re taking it seriously .
Tom is already here , but Mary hasn &apos;t gotten here yet .
This room is very warm .
Have you ever been abroad ?
I can &apos;t really do anything until Tom gets here .
This has never been tried before .
This table is heavy .
Where did they teach you that ?
That doesn &apos;t matter to me .
The problem was too much for me .
I &apos;m sorry about your mom .
That &apos;s more like it .
They &apos;re too dangerous .
She is very careful , so she seldom makes mistakes .
Everybody makes mistakes .
I learned to play guitar when I was ten years old .
I was invited to Tom &apos;s party .
Tom never asked them what they wanted .
I met him in Tokyo by chance .
The child is learning quickly .
Where do you want to live ?
You &apos;re the one that wanted to see me , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom might have to study French .
The days are getting longer .
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes .
I don &apos;t want to live by your rules .
No one &apos;s going to see us .
We have to hurry .
I &apos;m sorry I didn &apos;t call .
Tom looked around the room .
I went to church with him .
I hope that helped .
You have no idea how important you are to me .
I don &apos;t know what that is .
We have a few questions for you .
Tom should have told Mary the truth .
Tom said Mary is at home .
I know who you &apos;re thinking about .
She &apos;s being nice to me .
Tom runs very fast .
I can &apos;t tell you what I think .
I &apos;ll come tomorrow .
Tom can &apos;t see us .
You may be right about that .
You &apos;re late again .
There is not much hope .
Would you like to be left alone ?
Tom is going to get one .
Tom wondered what Mary was going to do .
I just wanted to see if I could do that .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t here .
This book is too expensive . I can &apos;t afford to buy it .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go swimming with us ?
I wish to see my father .
I &apos;m not sick .
Who could you do that with ?
Tom told me he was glad to see me .
You can stay till tonight .
What do you say ?
It wasn &apos;t Tom who left the water running .
Tom is the only person for the job .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;ll be finished .
She must have forgotten all about the promise .
Tom almost won .
Tom never talks about his job .
Tom has all day to get that done .
I wasn &apos;t listening to the radio .
That &apos;s no way to talk to your teacher .
You &apos;re only three years older than me .
I haven &apos;t heard from him for a long time .
They were pretty upset .
Who is he ?
I don &apos;t live in Boston anymore .
She lives alone in this room .
I &apos;ll see to it .
We enjoyed swimming .
I don &apos;t intend to go to Boston with you .
Who stole the apples ?
The boy bought a dog .
Everybody had a problem with Tom .
I &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
The sun is coming up .
Is this your room ?
Maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
How far along are you ?
Tom has a right to know .
Don &apos;t give up hope .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
The boy standing over there is my son .
I didn &apos;t know Tom knew how to do that .
He threw the ball .
You must take care of the dog .
Look at the train going over the bridge .
Tom said he had a friend in Boston .
I took a taxi to get there in time .
You &apos;ll find our house at the end of the next street .
Do you really want to know the truth ?
I did everything Tom asked me to do .
I thought it was best not to say anything .
What do you think of these shoes ?
This matter is extremely important to us .
You should read many books when you are young .
We &apos;re going to Boston to see Tom .
Does everybody want it ?
Tom loved Mary , who didn &apos;t love him at all .
I can teach you how to read .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember having said that .
What &apos;s in your pocket ?
What do I look like ?
Take this .
Tom likes Mary and Mary likes Tom .
I &apos;m not eating this .
I want to be young again .
She still loved him .
The old man stopped suddenly and looked back .
You are free to do as you please with your money .
Tom goes to Boston every once in a while .
What do you want to say to Tom ?
You should sleep .
You have to stop drinking .
Have you ever been to France ?
We &apos;ll be seeing you , Tom .
I want to live in a big city .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you for hours .
Look what we have here .
He said that he was very happy .
You should meet Tom .
How is your dad ?
As I missed the train , I had to wait for the next one for about an hour .
I want to see my parents .
Be quiet while I am speaking .
What is it you want to do ?
I only speak French with Tom .
I made Tom buy it for me .
Tom didn &apos;t like living in the country .
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be interested .
I don &apos;t know what to do right now .
Call my husband .
My big brother finished his homework very quickly .
Tom ran away with the money .
He came to my office yesterday .
He likes me and I like him too .
These people have lost everything .
I asked Tom to close the door .
Tom is not as fat as I am .
How is this even possible ?
Come on , Tom . It &apos;ll be fun .
Can you stay for a few days ?
I haven &apos;t been able to find out anything about it .
Tom seemed to know everyone .
Where &apos;s the bank ?
Tom can &apos;t hurt you .
You &apos;ve done a very good job .
I will not do it again .
Do you know how to fix this ?
I wrote her a letter every day .
If you don &apos;t do that , I won &apos;t either .
I heard it .
Everything &apos;s fine the way it is .
I asked you not to play with that .
I have a good dictionary .
She happened to have the day off .
He got the ball .
Where is the newspaper ?
Who was it that gave you that ?
Please think about the problem .
I &apos;m one of you .
Your bag is on my desk .
Does it hurt ?
I have to go to work .
I know you &apos;re not scared .
Tom really doesn &apos;t need the money .
I might be drunk , but I &apos;m not crazy .
Who found them ?
There is a dictionary on the desk .
Could someone please help me ?
He keeps a cat .
I would rather have a cat than a dog .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t wait for us .
Tom believed the story that Mary told him .
This is really delicious .
Stop listening to Tom .
Tom did do that .
I &apos;m too busy to help him .
Tom looks like he &apos;s rich .
I just haven &apos;t had the chance .
I need water .
Today I just feel like staying at home and doing nothing .
I will never tell it to anybody .
There &apos;s something wrong .
I &apos;m not sure what Tom is trying to say .
Mary and Alice aren &apos;t sisters .
I would like to know her name .
Tom doesn &apos;t make enough money to support his family .
The answer is right .
Tom got here thirty minutes early .
This is the only thing I care about .
I have a pain here .
It took him three years to write the novel .
Are they your friends ?
You don &apos;t want to do that , do you ?
The old man lives alone .
That was really bad .
I see Tom and Mary .
Where did you buy that book ?
The bike &apos;s mine .
Give me your opinion , please .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be happy .
Tom is the one .
You &apos;re not going to walk , are you ?
There &apos;s a lot of money involved .
Let us know whether you can come .
Where do we know each other from ?
I haven &apos;t sold one of those in weeks .
You have to answer this question .
You &apos;ll have to look out for Tom .
Tom stood alone .
They were completely surprised .
It makes no difference whether you go or not .
I say this from my own experience .
How do we get out of this situation ?
We &apos;re not ready to order yet .
It was a new experience for everyone .
Can I do it again ?
Tom and Mary are getting married next month .
I see the boy .
I eat here .
I hope Tom won &apos;t be too disappointed .
Do you think you could make a little less noise ?
The man hit me on the head .
Tom said he thought that Mary was in Boston .
Tom knows what Mary did three days ago .
He &apos;s married and has three children .
Where are the boys ?
I &apos;m not going to go .
Tom opened his eyes .
He stood behind the chair .
Tom says he &apos;s not going .
I &apos;m not a child .
Nothing ever happens in this old village .
We have rules .
What &apos;s your sister &apos;s name ?
Have you and Tom ever kissed each other ?
I arrived on Monday .
Tom wants me to go with him .
I play the piano .
Here it is .
He went there to learn English .
Why don &apos;t you want to wear a tie ?
She invited her friends to dinner .
You can do this , can &apos;t you ?
We know about Tom .
We are to meet at the station at nine .
What about you ?
I &apos;m nothing without you .
He will come soon .
How are we feeling today ?
Tom will answer all of your questions .
Tom pretended that he knew nothing about it .
Tom said Mary was his daughter .
Please ask someone else .
Do you know who wrote this book ?
Why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
Since you have nothing to do with this matter , you don &apos;t have to worry .
I &apos;m drinking a beer right now .
I know what Tom saw .
It &apos;s all over now .
I do not think that she is at home .
I saw Tom with Mary .
I had to get something out of the car .
You look just like him .
You might be correct .
Tom ran for his life .
When was the last time that you did something for the first time ?
Tom often appears on TV .
I want to see how Tom lives .
Where &apos;s my hat ?
Tom told me that he would help us .
Tom has a car .
Tom can play tennis better than Mary .
We have to get it done now .
Mary isn &apos;t just my sister . She &apos;s my best friend , too .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all can speak French .
This book looks interesting .
Tom was born in Boston .
We need to go visit Tom in the hospital .
They &apos;re broken .
Tom always eats before going to work .
I was looking at old pictures .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
Tom was tired and in a bad mood .
The glass is empty .
I agreed with her .
Have you seen the news ?
Everything he says is true .
Tom was not able to quit smoking .
I don &apos;t know why Tom needs that much money .
Tom didn &apos;t know how to translate the word &quot; computer &quot; because the people he was talking to had never seen one .
Tom made me carry his suitcase .
He will come home in a few days .
Tom will help us .
Maybe I should have a talk with Tom .
I feel exactly the same way I did three years ago .
Tom is still alive .
Tom knows what he wants to see .
Tom speaks French as well as Mary .
He is famous as a doctor .
I &apos;m not from Australia .
Do you want to know why I &apos;m here ?
Tom is happy .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom wants to tell you about Mary .
You should think about your future .
I know why you want it .
Tom made Mary swim .
This bus will take you to the airport .
It &apos;s good to see you , too .
I &apos;d love to go out with you .
That was only a year ago .
I like it , too .
What does Tom do every day ?
Would you like to go to a movie ?
Where were you an hour ago ?
I think my French isn &apos;t very good .
Don &apos;t forget that it &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday tomorrow .
I didn &apos;t say I was in love with Tom .
I wonder if that &apos;s even possible .
I just want to talk .
Tom wants an apple .
I bought the book yesterday .
I &apos;ve got wine .
Tom &apos;s been looking for you .
I should have listened to Tom .
I thought you didn &apos;t want to go .
There &apos;s someone else I want to see .
I should be in charge .
She tried her best to help him .
Tom finally believes us .
I &apos;ve never said this before to anyone .
Tom won &apos;t go away if you don &apos;t want him to .
He is nothing but a child .
I &apos;ve always wanted to travel through Europe .
Tom could do it .
Tom and Mary are both sitting over there .
Have you ever been in love ?
He does not care for ice cream .
You might be right .
She wasn &apos;t able to explain this situation to me .
Tom is proud of his son .
Have they arrived yet ?
We see each other every day .
Did you phone Tom ?
Tom might &apos;ve died .
It was a very big room .
I &apos;m sick .
What difference does it make if people are looking at us ?
No one was there .
I will speak to you tomorrow .
Is something wrong with your eyes ?
You &apos;d probably really like it .
You can &apos;t have the job .
I can &apos;t answer your question .
I have a few books .
He is not young .
I wasn &apos;t at home then .
Do you have the book ?
I can understand French better than I can speak it .
What is in the desk ?
Tom hasn &apos;t bought bread yet .
Are you in trouble ?
There must be another way we can help Tom .
I &apos;ve never heard Tom speak French .
You don &apos;t need to go there .
Tom and Mary are crazy .
That &apos;s how it should be .
What &apos;ll Tom show Mary ?
We sure had fun , didn &apos;t we ?
No one has heard Tom say Mary &apos;s name .
I &apos;ve got no idea how it works .
Tom has no right to do this .
Take what you like .
You already knew that , didn &apos;t you ?
Nobody knew .
Don &apos;t forget to buy some eggs .
That has nothing to do with him .
Mary is going to have a baby next month .
Tom seemed to know exactly what he was doing .
Why do you hate me ?
You shouldn &apos;t trust that man .
Tom took my money .
I had him wash the car .
I agree with everything Tom said .
He broke his promise , which was a big mistake .
These shoes are too expensive .
I don &apos;t need any help .
My father drives very well .
I don &apos;t like it here .
I &apos;m glad to see that you &apos;re happy .
What happens tomorrow ?
She was kind enough to show me around the town .
Let Tom carry it .
He is American .
We used to be best friends .
You &apos;re the only one who can help us .
Stay away from my computer .
You &apos;d better tell me what happened .
Tom is very kind .
Let &apos;s not talk about that right now .
You probably don &apos;t have as much time as I do .
&quot; Are you hungry ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always hungry . &quot;
She made him happy .
Tom has some good news to tell you .
I didn &apos;t promise Tom anything .
Tom has been away for three days .
I need them .
I hope it does not rain tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand why .
Do you think Tom really did this without any help ?
Do it yourself .
He doesn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t study hard enough .
Tom drove Mary to the hospital .
Where was Tom last weekend ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom here ?
Tom is never coming back .
We &apos;ve talked about it .
My sister is younger than me .
They cannot stop me .
Tom &apos;s busy .
It &apos;s all I need .
Tom died just as he was trying to say something to Mary .
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him .
I think about him all the time .
I &apos;m not even sure I want to see that movie .
Now it &apos;s your turn .
Tom isn &apos;t innocent .
He cannot stop me .
Tom is here for you .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a brother .
They don &apos;t trust each other .
I should &apos;ve stayed .
You don &apos;t have to answer these questions .
Tom must be over thirty .
The soup was too hot .
Would you like a glass of wine ?
Tom will do that again tomorrow .
He asked us not to make any noise .
I don &apos;t have to work on Monday .
Tom looks tired .
May I go now ?
Tom is like one of the family .
You have to spend more time with your son .
Tom likes to listen to music .
This is all my fault .
She is young .
That sometimes happens .
The boy has an apple in his pocket .
To live without air is impossible .
Tom had to go there alone .
My mother has made me what I am today .
We &apos;ve been studying French for three years .
Tom is very tall .
I thought it was a joke .
I don &apos;t want to lose Tom .
It was Sunday yesterday .
Please don &apos;t tell me to stop drinking .
I &apos;ve never been to that town .
Is Tom at home now ?
Tom took Mary and her daughter home .
Tom is happy with it .
I haven &apos;t tried .
What should I have done ?
How &apos;s your wife ?
Maybe it &apos;s not too late .
He told me a long story .
What do you know about that ?
He never saw his mother again .
&quot; Please give me some water . &quot; &quot; All right . &quot;
Do you want to know or not ?
I &apos;m not doing this with you again .
You don &apos;t need to worry about Tom anymore .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve always said .
Could somebody please open the door ?
Tom locked himself out of his house .
Tom wants to be a doctor .
Would you like another glass of wine ?
Will you buy something ?
I love old books .
Mary looks hot .
Tom came close to losing an eye .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party yesterday .
Do you want me to call the police ?
My mother died when I was a child .
Are you saying that you don &apos;t have enough money ?
I think we should have Tom do that for us .
We &apos;ll get this one .
What else can I do for you ?
Did Tom tell you that ?
Tom is busy .
No one could tell where she was .
Tom hates running .
I like rice .
I heard every word .
I &apos;ve never loved anybody as much as I love you .
He is proud of never having been late for school .
This is my family .
I really like him .
Tom and I were very busy last week .
I don &apos;t know who Tom is planning to see in Boston .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s father .
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
I &apos;d just like to ask Tom one question .
I &apos;m sure Tom is fine .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary knows why John doesn &apos;t like her .
Tom will like this .
Tom has been married before .
I don &apos;t think they would &apos;ve done anything .
Do you know the girl standing by the window ?
I &apos;ll join you later .
Tom was in the garden .
It &apos;s definitely a bad idea .
Where are you going on Monday ?
Why do I have to do that ?
She came with good news .
You &apos;re very good at this .
I don &apos;t know anything about the future .
&quot; What did you say ? &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say anything . &quot;
This is not safe .
He &apos;s coming .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is able to do that or not .
This is all wrong .
I think Tom and Mary are in love .
Tom wants to see his son .
My family is small .
Tom doesn &apos;t read books .
Please listen to me when I &apos;m speaking to you .
The break is over .
I didn &apos;t see it coming .
How did you know that Tom had never been to Boston ?
Tom was shy .
Tom wanted to go with Mary .
They &apos;ve fired him .
Why don &apos;t you go ?
I prefer coffee to tea .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink .
Tom barely ate .
Tom has trouble standing on one leg .
Tom told Mary that he was busy .
I don &apos;t like to study languages .
Don &apos;t leave me alone .
Tom didn &apos;t start to study French until he was thirty .
I wonder why you would say that .
I &apos;m certain that he &apos;ll come .
I &apos;ll put some salt in the soup .
Was Tom happy ?
Tom asked Mary to help him with his homework .
How will you stop them ?
Do you know what they want ?
Why won &apos;t anybody help me ?
Tom let us all down .
I gave him all the money I had .
Tom &apos;s mother &apos;s dead .
Do this before you do anything else .
I may have told you such a thing , but I don &apos;t remember it at all .
Tom is sound asleep on the sofa .
There was more than enough food .
Tom is doing very well .
I got a letter from her .
The train was about to leave the station .
I hope he will come .
Let &apos;s hit the town tonight and have some fun .
Tom is driving without a license .
I am sure of his coming to the party .
We need to speak to Tom again .
Take us there .
I &apos;m proud of you .
Tom can &apos;t come to the phone right now .
Our TV is out of order .
Tom wasn &apos;t with Mary .
Many people do this .
I know that Mary is more beautiful than I am .
Tom said very little .
I knew you &apos;d be happy here .
I &apos;ve got a lot of friends .
What do you think of these people ?
She came back an hour later .
Tom is lying in bed .
I &apos;m much older than you think I am .
Did I say you could talk ?
He got up early this morning .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to learn French .
Did you do something you shouldn &apos;t have ?
I love going to Boston .
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
Let me know if you need my help .
I &apos;ll drive you there .
Tom seemed lucky .
Don &apos;t leave me behind !
I don &apos;t like to go out when it &apos;s dark .
You look just like your father .
Tom sounds exactly like his father .
I may be a bit crazy .
I can lend you some money if you need some .
I don &apos;t feel well today .
I saw it first .
It &apos;s likely Tom knows Mary &apos;s phone number .
That &apos;s a good idea .
Tom almost never gets sick .
I thought that he was angry .
What would I do without you ?
She will have a baby next month .
The soup is hot .
Are you saying you don &apos;t want to be a teacher anymore ?
Tom couldn &apos;t make it to Mary &apos;s party .
What would Tom do without me ?
Tell Tom yourself .
I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;ll help .
There &apos;s a lot of work to do .
Who else is there with you ?
It works pretty well here .
It is too dark to play outside .
You better buy that book .
Tom and Mary got married very young .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Tom and Mary got married three days ago .
Tom is the only friend I have here in Boston .
I saw Tom &apos;s father .
Tom really needs to tell Mary the truth .
We know very little about it .
Tom wrote a song about Mary .
You don &apos;t have to do that today .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak French .
Tom needs a friend .
He &apos;s no doctor .
Tom is able to come to our party tomorrow .
When do you use it ?
What can you tell me about this ?
Tom probably won &apos;t buy such a big car .
The problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
I &apos;d ask Tom to do that .
He made the right choice .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t see much of each other anymore .
You should have stayed in the car .
I &apos;m glad to hear of your success .
Tom shouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
Where will we meet ?
Europe is not a country .
Where &apos;s the beach ?
Both of my parents don &apos;t know how to swim .
You knew I knew .
Tom wanted to start a new life .
Give it to me !
That will do .
I saw tears in his eyes .
Tom sent you something .
That book is a new book .
What do you think of your own face ?
I hate Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in the city .
Could you lend me a hand ?
My mother doesn &apos;t speak English very well .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
Could you give me your name ?
I think you look like Tom .
Tom is very happy in Boston .
I &apos;m waiting for the right woman .
I have friends .
We played baseball yesterday .
I &apos;m not going to let Tom sing .
People listen to Tom .
This picture was taken by him .
I told him about our school .
Is there anything I should know ?
How do you think we can help Tom ?
I now live in Australia .
I remember asking an old man the way .
Tom is Mary &apos;s type .
I had the same problem as you .
They seem very busy .
What time is it ?
I am in favor of your proposal .
He doesn &apos;t have to know .
Who does she think that she is ?
Can we do that ?
It &apos;s not always like that .
She &apos;ll be getting married next year .
The children rarely go outside .
I don &apos;t want to believe you .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go .
I &apos;ve never heard such a thing .
I don &apos;t know . What do you think ?
You can &apos;t go yet .
Why does that interest you ?
Tom lives in Australia .
Tom needs to get ready for school .
I always wanted to have a dog .
My taxi should be here soon .
&quot; How many girls do you have ? &quot; &quot; I only have one . &quot;
We all believe in something .
She is free from care .
I &apos;m going out in an hour .
Tom finally left .
Tom is always kind to everyone .
Are you sure you didn &apos;t do anything ?
If anyone can do that , it &apos;s Tom .
I know he is busy .
Tom is going to do that for Mary .
They may be in danger .
Tom can &apos;t sing as well as Mary .
Tom started working for Mary last year .
We &apos;ll be there at half past two .
I just want to be his friend .
I was afraid of what people would think .
I only saw one person on the beach .
My mother can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
Tom and I are just students .
I must have a cup of coffee in the morning .
Is your father in the garden ?
I hate to see you like this .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I &apos;ll do it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about this .
It certainly looks like rain .
Don &apos;t worry about us .
I know what &apos;s wrong .
How come you never told me you were from Boston ?
If I had a son , I wouldn &apos;t name him Tom .
I thought Tom was in danger .
The fire went out .
Tom took his seat .
Tom &apos;ll help .
I want to tell her the truth .
Tom disappointed me .
Are you sure that Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
I &apos;ll get Tom .
Tom can speak French better than Mary .
We must help him immediately .
Tom has something in his hand .
Tom &apos;s sister &apos;s name is Mary .
They invited me to dinner .
Tom isn &apos;t coming till tomorrow .
You &apos;re too stupid to live .
I &apos;ll stop by later .
Tom tried really hard to do that .
I think my parents know .
Tom helped me a lot with that .
Tom couldn &apos;t move .
How are you going to Boston ?
Mary is Tom &apos;s mother .
It would be sad if that were true .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to study in Boston .
Tom seemed to remember me .
I won &apos;t be able to help you .
No one &apos;s seen Tom .
I &apos;m not going to do it .
I hope you &apos;re hungry .
I was convinced that he was guilty .
Tom is on his way home .
She can &apos;t stop talking .
My parents have been married for thirty years .
Where is your homework ?
She doesn &apos;t understand you .
Tom drank a lot yesterday .
I know a good lawyer who can help you .
Tom saw a doctor .
Tom wanted to fire Mary , but John stopped him .
Tom looked very old .
Tom found the work easy .
She &apos;s my daughter .
Which team will win the game ?
I don &apos;t hate him .
I don &apos;t like the house which he lives in .
I &apos;d prefer not to do that today .
Everybody knows us .
You &apos;re going to like this .
I want to eat .
This question isn &apos;t easy .
They were friends .
No one knows that .
I don &apos;t think this is how it &apos;s done .
I &apos;d be happy to go with you .
He is far from rich .
What am I going to do , Tom ?
You &apos;re not going to make me drink alone , are you ?
This movie is worth watching .
It &apos;s no secret that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom said he wanted to go swimming with us .
This guitar is so expensive that I can &apos;t buy it .
That &apos;s my suitcase .
Tom seemed to be very afraid .
Tom and Mary are the same age as John .
I can &apos;t believe that I &apos;m really here .
You can &apos;t sell it .
Can I talk to you a moment ?
Tom was late for work .
I &apos;m surprised to see you here .
I think Tom knows already .
I want my life back .
Now I know why Tom hates me .
Tom is going to explain it to all of us .
I don &apos;t understand a word of what you &apos;re saying .
&quot; Whose keys are these ? &quot; &quot; They are Mary &apos;s . &quot;
The only girl who ever really liked Tom was Mary .
The boy is wearing glasses .
Tom has what we all want .
I wish I could stay longer .
How long is that story ?
It made me very sad .
I like studying languages .
I &apos;ll never forget what you told me .
The doctor told him to cut down on smoking .
I rarely listen to the radio .
I &apos;ll be with you as soon as I finish this job .
You know where it is , don &apos;t you ?
When was the last time you were at your parents &apos; ?
I like summer better than winter .
Can you come ?
It isn &apos;t what I thought .
Tom won &apos;t be able to tell us anything .
They know where we are .
I didn &apos;t sleep long enough .
Do you have any idea where Tom might be waiting ?
Maybe what Tom said was true .
What do you want to do today ?
I &apos;m not going to go there .
We &apos;re not going to make it , Tom .
Everyone was killed .
Tom knew this would happen .
Have you already eaten lunch ?
I &apos;ll give you everything you need .
We can help you .
Don &apos;t be a bad boy .
Is it true that nobody lives around here ?
The picture is on the wall now .
Tom started dancing .
I &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
We always walk by the post office on the way to work .
This is exactly what we want .
I think that helped me .
Tom saw us do that .
Did Tom say why Mary went to Boston ?
I didn &apos;t know you had a cat .
Tom was a little surprised .
The beer &apos;s very cold .
I &apos;ll make some coffee .
Tom should have married Mary .
I think I remember you .
I know I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I work on the other side of town .
Maybe I should stop now .
Why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
Don &apos;t tell them the truth , OK ?
Tom wanted to meet me .
I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Tom is doing that for the money .
The trip will take at least a week .
I shouldn &apos;t be laughing .
Can you read it ?
That &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
This is Tom &apos;s dog .
I tried to stay awake .
We &apos;ve seen it before .
I don &apos;t want to have anything to do with that .
There &apos;s no reason for you to do that .
Have you had a chance to talk to Tom yet ?
I &apos;m in love with you .
He has never come on time that I know of .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go .
You can &apos;t smoke in this room .
You look like my sister .
How long did Tom say he &apos;d be in Boston ?
Tom is in his car waiting for Mary .
They &apos;re just students .
The television isn &apos;t working .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know whether he needs to do that or not .
Tom sat down near the window , put on his glasses and began to read the book that Mary had given him .
I &apos;m looking for my cat .
You should read this .
Is that what he wants ?
Tom asked me for my phone number .
Aren &apos;t you sisters ?
It was the only way to go .
I didn &apos;t think this was your seat .
I know where you are .
She finished her coffee and asked for another .
Tom doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s his fault .
I talked with her for an hour .
I didn &apos;t sleep all night .
Are you coming this evening ?
I want to talk to you about tomorrow .
How long have you been smoking ?
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
Tom fell off his chair .
She wants a new dress badly .
Have I disappointed you ?
I would like to go with you .
He was absent from school for a week .
I have a problem and I need your advice .
Why does Tom know that ?
I do not know when she will come back .
Tom is important .
It &apos;s just that I don &apos;t want to die today .
We were in love .
I should &apos;ve listened to my mother .
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow .
It &apos;s already been five years since we began to study English .
I &apos;m as strong as before .
Is he a teacher ?
I didn &apos;t know that you could do this .
My brother plays the guitar .
He is still young .
I guess you heard about Tom .
Everyone is happy .
Nobody knows this .
I &apos;ve already told Tom all I know .
You didn &apos;t work hard enough .
I think I just saw something .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what we wanted to know .
Tom is also studying French .
It must be hard for you .
Tom went without lunch because he didn &apos;t have enough time to eat .
Is Tom in there ?
I often get a letter from him .
Tom can &apos;t swim .
The door was already open .
They &apos;re more than friends .
I can &apos;t remember where I bought it .
I love my friends .
Tom died three years ago .
Why does Tom do that to himself ?
How are they doing it ?
In the summer , it is very hot here .
Tom has never won anything in his whole life .
I caught five fish yesterday .
She was only half alive .
I think this is too expensive .
Tell Tom about it .
I feel guilty .
I don &apos;t have a son named Tom .
I can &apos;t believe I actually thought Tom would change .
Tom didn &apos;t use to be like that .
She decided to study abroad .
I love my new apartment because it &apos;s very close to the station .
Tom isn &apos;t good at doing that .
You know some French , don &apos;t you ?
This is the book I want to read .
I like to drive .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not going to happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait that long .
I don &apos;t want you to think that I &apos;m not happy with your decision .
This is food .
We aren &apos;t in any danger , are we ?
Tom loves music .
Tom made the coffee too strong .
I was able to answer all the questions .
Do you eat meat ?
You will stay at home .
Who &apos;s that boy ?
Are you sure everything &apos;s OK ?
I really have to go .
Tom &apos;s mother lives in this village .
Where did you learn French ?
I just don &apos;t know why .
Tom ran as fast as he could .
I wonder what it would be like to be rich .
Tom would &apos;ve loved this movie .
He must have been rich .
Which city are you going to visit first ?
I find that pretty interesting .
I think you and I need to have a talk .
What &apos;s their plan ?
She promised her father to be in time for lunch .
I &apos;m at home .
He doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
Take Tom &apos;s place .
Your food &apos;s getting cold .
You know how Tom is .
Tom has no brothers .
He has been like a father to me .
It &apos;s rather cold .
She will give you what money she has .
Tom agreed to help us .
There &apos;s enough food for all of you .
I &apos;ve never read a novel in French .
She likes all of us .
It won &apos;t last long .
The store is just across from my house .
I like to do that .
We just finished .
I want an answer from you as soon as possible .
Have you ever played baseball ?
There &apos;s a new girl in school .
What would you like to do while you &apos;re here ?
We &apos;re looking for it .
I look like Tom .
I &apos;m really rich .
What &apos;s Tom still doing here ?
Tom can &apos;t keep his mouth shut .
What did I miss ?
You missed the meeting .
Take a break , Tom .
The problem is not what he said , but how he said it .
He doesn &apos;t understand me .
Tom will dance .
Tom didn &apos;t seem very busy .
Tom gave this to me .
What was it like living in Australia ?
Tom saw the bus .
Thank Tom for me .
We know this .
I &apos;d like to buy a map .
What makes you think you &apos;re better than me ?
I have a lot of things to do .
These clothes are too small for him .
We can talk about that later .
He had his car stolen yesterday .
We are brothers .
I can &apos;t walk .
Tom doesn &apos;t like my friends .
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour .
Tom ran up the stairs .
Tom can &apos;t even read .
I went to church every Sunday when I was a boy .
I don &apos;t know how to say it .
What did you feed the dog ?
He had to stay in bed .
I don &apos;t want you to make the same mistake I made .
You did lie .
Tom has a sister .
He asked me a question .
Tom is here because of me .
Why is the dog here ?
Tom showed us a picture of his mother .
After lunch today , our plan is to take a walk in the park .
Is it October already ?
Are you going , too ?
Why didn &apos;t you call ?
I know you think this is crazy .
I &apos;ll play tennis this evening .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was so old .
I want to know where Tom is .
He hasn &apos;t come yet .
We &apos;re going dancing today .
Excuse me , but will you tell me the way to the station ?
Tom can sing quite well .
If that &apos;s true , then Tom is innocent .
You disappointed me .
It &apos;s a good question .
He drank a beer .
She will be back at five .
Tom must &apos;ve been scared .
Everyone I know has been there .
I will go swimming tomorrow .
I want to know about you .
Does Tom have to be there ?
I don &apos;t like the way he speaks to me .
Can &apos;t someone else do this ?
I &apos;ll need some help .
I think I broke my leg .
Tom is going to tell the truth .
When I hear this song , I think of Tom .
How many people want to go swimming with us ?
How did you hear about that ?
I like studying French .
You have no idea who that is , do you ?
Tom was surprised when Mary caught a fish .
I remember it like it was yesterday .
You don &apos;t need to work today .
Are you sure , Tom ?
The letter will arrive in a week or so .
I came because of Tom .
Tom has been trying to get in touch with you .
I can &apos;t talk now .
How come you don &apos;t know this ?
It &apos;ll take a long time .
I don &apos;t know anybody here , except for Tom .
Tom knows why .
What are the two of you doing ?
Tom was drunk and he said some things he shouldn &apos;t have .
Tom has no children .
Who lives in that house ?
Tom is going to do it .
I don &apos;t like those people .
Come back soon .
Do you want this or not ?
I like winter better than summer .
I made a promise .
She took her pencil and started to write .
Tom is from another country .
We live near a big library .
She has already finished the work .
I prefer to travel in my car .
It makes all the difference .
Tom is in a good mood today .
Can you do that here ?
What do you want to eat ?
Tom didn &apos;t come home last night .
It is just five o &apos;clock .
Do whatever you like .
I &apos;m sure that Tom won &apos;t mind .
Where does that bus go ?
There &apos;s one more thing you need to do .
This house is large enough for your family to live in .
We don &apos;t have any time to waste .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that right now .
The moment he caught sight of me , he ran away .
I &apos;ll call back soon .
I &apos;m sad without you .
You should wait for Tom .
Let &apos;s meet at one o &apos;clock .
Is any of this true ?
I don &apos;t think Tom will hurt Mary .
Tom needed to wash his car .
Tom isn &apos;t missing .
Tom is still in Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m very proud of our students .
Tom and I get along fine .
Tom ran away .
She did not come until two .
I love being with Tom .
I think we &apos;re doing great .
Tom also smiled .
Tom talks funny .
I still don &apos;t know what happened .
Tom is outside waiting for Mary .
It hurts .
Did you tell Tom when to come ?
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school .
Someone needs to talk to Tom about what happened .
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early .
Tom asked me if I was all right .
Tom hasn &apos;t bought a new pair of shoes in three years .
Why don &apos;t you get one ?
He &apos;s able to speak Japanese .
He looked him up and down .
We &apos;ll hurry .
It seems that something has happened .
Where does your uncle live ?
He doesn &apos;t look happy .
I am completely against it .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school anymore .
Tom looks older .
Tom has already made up his mind .
Does Tom still go to school ?
I don &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
It &apos;s quite large .
I didn &apos;t stay there very long .
My dad is not home at the moment .
You have to sit down .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary in weeks .
Do you know what day it is today ?
Tom kept laughing .
Will he get well soon ?
I knew better than to ask questions .
Why are you scared of Tom ?
He never speaks of the accident .
I can &apos;t take my eyes off her .
Tom is being very kind today .
It &apos;s your turn , Tom .
Can I say something ?
He gave up his life for his country .
Let &apos;s see if Tom is in his office .
I love Tom so much .
Has anybody spoken to Tom ?
Tom &apos;s very nice .
Tom will be a good teacher .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do it again .
Tom is a good doctor .
He likes to read books .
I hope he comes tomorrow .
Tom used to drink .
I had nothing to do with her .
I didn &apos;t care if anyone saw me .
Tom told Mary he loved Alice .
I would like to go to Japan .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d like a cup of coffee .
I want the address .
Tom seems to be very happy to be here .
Tom will never know it was you who told me .
I hear from him once in a while .
I know you &apos;re confused .
When did that happen ?
I want to be in Boston .
Would you like to walk to the station with me ?
What time do you go to work ?
Can you come for dinner tonight ?
I speak English .
I want us to be together .
I think Tom can help .
The door was still closed .
I want a lawyer .
You are the man I &apos;ve been looking for .
I had enough money to buy that dress .
We &apos;re not all like that .
I am very tall .
Today I turn four years old .
I am going to my room , where I can study .
It &apos;s kind of hard to explain .
What do you and Tom want to do ?
Tom told me to do it , so I did it .
I was able to answer the question .
Are you free this afternoon ?
Tom must decide .
Is there anywhere you want to go ?
Tom had no idea how Mary was feeling .
Where have you been ? I was worried sick .
I think it &apos;s time to start getting ready .
I &apos;ll certainly do this .
Tom is a few months older than Mary .
Why are men like that ?
The water was cold .
Tom is no longer alive .
Tom and I have been friends for years .
Do you have any more questions ?
You &apos;ve got a lot of work ahead of you .
I &apos;m glad Tom enjoyed it .
I &apos;m way younger than Tom thinks I am .
How much is it ?
You shouldn &apos;t laugh at Tom when he makes mistakes .
Tom is there .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been there .
I &apos;m kind of into that .
She made him a new coat .
What do you suggest ?
Look there .
I think you should get more rest .
Please take one .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m going .
I know something is wrong , but I &apos;m not quite sure what .
Do you know where you are ?
Tom was still in the classroom when I left .
Tom is OK , isn &apos;t he ?
&quot; I don &apos;t understand this &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand it either . &quot;
That is a good idea .
I &apos;m happy to be here .
You don &apos;t want to talk to me , do you ?
He put his money in the box .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Australia .
They called .
I &apos;m ready now .
I know it very well .
Tom and Mary were sitting across the table from John and Alice .
You said that last time .
I &apos;m glad you asked me for advice .
You &apos;ve got no right to say that .
Tom wants to thank you , too .
I ate too much today .
He was too young to live alone .
Tom didn &apos;t want to sell his house .
Why don &apos;t we go in ?
I &apos;ll call you up later .
Tom &apos;s best friend is Mary .
I like to drink milk .
They don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
Tom may not be as hungry as you think he is .
He thinks only about himself .
What were you doing at Tom &apos;s house ?
Tom said Mary was really drunk .
I have a cat and a dog .
I know you &apos;ll like Tom .
I don &apos;t have to say a word .
I was just asking a question .
I have trouble talking about my feelings .
I don &apos;t think I know the answer .
If you &apos;re happy , I &apos;m happy .
Tom has got a plan .
Tom wants to finish eating before he talks to anyone .
I &apos;m not feeling too great .
This is a present for you .
Tom has written three books .
Everything has changed .
I prefer my own company .
I don &apos;t want to see Tom do that .
I &apos;ve been looking for a girl like you .
They already know the truth .
Do you want something to eat ?
No matter how old you get , you can still learn .
I quit smoking two years ago .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone .
I &apos;m not going to stop .
I &apos;ll be back in about an hour .
Why do I have to do this ?
How did you come by the money ?
Tom is smart .
Tom left right away .
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that that has happened .
I won &apos;t laugh .
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago .
If I had time , I could help you .
I was feeling blue .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time to help Mary right now .
Tom shouldn &apos;t always believe what others say .
I &apos;m not happy about that .
What do you think I should &apos;ve said ?
Tom put his shoes on .
Tom couldn &apos;t find anyone to talk to .
That &apos;s a fish .
She ran as fast as possible .
I can &apos;t live any longer without him .
I can &apos;t really remember .
I will be busy next week .
No , I didn &apos;t write it .
I think you went too far .
Would you like to know who did that ?
I don &apos;t have as much money as you think .
We could go there now .
I love you more than he loves you .
Let &apos;s go by car .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave now .
Who saw what ?
Many people came to the meeting yesterday .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure .
I &apos;ve decided not to swim this afternoon .
Could you tell me something about yourself ?
He &apos;s on his last legs .
Everyone likes them .
Tom said he was too tired to dance .
You &apos;re not trying hard enough .
Not everybody is the same .
You have three cars .
I expect that Tom will win .
You &apos;re young .
Let him do it .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
You &apos;re not thinking .
That was to be expected .
You &apos;ve upset Tom .
I don &apos;t care what Tom wears .
I asked Tom if he wanted to drive .
Tom wanted you to see it right away .
How did you come to school ?
I have more experience than Tom .
Why don &apos;t you eat vegetables ?
What are you going to see ?
Do you know Tom &apos;s phone number ?
I know those women .
Tom has such beautiful eyes .
I just ate .
I let Tom do that yesterday .
I can do this myself .
Tom and Mary eat lunch together every day .
It almost happened .
You &apos;re not my type .
Who does Tom do that with ?
I &apos;d like to know your opinion .
No one loves you like I do .
He threw me the apple .
I want to be what you want me to be .
Tom tried to sing Mary to sleep .
Do you want to come sit by me ?
Tom saw Mary with John .
It &apos;s been a long night .
Tom didn &apos;t know how long the meeting would last .
I don &apos;t know what Tom told you , but it might not be true .
I have something to tell you .
Tom isn &apos;t in prison anymore .
Today &apos;s my daughter &apos;s birthday .
You &apos;ll have to come here .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done that .
The kid already speaks pretty well .
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning ?
Tom is going to have to do that .
I want to be as happy as Tom .
Tom goes to bed at 10 : 30 .
I &apos;m so happy for you both .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t worry .
She looked sad because I was angry .
I knew you &apos;d miss me .
Tom said you &apos;d know .
I &apos;ve been busy since yesterday .
The box was full of books .
Who was invited to the party ?
He doesn &apos;t care a bit about me .
You &apos;re supposed to meet Tom in front of his hotel in about an hour .
How long do you plan to stay ?
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be of more help .
May I speak to Tom ?
Are you impressed ?
Tom is dead now .
This coat doesn &apos;t fit me .
No one I know talks to Tom anymore .
Tom eats very quickly .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary for a long time .
Tom hasn &apos;t changed very much .
If only it were that simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
I was reading a book .
Let &apos;s talk about it after school .
Do it once again .
Where are you going this afternoon ?
Tom won &apos;t do that again .
What &apos;s the weather like in Boston ?
I need to ask you some more questions .
Don &apos;t move , please .
Tom isn &apos;t heavy .
I didn &apos;t know you had a girlfriend .
What did you promise to do ?
I &apos;m happy for Tom .
Can you read this without your glasses ?
Please write down what I say .
I &apos;m no longer married .
Don &apos;t keep me waiting here like this .
He died ten years ago .
My father died five years ago .
Tom likes to read .
How hot is it going to get ?
Would you leave the door open , please ?
What are you going to do with that ?
I spent the whole day in the park .
You &apos;d better go . It &apos;s getting late .
Someone &apos;s talking .
I know I &apos;m good enough .
He doesn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
You don &apos;t have to talk about it if you don &apos;t want to .
Let &apos;s start right away .
You have very little time left .
I &apos;m interested in doing that , but Tom isn &apos;t .
We didn &apos;t get much done today .
I want to go .
I want to go , too .
Tom promised us he &apos;d help Mary .
Tom was a little worried .
Do you want me to help you do that ?
He &apos;s very lonely .
Tom can &apos;t drive .
Tom noticed that he and Mary were finally alone together .
I can &apos;t put up with this noise .
The rain hasn &apos;t stopped yet , has it ?
Are these all your books , Tom ?
Tom drinks too much .
Tom &apos;s looking for work .
Some people are for the plan and others are against it .
I lost my glasses .
Let me help .
I wish I had a car .
Tom &apos;s car broke down .
Tom got up and walked into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee .
Where are you all going so early in the morning ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve always loved about you .
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need ?
I love my father .
The man asked me for some money .
I thought I heard something outside .
Will you go , too ?
I get what you &apos;re saying .
I don &apos;t trust you .
You have to go there whether you like it or not .
Are you here with someone ?
I eat rice .
He will be talking with his family at this time tomorrow .
I &apos;ve got good news .
I have to know what &apos;s going on .
Come on , I &apos;ll give you a ride home .
I have a feeling that we may win .
Tom didn &apos;t want to lose his wife .
What do you have in your bag ?
I asked him to open the window .
I &apos;m finished .
Nobody takes me anywhere .
You &apos;re my son .
Nobody saw me .
There &apos;s nobody in the house . Everybody &apos;s outside .
His name is Tom and he lives next to the post office .
I &apos;d rather not do this anymore .
We had a little water .
I &apos;m sure that our team will win .
We will be together forever .
I met a friend of Mary &apos;s .
I &apos;m not the problem .
What do you guys want to do ?
Are you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
I know that you still love me .
Tom really scared you , didn &apos;t he ?
Tom showed interest in the plan .
Can I call you Tom ?
How long does it take by car ?
The movie wasn &apos;t as funny as the book .
Mary is still living at home with her parents .
How old will you be next year ?
Do you have much money with you ?
Take as much as you want to .
I asked him a question .
She is not always happy .
How are you not seeing that ?
What did Tom want us to do ?
We &apos;ll do all we can .
I know this .
I can &apos;t leave Tom behind .
I wish Tom would come to Boston .
I just don &apos;t love Tom .
I wonder what will happen .
I will call you in an hour .
The beach isn &apos;t far from here .
I don &apos;t want you with me .
You should have told me about the problem sooner .
Don &apos;t forget your bag .
Tom needs you .
How much is that all together ?
Tom is a good man .
Tom wanted to know when it happened .
Tom speaks French much better than English .
Tom has been studying French for about three years .
I &apos;m really happy we got to know each other .
Tom looked old .
Tom wrote that Mary was in the hospital .
How often do you go to the beach ?
You &apos;re not too old for this job .
Tom kept walking .
I wanted them to win .
Tom didn &apos;t go home .
I don &apos;t feel like working .
What do you think of Boston ?
It may never happen again .
That &apos;s pretty serious .
What should I eat for lunch today ?
Tom is in Australia , it seems .
Tom wanted to marry Mary .
I am your friend , right ?
Tom knows I &apos;m Canadian .
Can I go with you ?
I don &apos;t know how I did this .
I want you to tell me the truth .
I don &apos;t want to play tennis this afternoon .
I don &apos;t really know why he wrote the book .
We &apos;ll find that out soon enough .
You &apos;re totally right .
You should wash your hands .
Tom wondered whether Mary would like the gift he bought her .
That &apos;s not possible .
Tom didn &apos;t even like baseball .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be poor .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know Mary was able to speak French .
Are you able to speak French ?
Tom decided .
He usually goes to school by bus .
Tom knows too much .
Tom didn &apos;t mind .
It &apos;s four o &apos;clock by my watch .
Do you want the job ?
I &apos;m going to do you a favor .
You don &apos;t look happy .
My father gets along with his friends .
Tom is out of the office .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like that .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to find me .
Where &apos;s the newspaper ?
She may be cute , but I don &apos;t like her .
What &apos;s Tom after ?
There is only one store on the whole island .
What &apos;re you doing with those ?
Tom was the last to leave .
It has to stop .
What I need is not money , but your advice .
What is it you want , Tom ?
I think we &apos;re going to be fine .
I didn &apos;t know you could do this .
I didn &apos;t even know his name .
Don &apos;t you ever call me again .
My sister &apos;s going to kill me .
Your French is good .
Tom and Mary were here .
Tom isn &apos;t the same age as Mary .
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised to see Mary with John .
We know you &apos;re very rich .
My work is almost finished .
What do you eat for lunch ?
Tom will succeed .
Tom will never understand why people don &apos;t like him .
He tried speaking French to us .
You forgot to thank Tom for the present , didn &apos;t you ?
I want to know why you lied .
I said I didn &apos;t know Tom .
I &apos;m not very busy .
Tom took Mary to the hospital .
Don &apos;t lose heart .
What would I do without Tom ?
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have enough money to buy that .
I called him up , but he wasn &apos;t there .
He likes taking care of the garden .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
You &apos;re never too old to learn .
I want to live with you .
Tom became famous all over the world .
I heard that you &apos;re not going home either .
I changed my address last month .
I &apos;ve read this book before .
He eats too much .
I &apos;m supposed to see Tom .
People need love .
How long has he been dead ?
Monday is the only day of the week that I don &apos;t get home before 2 : 30 .
Tom is not a student .
I don &apos;t feel like studying French today .
That &apos;s not what I want .
Tom asked Mary where her mother was .
I know that Tom isn &apos;t a Canadian .
Tom knows why Mary is here .
What &apos;s happened to your eye ?
How can that be ?
Most of the dogs are alive .
I know next to nothing .
My uncle is angry .
Tom had an accident at work .
Tom told her .
Where are the apples ?
What do you know about Mary &apos;s boyfriend ?
When did she get married ?
She runs faster than I do .
Tom quit smoking .
Bring me the dictionary .
Tom is rich , but not me .
I &apos;ve eaten enough .
You need to tell Tom the truth .
I like that answer .
I know that Tom is out .
I &apos;ve been living in Boston for three years .
If the weather is good , I &apos;ll go .
Tom won &apos;t ever forget what happened today .
I don &apos;t love her .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like that .
We learn to read and write .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to cook very well .
I think you &apos;ll want this .
You had better tell me now .
Tom and Mary were in the garden .
I will not help you .
I have everything I wanted .
This is my brother .
My dog is big .
I &apos;ve finally learned how to do that .
Tom has quit smoking .
Do you believe it now ?
What kind of help do you need ?
I &apos;ll be with Tom and Mary .
You need to apologize to her and need to do it right away .
That &apos;s because you &apos;re a girl .
Maybe it &apos;s true .
Take Tom inside .
She bought a dictionary for her sister .
Leave it to me .
Tom told me he was cold .
I &apos;ve just come to Boston .
He has been in Japan for two years .
You should leave me alone .
Stop telling everyone you &apos;re my brother .
You go to school , don &apos;t you ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to leave .
Tom seemed to know the truth .
Tom lives in an apartment .
Tom is going .
Tom ate an apple .
Tom won &apos;t believe I did that .
Is Tom happy ?
I can &apos;t see who Tom is talking to .
How &apos;re you doing at home ?
There &apos;s been an accident .
Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight .
Tom made it easy for me .
How long have you been in this country ?
Tom says it &apos;s important .
He really likes music a lot .
How does Tom come to school ?
Did Tom stay ?
You should know better .
You haven &apos;t got a chance .
I didn &apos;t catch any fish .
Are we ready for it ?
Do you want to look at it ?
I wasn &apos;t expecting that .
It sounds good to me .
Tom went to his room and sat down on his bed .
Tom and Mary have a big house .
Who was it that gave that to you ?
This cat is as big as that one .
Did you find anything else ?
Tom said that Mary was willing to help us do that .
This book isn &apos;t as interesting as that book .
I miss Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was from Boston .
It &apos;ll take you too long .
What are you saying ?
I want you out of here .
Tom is a policeman .
I &apos;ll go and get you a doctor .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary , but he &apos;d like to meet her .
I &apos;ve been waiting for hours .
The doctor told Tom that he should eat a lot of vegetables .
He won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
Tom isn &apos;t there .
He let his books fall to the floor .
Some of my friends can speak English well .
Tom and Mary are doing that with John .
I can &apos;t remember where I first met Tom .
There &apos;s no need to apologize .
I don &apos;t need any help with my homework .
I &apos;ve got a few questions .
Tom just wanted some sleep .
Tom is sure Mary is right .
I couldn &apos;t stop them .
I was happy yesterday .
Don &apos;t be sad .
Tom has thought of everything .
Are both of you ready to go ?
We can try .
She plays tennis after school .
I &apos;ve run out of milk .
Can you help me ?
Tom drives very fast .
I want a kitchen like this .
Tom helped Mary on the bus , and then got on himself .
I know it well .
My son is taller than me .
That &apos;s not Tom &apos;s fault .
She &apos;s probably just scared .
I like playing baseball .
Please give it a try .
We sat on a bench in the park .
Perhaps I &apos;ll like this book .
My mother must be angry .
How did she get such an idea into her head ?
He ran out of money .
Tom and I became very good friends .
What do you think of my plan ?
Tom made a lot of money .
Tom just never should &apos;ve done that .
Can I speak to Tom ?
Tom can barely read .
I want time .
I &apos;ll call Tom on Monday .
In my opinion , she is correct .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that last night ?
We haven &apos;t seen you in the past four years .
Tom is like that .
Why are people here ?
I have a friend who speaks French very well .
This is your big chance .
You &apos;re old enough now .
How long have you known this ?
Do you want to go or not ?
I prefer it that way .
I &apos;ve seen Tom .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re glad .
I was at home then .
Tom said he thought that he &apos;d be able to do that today .
Are we all happy ?
We love our children .
I don &apos;t think Tom needs our help .
I want to know who did this .
I found this movie very interesting .
Tom may do that with Mary .
They &apos;re watching .
I took a day off .
I can &apos;t give you the answer today .
I was a little nervous .
You need not do it at once .
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t read many books .
There is a little milk left in the bottle .
Let me explain it once more .
I &apos;m serious .
Tom is very good to Mary .
Has Tom done that recently ?
Go and apologize to Tom .
Tom loves me .
She &apos;s eating for two .
I think someone &apos;s at the door .
Do it again , Tom .
Isn &apos;t that good enough ?
I wonder whether Tom will help us .
Why do you keep giving him money ?
He &apos;s mad at everyone .
I don &apos;t think Tom would do that on purpose .
What &apos;s Tom up to ?
I don &apos;t want to see Tom .
All I think about is you .
I just have one question .
I &apos;ll be at home .
I can &apos;t stay for long .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary .
You &apos;d better tell him the truth .
I ate too much .
That &apos;s been tried .
You would like it .
You should never ask a woman how old she is .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice were all there .
Don &apos;t give up on me .
Do you want to come with us ?
Tom wants me to do that .
He looks happy .
We &apos;re going to make it .
I took a taxi from the station to the hotel .
Who said it was going to be easy ?
He has a big family .
I think this is mine .
Where is it ?
I spoke with him about the matter .
I have a right to be happy .
Tom told me he was innocent .
I wish that you hadn &apos;t told me that .
Can I have a moment ?
Tom and Mary were alone in the park .
We &apos;ve already learned a lot .
I don &apos;t think I want to study French with you .
This tree is dead and should be cut down .
Did you leave the door open ?
I forgot something in my car .
Do as you please .
It &apos;s the voice of an old woman .
I &apos;m real sorry I wasn &apos;t able to help .
How do you like your new apartment ?
It &apos;ll have to wait .
It &apos;s happening tonight .
I can &apos;t stay long today .
Tell Tom I &apos;m not hungry .
Please teach me French .
I &apos;m sorry , my boss is sleeping right now . Please come back tomorrow .
Tom and Mary are doing fine .
This is my room .
Nobody talked about the movie .
I have been busy .
He did nothing wrong .
Have you ever heard of him ?
I can &apos;t read your mind .
He stuck the book in his bag .
I am fine .
I slept all day yesterday , because it was Sunday .
Are you afraid of getting hurt ?
I decided to become a doctor .
I don &apos;t like it when people make fun of me .
Tom still loves Mary even though she doesn &apos;t love him anymore .
I &apos;ll finish it in two or three minutes .
Mary has big eyes .
This is where Tom wants to live .
Do you want to dance ?
His story may not be true .
The job &apos;s not done yet .
Tom almost never makes a mistake .
What &apos;re you doing here ?
Tom waited more than an hour .
We can &apos;t go back to Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that the way he should be .
I gave her just what she needed .
What have you got there in your pocket ?
I work in a hospital .
Tom is sorry .
I &apos;m not looking forward to the evening .
I think he doesn &apos;t like it here .
Tell me what has become of him .
That man &apos;s helped my family a lot .
She was a great help to me .
How is the weather outside ?
Tom is difficult .
Tom was the last one to finish eating .
She said she was happy .
Tom won &apos;t be doing that anymore .
Are you there , Tom ?
This is not a game .
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary .
Will it be a difficult exam ?
Tom picked something up off the floor .
That &apos;s a very good question .
We are going to have a baby next month .
I have nothing to do with them .
I made that one .
I go to school every day .
I &apos;ve got to get back to work .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary is now .
If you &apos;ve got something to say , say it .
What have you been up to ?
Why don &apos;t you watch TV ?
We need to know everything that you know about the situation .
I never had a girlfriend before .
Excuse me .
I wish I was with you .
I can &apos;t believe you actually said that .
I don &apos;t come here very often .
It wasn &apos;t a party .
I don &apos;t swim as well as you do .
I &apos;m really looking forward to meeting Tom .
What impressed you the most ?
I &apos;d like you to read this book .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you .
This student &apos;s books are new .
How do they know ?
Is he dead ?
That &apos;s how I got to know her .
The wind is cold today .
My son is taller than I am .
That was a mistake .
I don &apos;t want this .
We sat there .
Why are you home ?
I lost sight of Tom .
Both of you ought to do that .
I never learned about any of this in school .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
Tom said that he &apos;d look at it .
Tom loves me and I love him , too .
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow .
Are you sure his name is Tom ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell us you knew French ?
Why are you here ?
Tom can &apos;t decide whether to buy a new computer now or wait for a couple of more months .
My joke went over very well .
Who did you talk with ?
I &apos;m Canadian .
I like music very much .
My mother is a teacher .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that .
I &apos;d like to go to Boston .
I know that Tom is a doctor .
It has been raining for two days .
Tom said he didn &apos;t like the concert at all .
Do you wish to go ?
What kind of questions will they ask ?
You said you loved me .
Have you ever seen Tom and Mary dancing together ?
That happens to me all the time .
Tom almost laughed .
They don &apos;t like Tom .
I had fun at school today .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to be interested .
Tom and Mary are both in the classroom .
It &apos;ll be over in a moment .
Our teacher is always on time for class .
We &apos;re losing .
Tom has two sisters .
Whose baby is that ?
Tom and Mary are in love .
Tom called a taxi for me .
We probably shouldn &apos;t have done that .
It &apos;s as simple as that .
No questions were asked .
I &apos;ve decided to go by train .
I used to go to school with him .
Bring your kids , too .
I am proud of never being late for school .
She &apos;s a dog .
I can afford one , but not both .
We need to know what happened .
Tom may have to help Mary .
He noticed a letter on the desk .
Tom and Mary meant everything they said .
I said we &apos;d get one .
I know what they are thinking .
He ought to have arrived home by now .
I think that we should forget about this .
Tom said he was glad he didn &apos;t do that .
Please go to the bank .
I can &apos;t tell you that yet .
These are new .
Where did you learn this ?
I helped my father wash his car .
It looks like Tom isn &apos;t at home .
I &apos;d be glad to go in your place .
Let &apos;s take the stairs .
Mary has not started yet .
Tom is somewhere in the building .
I was absent from school because I was sick .
I hope not .
What is it that you do , exactly ?
Tom isn &apos;t like his brother .
I &apos;m not interested in what you think .
I &apos;ll meet her tomorrow .
They &apos;re not going to give up on us .
Tom came to see Mary .
I got to know Tom when I was a university student .
I accept the offer .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t think John did that with Alice .
I &apos;m just being honest .
I thought that Tom might be able to help us .
&quot; Where are your books ? &quot; &quot; They are on the desk . &quot;
Tom was waiting for Mary .
I saw Tom before he saw me .
Tom put his suitcase down next to Mary &apos;s .
Tom asked Mary if she needed some help .
I don &apos;t read this kind of book much .
I think that would be good .
Are you certain ?
We &apos;re all scared .
I am only too glad to help you with your work .
Who is he talking to ?
We had nothing to do with it .
Tom is going to live with us .
I can &apos;t ever be what you were .
I need your help , Tom .
I like studying English .
Tom and I did that .
Tom couldn &apos;t talk .
It &apos;s almost October .
It is possible for you to read this book in a few days .
She liked him right off .
Do you have anything else to say ?
This tie doesn &apos;t go with my suit .
Tom is my younger brother .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom if I may .
Maybe they &apos;re friends .
We must not go to war again .
How often have you done that ?
We do what we want to do .
We were both very hungry .
She had no brother .
When did you quit smoking ?
I &apos;m proud of my children .
We are going to travel by car .
May I use this telephone ?
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him .
Do you know those people ?
I told her to sit down and to drink a glass of water .
I want to know all about you .
I know your brother very well .
Tom is writing a letter to Mary .
Who are those children ?
Are you afraid of death ?
That &apos;s enough for today .
I think I &apos;ll take Tom to Boston with me .
I forgot your phone number .
Have you ever heard someone speaking French ?
She left here right away .
I &apos;m very proud of my father .
She did not read the book .
You &apos;ve been a great help .
We have a few more hours before Tom gets here .
You know I &apos;m married .
Tom thinks he can trust Mary .
Tom smiled when Mary entered the room .
I can &apos;t trust you anymore .
You have to ask Tom first .
It happened .
We never expected this .
This is a book .
This is my husband .
What kind of teacher do you want to be ?
Tom looked up at the sky .
This hat &apos;s too small for you .
When he comes , I &apos;ll pay the money that I promised .
Tom didn &apos;t know how to help Mary .
What do you have in your suitcase ?
I &apos;ll give Tom one more chance .
I think it &apos;s somewhere around here .
How long were you in Boston ?
We don &apos;t talk much .
Tom is getting rich .
They are pretty .
I &apos;m waiting for my girlfriend .
He sometimes ate out with his family .
Both of my parents have passed away .
Is the apple red ?
Did you call me up last night ?
Did you learn that from Tom ?
Tell Tom what that means .
Tom didn &apos;t read the book .
I &apos;m lonely without you .
I have some money .
I don &apos;t want to say that to Tom .
You can only use it once .
Tom is right over there .
Tom opened his mouth to say something .
I heard someone calling my name .
Was I asleep for long ?
Maybe we should talk again tomorrow .
I don &apos;t believe this is true .
I spent the whole day in the library .
This is where I live .
I have to do it again .
I didn &apos;t want that to happen .
&quot; I saw her five days ago , &quot; he said .
Her plan is dangerous .
The girl standing over there is Mary .
Do you like Boston ?
Tom seems worried .
Tom told me about it .
Tom gave me what I needed .
They haven &apos;t arrived yet .
That &apos;s what Tom wants .
What you &apos;re doing is wrong .
I don &apos;t know how I should do it .
Tom is helping .
She put her head out of the window .
I &apos;m used to eating alone .
I think it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
I go to school by bus .
What &apos;ve you been doing recently ?
I like Boston a lot .
That was the trouble .
Did Tom talk about it ?
The only girl Tom has ever kissed is Mary .
I know that Tom is from Boston .
Tell it to him , not me !
You don &apos;t need to come so early .
I &apos;ll tell the others .
The report cannot be true .
He is very tall .
We expect him tomorrow at ten o &apos;clock .
I tried to get Tom to help me .
They don &apos;t understand me when I speak French .
I want you to go home .
May I ask about your family ?
Do you realize what you &apos;re doing ?
You can &apos;t do two things at once .
I &apos;ve never heard him speak ill of others .
People want to feel safe .
I don &apos;t know about that .
I heard you were planning to move to Australia .
He hardly ever works .
Has Tom told Mary that he &apos;s married ?
That &apos;s my sister .
I can &apos;t meet Tom now .
Where does Tom want to live ?
I know what I have to do .
The children were not to blame for the accident .
Bring it back to me .
What are you wearing tonight ?
What do you think it is ?
They say that he was in the hospital at that time .
Tom smiled at Mary .
We don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
Tom and Mary come from the same town .
There &apos;s something I need to give you .
What &apos;s Tom going to say ?
I sat between Tom and John .
Tom has been studying in his room since dinner .
Tom said that he wanted to learn French .
It sounds easy .
I &apos;ll do what Tom says .
He lives in his car .
I want to do everything I &apos;m expected to do .
I &apos;m not going to ask you again .
Tom put his hat on and went outside .
Please let me go .
Tom likes Boston .
How long are you going to stay in Japan ?
Do we have enough milk ?
He looked at me in surprise .
Let go of Tom .
I said take it .
You know , don &apos;t you ?
Are all of your sisters older than you ?
Which is your book ?
Tom wants you dead .
I wonder what that means .
Tom made it clear that he didn &apos;t like Mary very much .
There are only three days left .
Why did you do that ?
Tom didn &apos;t say a word to me .
I know where they &apos;re going .
You don &apos;t even know his name , do you ?
Tom did it , didn &apos;t he ?
Is there any place you want to go ?
Tom has to go to the hospital .
She stopped talking .
I think we &apos;re all a bit crazy .
We &apos;ve got everything we need .
Tom was thirty .
She knew what needed to be done .
Did you tell Tom the truth ?
What do you do after dinner ?
Tom lives on this street .
I wouldn &apos;t want to live in Boston .
Tom will have a hard time doing that .
Your friends will miss you .
Everybody &apos;s talking .
He didn &apos;t come on time .
I ran to my mother .
What &apos;ll you do with Tom ?
How about going swimming ?
Tom wanted to wait for the next bus .
Is that your book ?
These are your things .
Tom wanted to stay .
Tom was there yesterday .
I think we made it .
You can &apos;t believe anybody .
I &apos;m mad at you .
Tom waited for three hours .
Tom isn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom likes fruit .
He looks confused .
I made a list .
What do I need ?
I &apos;m really mad at Tom right now .
We drink our tea with sugar .
You &apos;re not here .
I couldn &apos;t believe what I was seeing .
How are you two doing ?
Be careful . I don &apos;t want you to hurt yourself .
I &apos;m not going to name names .
Don &apos;t you see what that means ?
I don &apos;t have time for this .
She took my hand .
Why weren &apos;t you at home yesterday ?
Tom fell asleep in class .
This I have to see .
I knew you &apos;d be hungry .
I &apos;m studying French at home .
She suggested that he try it .
I feel much better today .
Is she here yet ?
Did you break up with Tom ?
Tom died suddenly .
Tom may have been sleeping at the time .
Why &apos;s Tom so good at French ?
I &apos;ll be happy to go .
This is too easy for him .
I hope you &apos;re doing well .
If I &apos;d taken that plane , I wouldn &apos;t be alive now .
I can &apos;t believe I listened to you .
I &apos;m learning French now .
It &apos;s not funny anymore .
Your parents must &apos;ve been worried .
I &apos;m now married .
The children ate first .
Tom bought a dog .
What are you two doing out here ?
I won &apos;t forget you , Tom .
Why don &apos;t you look for a job ?
Tom went back to the table .
Tom didn &apos;t want my help .
That &apos;s not what I wanted hear .
They agree .
I asked Tom not to tell Mary .
Tom asked me to ask you something .
Tom &apos;s name was at the top of the list .
Tom knew too much .
May I ask you some questions about your name ?
She happened to know his address .
Tom put it in the box .
I know almost nothing about Boston .
Would you like for me to make you something to eat ?
You &apos;ve found a good man .
The man ate bread .
How would you like it if someone did that to you ?
The last piece of cake was eaten by Tom .
Tom hasn &apos;t been to Australia yet .
You &apos;re not going to believe this .
That &apos;s not what we do .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes Mary .
Can you please tell me how I can get to the beach ?
They did not work , either .
Come home at once .
What has Tom done wrong ?
Today , we turn ten years old .
I don &apos;t have books to read .
Tom has been abroad for three years .
What are they going to do to me ?
I am older than him .
The store was not a big one , was it ?
This used to be my room .
Tom played with the baby .
Where can we meet ?
Tom took off his coat because it was getting too hot to wear it .
I don &apos;t know where Tom used to live .
We &apos;ve got no choice .
Many people were there .
All the other kids do it .
Do I have to come on Monday ?
He is always scared .
I don &apos;t want to hear any more .
I can &apos;t feel at home in a hotel .
Have you found an answer to this question ?
Tom needs to make a decision .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to work .
I mean what I say .
I &apos;m sure Tom will be absent .
The one who has everything can lose everything .
We will talk over the matter later .
Is Tom alone now ?
You may use my car .
I can &apos;t do it anymore .
Tom smiled back .
I won &apos;t ask you anything else today .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m all out of money .
You don &apos;t know that .
I have to get Tom home .
I still don &apos;t like Australia very much .
I don &apos;t remember seeing it before .
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle .
We &apos;re young .
We &apos;ve got to take care of it .
Tom is expected to come home soon .
Who bought this ?
I have three times as many books as Tom does .
Why don &apos;t you come on in ?
The cake is in the kitchen .
I wish Tom was here .
What &apos;s in the bag ?
How am I going to do that ?
We saw you .
What &apos;s up with Tom ?
Did you give Tom my phone number ?
You don &apos;t know what to do next , do you ?
Where &apos;s my computer ?
I &apos;ll show you how to do it .
He wrote a letter yesterday .
You can &apos;t leave now .
Tom said it was your fault .
Tom only seems to be busy in the morning .
He eats a lot .
Don &apos;t bother to come to my house .
His name is Tom , not John .
I &apos;m at the airport right now .
Tom told Mary that he thought John was home .
Tom looks fine .
Nobody ever found her cat .
We can &apos;t help you anymore .
His teeth were white .
I don &apos;t blame you .
What does Tom really want ?
I thought Tom said he wasn &apos;t going to get married .
Tom is in Australia .
I do not fear death .
He has a brother and two sisters .
You did your part .
What is the student population at your college ?
Tom watched TV all day .
I really like this car .
It is important to help each other .
This is too much for me .
I &apos;m the one who made that decision .
What &apos;s this ?
This looks good .
This watch is my father &apos;s .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
I &apos;ll talk with you when you &apos;re not busy .
We &apos;ve got to go .
I already told my parents .
Tom has been waiting for Mary for more than three hours .
Tom told me he was studying French .
Can I borrow $ 30 ?
Let &apos;s go dancing .
Tom was interested .
All women are the same .
Tom can &apos;t stop .
When did you get back home ?
Aren &apos;t you students ?
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
Tom had company .
I am not convinced that this is the case .
He can &apos;t explain what happened .
Tom had a good reason for not going .
You &apos;re no younger than I am .
You &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
There isn &apos;t any solution .
Tom likes his job .
I want Tom to do it .
I used to walk to school .
What &apos;s the meeting going to be about ?
I forgot that Tom spoke French .
I think you &apos;re in my seat .
Tom goes there every day .
You are tired , aren &apos;t you ?
Tell Tom I &apos;d like to talk to him .
You can &apos;t tell anyone about this .
I don &apos;t think Tom is finished .
How did you first meet Tom ?
It is said that he knows the secret .
Why are you still here ?
I really enjoyed that .
We &apos;re happy with our car .
Tom knew that Mary was rich .
I &apos;m getting good at this .
My eyes hurt .
The shirt that I &apos;ve just bought is very nice .
I am a college student .
My friend asked me if I was feeling all right .
I &apos;m still working on this .
Can I go now ?
Tom let Mary do whatever she wanted to do .
I don &apos;t care what it is .
There &apos;s just too few hours in the day .
We &apos;re going to go .
I didn &apos;t kiss anyone .
We want our money .
Tom asked Mary to tell him about the house she had lived in when she was a child .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary is .
He wrote three books in three years .
I &apos;ll have someone take you home .
I really don &apos;t know him .
I &apos;d love to come and visit .
That would be a mistake .
Tom has three children .
I think that Tom is sick .
Tom caught many fish .
You don &apos;t have to do what Tom says .
You had better stop smoking .
Tom raised his hand .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be back before long .
I believe Tom is innocent .
I &apos;ve never spoken with Tom in French .
Tom felt confused .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t been married long .
What would you have done in my place ?
Tom is a good boy .
It was stupid of me to believe that !
I &apos;m not ready .
I don &apos;t remember anything about it .
Tom is married to Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
Ask Tom to help you .
I didn &apos;t read the book .
I have Tom &apos;s key .
Tom wasn &apos;t listening .
I can wait no longer .
Don &apos;t forget .
We &apos;d love to work with you .
A beer , please .
I think I &apos;ll take it .
They &apos;re going to do it .
I think Tom wants me to do that .
My father has gone to China .
Tom promised not to smoke .
He likes reading books .
I can say whatever I wish .
What more do you want ?
She needs someone to talk to .
I &apos;ll tell Tom right now .
A dog was running .
We can do it right now .
Can we get help for Tom ?
Maybe we should talk .
Where &apos;s the park ?
They can &apos;t fire you .
Tom wanted to save the world .
Tom is having the same problems we are .
She can &apos;t swim .
Can you do me a favor ?
We miss Tom .
How can this be possible ?
Why didn &apos;t you come by bus ?
He can &apos;t do it .
Nothing is missing .
Give me a drink .
I was advised to do that .
You could never do that .
There &apos;s a problem I have to talk to you about .
I &apos;ll take care of this .
My brother has been sick since yesterday .
This house is famous .
I didn &apos;t know Tom at that time .
You look worried , too .
I can &apos;t pay for the car .
That wasn &apos;t very nice .
She has a cat and two dogs .
It &apos;s not even on the map .
Tom came to Boston to look for a job .
Maybe Tom shouldn &apos;t be here .
Tom and Mary must really like each other .
Tom has things to do .
I have wine .
He is getting better day by day .
She has been waiting for him thirty minutes .
I decided not to try anymore .
I liked it a lot .
Can you tell me when Tom got his driver &apos;s license ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want my help .
Tom closed the door when he left the room .
Can this wait until tomorrow ?
Tom has come to see you .
Where is this money coming from ?
You don &apos;t need to wait for Tom .
I can &apos;t tell you any more about it .
I &apos;m not saying Tom is right .
It won &apos;t take very long .
How is Tom going to do that ?
I do wish we could finish today .
I need a dictionary .
Why is he doing this ?
Tom said that he &apos;d come .
I plan to go to Boston next month .
Is anyone else going ?
How &apos;s your brother ?
What more could you want ?
I need more .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else we have to do ?
We &apos;re still young .
Who found him ?
Tom might be sick .
I &apos;ll work on that .
Tom isn &apos;t alone .
We &apos;re supposed to be together .
We &apos;ll have to do that , too .
That was really difficult .
Where &apos;s the train station ?
I have something I have to tell Tom .
This is a beautiful house .
Tom wrote a song for Mary .
Tom never arrived .
This is his car .
I &apos;ve got to see you .
He thinks he knows best .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything today .
I &apos;m about ready .
You &apos;re completely right .
I think you should visit him .
Tom is married to a teacher .
We could both go .
I went to Boston on Monday .
I know you &apos;ll love it .
Tom was home .
What school did you go to ?
Would you like ice ?
I &apos;ll be with you in a few minutes .
Tom has been here for quite a long time .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to the movies as often as he &apos;d like to .
The weather &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom is going to cook .
Tom is probably in Australia .
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised .
I already told Tom .
Tom was convinced .
Tom wants to speak .
Go look for it .
I &apos;ll walk .
I want to die .
I had no idea anything was wrong .
I want to do it .
Tom has almost finished doing that .
I need to know everything there is to know about Tom .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything in six days .
In Japan , it &apos;s three in the morning now .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like money .
Tom is able to say &quot; I can only speak French &quot; in thirty languages .
You didn &apos;t need to do that .
Yesterday , he told me the truth .
This price is too high .
What doesn &apos;t Tom know ?
Don &apos;t you know ?
What on earth did Tom mean ?
You should be in a hospital .
I enjoyed swimming .
I have good news for you .
Tom wants to go .
Mary is much more beautiful than Alice .
I know it &apos;s impossible .
Do you think Tom saw me ?
My wife &apos;s going to kill me .
I can &apos;t get Tom to help me .
No one lives in this building .
As is often the case with him , he was late again .
I know that Tom works very hard .
Tom is in love with you .
You must not eat anything for a few days .
Don &apos;t play in this room .
There was no one in the room .
You &apos;re in my seat .
I know both of the girls .
That &apos;s not true at all .
When are you coming home again ?
I usually drink a lot of milk .
Tom walked across the room .
You must do as you are told .
I don &apos;t love you .
We are out of danger .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary got married .
I wonder if Tom still likes Mary .
I study French , too .
Tom got into the car with Mary .
We &apos;re parents .
Would you like to go to Boston with me next summer ?
That &apos;s old news .
He &apos;s like a brother to me .
Which do you like better , tea or coffee ?
That &apos;s not quite right .
We have to make sure we get there on time .
I want to get as far away from here as I can .
Would you like for me to do that for you ?
I &apos;ll go there .
How are you going to do that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
Who saw you ?
Tom is different .
I think this is the best part .
I &apos;m done with you .
You had better go to bed now .
He made me a new suit .
Is it possible ?
That sounds like fun .
I don &apos;t want to fight with you .
Tom opened the door for me .
Are they tall ?
Can I borrow your car ?
I &apos;ll make Tom do it .
If you &apos;re not quiet , I &apos;m going to ask you to leave .
Tom seems to think this is a good computer .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom &apos;s car was stolen .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
Tom and I usually speak French to each other .
I haven &apos;t heard from anyone .
Can you tell me what is happening ?
Where did you find these ?
I won &apos;t be quiet .
I &apos;m not happy with this .
No one will believe him .
Tom isn &apos;t quite finished yet .
She pretended not to hear me .
Why aren &apos;t they here ?
He looks good for his age .
Tom finished off the soup .
We &apos;re going to have a good day .
You should know that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
He made up his mind to be a doctor .
I see a girl standing under that tree .
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
Tom raised his hands .
That &apos;s not Tom .
Is this Tom &apos;s room ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think you should do that .
I know how difficult it is for you to believe me .
I &apos;m worth more than this .
I &apos;ve never been abroad .
I think your letter is under that book .
I &apos;m up here .
My birthday was last week .
Tom said this kind of thing happens all the time .
He asked me if I knew his father .
Tom thought that Mary was busy .
Why did you leave Tom alone ?
I wasn &apos;t sure if I was going to make it .
Did it actually happen ?
This message doesn &apos;t make sense .
Tom is sitting at his desk .
Tom drinks beer every day .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that .
Tom bought himself a dog .
Do you know whether Tom can speak French ?
We &apos;d better go back a little .
I &apos;m sorry about this .
I think about it sometimes .
She cannot play the piano .
Tom asked Mary questions .
Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
He spoke too quickly for the students .
I got off the train .
Don &apos;t call me anymore .
I want Tom to see this .
You &apos;re good , aren &apos;t you ?
Do you want to sit down for a few minutes ?
Tom may be home .
I went not once , but twice .
I &apos;ll never ask Tom to help me again .
I &apos;m still the same person I used to be .
Try hard .
Who &apos;s your dad ?
May I have your name ?
The problem here isn &apos;t me .
I &apos;ll never learn .
I only wish Tom had tried .
Tom wanted a bicycle .
This could take hours .
Tom and Mary are good friends .
I &apos;m not Canadian .
We &apos;ve only been married for three years .
I wonder where he has gone .
I &apos;d like to be like Tom .
I want the same dictionary as you have .
This is how the accident happened .
I think Tom is pretty angry .
I play the guitar .
Who did Tom plan on going to Australia with ?
What difference does this make ?
I don &apos;t care where Tom works .
Are you really sick ?
Who would do this ?
A solution must be found .
The man had something under his coat .
His house was small and old .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do so .
They &apos;re students .
We were in danger of losing our lives .
I wonder if Tom found something .
I might have to go to Australia next year .
I don &apos;t know what to do with it .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak good French .
I &apos;m looking for someone .
Tom seemed to be worried about Mary .
That can &apos;t be Tom .
We &apos;re not hungry .
I can &apos;t wait for you .
I really don &apos;t have much time .
This car is quite safe .
Tom says he has a plan .
You &apos;re so sweet .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough time .
I don &apos;t have anything to eat .
I &apos;m working hard .
Tom can &apos;t remember where .
How old is he ?
It was impossible to find an answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is going to do .
Make sure Tom doesn &apos;t see you .
Tom and I used to play tennis together .
Tom wants one .
You won &apos;t believe what Tom told me !
I &apos;ve read your book . It was very interesting .
The fish he caught yesterday is still alive .
Tom told me that he doesn &apos;t have a problem with that .
It &apos;s the size of a small car .
Why did you come home so late ?
I wonder why Tom wants to buy that house .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
He doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
Tom and Mary are still there .
We lost the game .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to thank me .
Tom is your enemy .
The telephone is now out of order .
I think you &apos;re pretty .
I would never kiss Tom .
I studied very hard .
I know most people here don &apos;t like doing that .
You &apos;re making me hungry .
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve .
Everyone in her class likes her .
You don &apos;t know how to speak French very well , do you ?
Tom isn &apos;t in .
The water is clean .
I want you here tomorrow by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
You are what you eat .
I can carry that .
Tom and Mary agreed .
I care what other people think of me .
He likes to go to the beach now and then .
I can barely sleep at all anymore .
You don &apos;t need to wait .
Tom is cold .
Tom finished his beer .
A lot has happened while you &apos;ve been gone .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ve never seen her .
I don &apos;t like French .
My father is out .
I &apos;m not going to explain it to you again .
I &apos;m too tired to do anything .
Your book is here .
I usually eat alone .
Tom didn &apos;t become famous until late in his life .
Tom believes whatever I say .
If anyone comes to see me , tell him that I am out .
Tom is quite young .
Tom said he &apos;d help Mary .
I know what Tom needs to do .
I don &apos;t need to do that if I don &apos;t want to .
Where is today &apos;s paper ?
The key has to be here somewhere .
He can swim like a fish .
I have no idea how I got here .
Yesterday , I ate an apple .
Tom wants to be like his father .
It &apos;s not easy to understand his ideas .
I want to ask a favor of you .
Tom ran to his car .
You only live once .
I found it there .
You don &apos;t know Tom , do you ?
Tom got there long after we did .
I have to stay in bed all day .
You won &apos;t believe what I found .
You won &apos;t give that to Tom , will you ?
I don &apos;t know what time it is .
Tom has promised to change things .
I don &apos;t want to go to the hospital .
I can &apos;t do this .
You learn quickly .
Did I keep you waiting long ?
I had him carry my bag .
Tom , I know you &apos;re in there .
I didn &apos;t have to open the letter . I knew exactly what it said .
I already spoke to someone in Tom &apos;s office .
I wish you had not told him about the plan .
Let it go , Tom .
She plays tennis very well .
Tom just wanted Mary to help him a little more with the children .
Tom likes to eat while he &apos;s watching TV .
If you want to say something , go ahead and say it .
Tom had a plan .
It doesn &apos;t look good , does it ?
We don &apos;t have a garden .
I spoke to my parents .
It &apos;s on me .
I still have about three minutes .
Your students don &apos;t like me .
That &apos;s your seat .
Tom has only a week to decide .
You look like a completely different person .
I &apos;m getting better at speaking French .
Tom gave us a present .
Tom showed me a picture of his family .
We are not alone .
I &apos;m OK with it .
Tom is married to Mary .
I bought it .
The decision has already been made .
You can call me Tom .
What &apos;s it to you ?
What fun !
Don &apos;t blame the mistake on her .
I ran out of the house .
Tom seems to be eating all the time .
Do you want me to make coffee ?
I have been studying French four years now .
I know everyone here by name .
May I call you tomorrow ?
How is it ?
Tom knows where to find me if he needs me .
Are you happy with that ?
It &apos;s getting hot .
In their case , it was love at first sight .
I bought a good camera .
I &apos;m not very good at cooking .
She quit the company .
I never heard him sing .
I think you know that .
I want to learn that song .
You &apos;re better off without them .
We all looked out the window .
The boy sat on a chair .
I may go swimming today .
Tom told Mary he had a lot of money .
Can you stay for dinner ?
I don &apos;t know anyone here , except Tom .
I &apos;m going to tell you something about Tom that you might not want to hear .
I went out with my friends .
My uncle lives near the school .
He &apos;s done this before .
Everything is OK .
Not everything can be bought with money .
A fish can swim .
Tom just doesn &apos;t listen .
I &apos;m in school .
I miss it .
I wouldn &apos;t mind doing that .
The light went on .
I have some food .
I think that &apos;s where Tom is now .
You were up all night , weren &apos;t you ?
He is working on a new novel .
You need to stop .
Who else was there ?
You are rich .
You are welcome to the use of our house while we are away on vacation .
Why did he do such a thing ?
I &apos;ve always known it .
My home is your home .
Someone &apos;s coming .
She doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Don &apos;t blame Tom for what Mary did .
Where do you think you are ?
Tom suggested we leave immediately .
No one knew the answer .
You &apos;re in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
There is no water left in the bottle .
What is it that we have to do ?
I love you like a son .
Tom has his father &apos;s eyes .
How long ago was it ?
Tom looked around to make sure they were alone .
We try our best .
Tom can fix anything .
I &apos;m thinking of going to Europe .
He arrived in time .
Does it get any better than this ?
What is all this ?
No one can stop Tom .
We need some money .
Could you lend me your bike ?
What does your son do ?
Tom said he thought that he should learn how to do that .
I hope you like what I &apos;ve just given you .
I don &apos;t like your boss .
I can &apos;t believe Tom is gone .
Our restaurant is the best .
What does it look like ?
She called the students into the room .
I won &apos;t let you speak to me that way .
I &apos;d love to go .
I don &apos;t like to be surprised .
I just want to do my job .
I don &apos;t like Tom and I never will .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary was .
You should know that .
I will speak with you tomorrow .
You know what I like .
He was lying on the bed .
How do you know what I &apos;m thinking ?
It just was not my day yesterday .
He isn &apos;t alone anymore .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
Tom is the one doing that .
You need to go to bed again .
I love driving .
Look at your hands .
Do you know why Tom isn &apos;t here ?
He gave me back the money .
He likes money .
Tom listened for a moment , but couldn &apos;t hear anything .
Tom knows Mary pretty well .
Why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
I &apos;m only going to show you once .
Tom and Mary always speak to each other in French .
He &apos;ll become a father soon .
She wants to buy a car , but she can &apos;t afford to .
Tom is going to study French next year .
Tom knows about this , doesn &apos;t he ?
What train did you come on ?
Would you mind waiting a few minutes ?
He is very careful .
I don &apos;t know how long the party will last .
Do you want to study with me ?
I am playing a game with my sister .
Can Tom come , too ?
I met him while I was staying in Paris .
What year is it ?
You were lucky .
She went to that store .
I didn &apos;t see you at Tom &apos;s party last night .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
It just doesn &apos;t sound right .
Tom helped me .
Let &apos;s leave when you are ready .
The clock is wrong .
That would &apos;ve been simple .
I almost had enough money to buy everything I needed .
It &apos;s more fun than studying .
Tom didn &apos;t take Mary seriously .
We study French .
I only have three dollars on me .
I was just angry .
I think about you all the time .
Tom is still in a bad mood .
I would buy him a beer .
Tom didn &apos;t give me what I asked him for .
Tom opened the door for the dog .
It &apos;s up to me .
I don &apos;t actually live in Boston .
Don &apos;t you want to be here ?
That &apos;s a tall order .
I would like to learn how to dance .
Will you study French next year ?
How could anyone not like music ?
I really thought Tom was happy .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom until he gets back .
Tom likes tea .
I think I &apos;ll do that .
Tom was one of my first students .
I believe we can get that done .
Tom thinks Mary is rich .
He is also very famous in Japan .
Tom wants to get married .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a girlfriend .
You really should quit smoking .
I would like to speak with Tom .
It wasn &apos;t expensive .
How fast can you run ?
What are you up to these days ?
Tom seemed afraid .
Thanks for talking to me .
Everything is going very badly .
Tom was sitting on the table .
Tom and only Tom knows the whole truth .
It &apos;s one of those .
That &apos;s my job .
Don &apos;t you want to go ?
She is afraid of cats .
I can &apos;t convince Tom .
He was too old to swim .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
He knows that you know .
I wish I &apos;d eaten more .
How do you like your new job ?
Tom will do it .
That &apos;s pretty sad .
I go to the country every summer .
I used to do that as a kid .
It sounds simple .
Tom came along soon after .
I &apos;m going away for a month .
Tom had a son .
She is still a girl .
I &apos;m proud to have him as a friend .
I can &apos;t stop asking myself that same question .
I &apos;m coming back home by bus .
That &apos;s the building where my father works .
I want to be there with Tom .
We don &apos;t know .
I told Tom that I wouldn &apos;t win .
We &apos;re not going in there .
Can you tell me the way to the bank ?
I said I &apos;d look after Tom .
I &apos;ll take my car .
Tom is there , too .
I never wanted to do this .
Tom may be here .
Tom doesn &apos;t look good .
How long do you plan to stay in Boston ?
Tom was born on a Monday .
You &apos;re not poor .
Where are her other pictures ?
This is the most fun I &apos;ve had in a long time .
No one &apos;s going to find Tom .
I &apos;ll be right there , Tom .
I &apos;m seeing them tonight .
I don &apos;t think Tom tried hard enough .
Leave my stuff alone .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting married .
I &apos;m going to school .
Is Tom around ?
I &apos;ve got no money left .
She &apos;ll probably come .
You aren &apos;t a Canadian , are you ?
I didn &apos;t tell anybody about it .
You do understand me , don &apos;t you ?
I got hit by a ball .
Do you think it &apos;s difficult to speak French ?
This one &apos;s for you , Tom .
I &apos;m often here .
He did as I told him .
Wait , why are you here ?
Tom seemed shy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary can swim or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t know which way to go .
I look forward to my birthday .
She is in bed with a cold .
I hope Tom comes .
Tom had dinner with Mary .
You look very beautiful today .
Tom had no hat on .
What if Tom was right ?
We &apos;ve found something .
What am I here for ?
Tom and Mary have gone to Australia .
Tom loves studying music .
Tom made this for me .
I &apos;m hungry , too .
I love you and I will always love you .
I am very happy .
Tom asked Mary not to drive so fast .
Did you go straight home after school yesterday ?
Tom and I are scared .
I can &apos;t understand what happened .
Are those your pictures ?
Take your coat .
If I &apos;d only listened to my parents !
Do you two want to be alone ?
Are you sure that man is a doctor ?
He loves her . She loves him , too .
He came late , as is often the case with him .
Tom isn &apos;t my father .
I &apos;m glad to see you , Tom .
She isn &apos;t poor .
Let &apos;s get this over with as fast as we can .
This is very important .
This is just what I wanted .
Today I &apos;m working from home .
Tom said Mary was very drunk .
Tom is doing everything he can to help .
He seems to have been sick last week .
He &apos;ll win for sure .
It is better to live rich , than to die rich .
Tom began crying .
Tom eats rice almost every day .
I took her home .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind what people say about Mary .
I speak French , too .
You &apos;ll be very happy here .
I &apos;d like to know if that &apos;s true .
She found him a seat .
Tom listened to my opinion .
Whose plan was that ?
I &apos;m going to do my best .
How much money do you have on you ?
I feel it now .
I was asked to wait here .
All of my children were born in Boston .
I thought you might like to know who &apos;s coming to our party .
She looks very sick .
Tom has been gone for a few days .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s even possible .
You know too much .
Look in there .
He has been sick in bed all week .
Tom is probably a bit older than Mary .
I nearly got killed .
Why is Tom always doing that ?
Tom died in the accident .
You can &apos;t help me .
That &apos;s what you think .
I didn &apos;t know you were Canadian .
I think it &apos;s very good .
Don &apos;t lose hope .
Boston is a big city .
I don &apos;t know what Tom has to do .
It &apos;s been five years since I last saw you .
Tom isn &apos;t my boyfriend anymore .
We &apos;re special .
He wants to kiss her .
I am going to write a letter .
I don &apos;t know how else to say it .
Mary bought a present for her friend &apos;s daughter .
Would you like me to ask Tom to do that ?
Tom wants you to eat .
I want to take Tom home .
There &apos;s no food left .
We still have a lot of time .
Tom and Mary both walked .
That doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom has already done a lot for us .
I need some help with my work .
They cannot stop it .
There was a girl in Tom &apos;s car .
We need a map .
My mother is against smoking .
Tom isn &apos;t as fat as Mary .
Just go back to bed .
They want you dead .
No one has died yet .
I don &apos;t think Tom is in Boston .
Are they still in bed ?
I didn &apos;t want that .
We must not speak in the library .
Do you want to tell me what happened ?
Can I get your help with something ?
Tom looks just like John .
Tom was very angry with Mary .
That may not happen .
They tried everything .
I never wanted you to go .
I couldn &apos;t go to the concert , because my mother was sick .
I didn &apos;t understand the question .
We love having Tom back .
Tom said that he &apos;d do just about anything for Mary .
He got angry with me .
Tom hardly ever talks .
What do you do in Japan ?
Did you see Tom leave ?
Do you have any idea why Tom gave it to you ?
I just love that .
This is a good car .
Tom said that I could sleep on the sofa .
It &apos;s good to be here .
Let &apos;s go to my place .
How long have we been friends ?
He is being kind today .
I want to work at a hospital .
I &apos;m the person that did that .
Is my answer correct ?
Tom knows the way .
I have absolutely nothing to do today .
Tom and Mary went to church together .
Tom won &apos;t be missed .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have kept Mary waiting so long .
He &apos;s very angry with you .
Tom knows where Mary is .
How are we going to do it ?
The decision &apos;s already been made .
Be yourself .
At first , I was disappointed .
I already told Tom everything .
Tom won &apos;t help .
He &apos;s two years older than me .
Tom and I were both busy at that time .
Mary is my mother .
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make another mistake .
I would &apos;ve gone to the movies if I &apos;d had the time .
Tom isn &apos;t around .
What could you have done ?
I want to see you .
Leave that there .
Do you really think I can help you ?
Do you really think I wouldn &apos;t help you ?
May I ask a few questions ?
Something &apos;s missing .
We do what we want .
Tom loved his family very much .
You don &apos;t have a chance .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth it .
I feel lost without you .
Do you know anybody who speaks five languages ?
I was asleep from one to four this afternoon .
Tom will stay with us .
We have been good friends for ten years .
He seemed to like that .
I would like to say something .
Tom seems to have left the country .
No one believed me .
Tom can &apos;t come with us .
I &apos;m trying to work .
We never swim .
I wish I had known how to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t admit his mistake .
Why did you decide to not go to Boston with Tom ?
So you really don &apos;t know ?
I have finished my work .
Don &apos;t go , Tom .
I went there yesterday .
Tom refused to help Mary do her homework .
Tom is not my son .
She can &apos;t have known about it .
Maybe I can help .
We plan to leave as soon as possible .
&quot; Would you like to go to the movies ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;d love to , but I &apos;m busy . &quot;
I would like to marry somebody like her .
Tom certainly knows a lot about Boston .
Tom used to be pretty good at tennis .
Tom wasn &apos;t like that at first .
I &apos;ll stay home and study .
Did you telephone him ?
Will you be at home tonight ?
That wasn &apos;t what I wanted to hear .
What &apos;s inside ?
Is this a dream ?
It makes no difference to me whether you come or not .
This has happened before .
Let go of my arm .
I want to keep my car there .
I love your son .
Why don &apos;t we take it with us ?
I know Tom is still alive .
I saw you working in the garden .
Tom makes fun of everybody .
I don &apos;t think Tom will mind .
You &apos;ve missed the boat .
This is bad for business .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with us .
It &apos;s my job .
Why did you try to do that ?
Nothing &apos;s going to happen .
I want us to be friends again .
What time did the meeting end ?
Tom killed himself .
Don &apos;t be too hard on yourself .
It &apos;s here .
It almost sounds like you miss Tom .
You still owe me one .
I caught a fish !
She dressed herself quickly .
I &apos;ll be back on Monday .
I should not have done that . It was wrong .
I was the only man .
They &apos;ve gone .
Tom is several years older than Mary .
He is a good student .
Tom &apos;s parents often fight .
Our baby isn &apos;t speaking yet .
Tom couldn &apos;t look at Mary .
Tom did everything for Mary .
Tom and Mary had been married for three years by then .
She &apos;s about the same age as my older sister .
Children begin school when they are six years old .
Some of them are my friends .
I &apos;m never late for school .
Do it right away .
Tom is the one with the problem .
You have to come .
My brother likes music .
Don &apos;t go there .
Thank you for this .
I knew your father .
Tom wasn &apos;t sure if he was going to make it .
There &apos;s got to be an answer .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason .
I remember .
Tom lost his new watch .
I know what I said .
Tom is with us .
Tom told me what you did .
Do you like my clothes ?
Tom and Mary are young .
I can &apos;t remember who I gave it to .
We plan to stay a week .
Do Tom and Mary know ?
I wonder what Tom is reading now .
Can you call him ?
I want a new kitchen .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you do that .
They have been busy .
How often do you go shopping ?
The train has not arrived yet .
He &apos;s not my boyfriend .
You &apos;ve broken your arm .
We have a contract .
Look after the cat while I &apos;m away .
This isn &apos;t about me or Tom .
I can do more .
Let &apos;s send for the doctor .
Tom got that bicycle from Mary .
I don &apos;t hate you anymore .
I &apos;m very worried about your health .
We &apos;re not surprised .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to come to the party .
He has not realized his mistakes yet .
Tom should &apos;ve done that weeks ago .
Tom and I have to leave .
Nobody saw Tom do it .
We &apos;ve got to make a choice .
Tom was confused and didn &apos;t know what to say .
Why &apos;s Tom studying French ?
Do I really have to give a speech ?
You should have kept your mouth shut .
He &apos;s at church right now .
Tom and Mary have kissed each other more than once .
I &apos;m already bored .
I seldom hear from him .
I thought you said your name was Tom .
I closed my door .
He is young .
You &apos;ll have to go .
Nobody wants you to do this .
I no longer want to live in Boston .
I know Tom will change .
Come back in a month .
Was Tom the one who did this ?
He is not an American , but he loves America .
I &apos;m too poor to buy a new suit .
I &apos;ll give you a book .
How many times an hour does Tom do that ?
I could not understand anything he said .
When did you start learning French ?
Tom became famous very quickly .
Tom said that Mary wasn &apos;t looking for a job .
I love money .
Tom is already here .
He has changed a lot , and he is no longer what he used to be .
It &apos;s very difficult to understand Tom .
I &apos;ll do any kind of work .
Tom hardly speaks any French .
Can Tom help us ?
I get asked that question a lot .
I wonder if Tom knows where my umbrella is .
It &apos;s been over a year since the accident .
I worry about him .
Have you ever been there ?
Tom said that Mary had a cold .
I love going to the movies .
Tom ran out of the house .
Did Tom say where Mary might be ?
I know that look .
You didn &apos;t hear this from me .
I said I &apos;d do it .
He hates his life .
I only hope you &apos;re right .
She can &apos;t drive a car .
Do you want to drink tea or coffee ?
Why are you going to Tom &apos;s again ?
I have to use the dictionary .
I have no idea what this is .
Do you really not know ?
We lost it .
I can &apos;t live without TV .
Tom is dying to see you .
Tom had money , a lot of it .
I don &apos;t remember .
Do you like it or not ?
I can sleep anywhere .
What do you want me to do , Tom ?
How did you find Tom ?
You won .
He &apos;s a man we can trust .
How old are your kids ?
Tom will go to Boston next week .
My name isn &apos;t on the list .
I bought many books .
I didn &apos;t get the point of his speech .
Tom didn &apos;t have to do that .
Tom tried to kiss me .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you kiss Mary ? &quot; &quot; She wouldn &apos;t let me . &quot;
We can &apos;t just give up .
You don &apos;t know what it is to be poor .
We knew you &apos;d come .
Tom knew everything .
Do you know where Tom is going ?
Tom is a lot better at doing that than Mary is .
I &apos;d like to ask one or two questions myself .
There &apos;s no coffee .
Tom said he needed our help .
It &apos;s far too small .
Tom was looking quite happy .
I like to be around people .
After dinner , I take a walk on the beach .
&quot; Look , &quot; she said .
What are you going to do for Tom ?
Tom is going to be very hurt .
She asked several question of us .
I don &apos;t want to wait that long .
Did you have a good time this afternoon ?
I told Tom the truth .
I got to know him when I was a student .
Tom and Mary seem to love each other .
She kissed him .
He laughed at my joke .
I want to apologize for last night .
I &apos;ll take it home with me .
I often went to the movies with my father .
She doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
I never had a car .
That isn &apos;t my problem .
We &apos;re out of time .
I drink coffee .
Did Tom really say he thought I was smart ?
Go away .
Tom &apos;ll be ready .
He is studying in the library now .
Our money is gone .
Tom was right about that .
Tom got into his car , closed the door and drove away .
They may come .
I can &apos;t do it that fast .
I &apos;ll fix it .
I can &apos;t help .
He speaks French .
Tom got Mary to drive John and Alice home .
Call me tomorrow afternoon .
Tom was really crazy .
Tom is popular at school .
I can &apos;t leave .
I &apos;m taking tomorrow afternoon off .
I &apos;d be happy to sing for you .
There are no fish in this lake .
I need to remember to buy some milk .
Your Japanese is good .
He said that you had better go .
It &apos;s always been that way .
The question is what does it mean .
I was a little early .
I have things to do tomorrow .
I still can &apos;t believe it happened .
He &apos;s about to leave .
This is my question .
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
Tom will work hard .
I don &apos;t know where Tom put his suitcase .
I know what Tom would say .
Tom wants to ask you why you weren &apos;t at the meeting last week .
I hate it when there are a lot of people .
The people knew he did not like them .
I met him just now .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
There &apos;s nothing more you can do for me .
I don &apos;t know her telephone number .
Tom looked drunk .
Is Tom ill ?
He lives alone .
We were all a little tired .
Everything he says is correct .
We want to get out of here as soon as we can .
I really liked talking to Tom .
Are you friends with Tom ?
I don &apos;t like this song .
This car is his .
Can you tell me where Tom is ?
I found it later .
She was too tired to speak .
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore .
Give Tom his keys .
She &apos;s about the same age as I am .
We know how they are .
Have you lost your mind ?
Tom will study French next year .
I &apos;m tired of waiting .
Whose books are these ?
I should &apos;ve known better .
I love you very much .
I have to study for the exam .
I must go there .
He is still here .
We shouldn &apos;t have left Tom alone .
These shoes are too small for me .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s older brother .
He &apos;ll be back home soon .
Where would you like to go next ?
Tom can &apos;t work .
I think that &apos;s the reason Tom doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Do I have to write a letter ?
I don &apos;t want to die like this .
You have no right to go there .
I wonder whether Tom knows how to speak French or not .
Tom and Mary have just left .
Get Tom out of here .
She promised me that she &apos;d come .
How &apos;s it going with you and Tom ?
To make a long story short , we married .
Why is she so popular ?
Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow .
How long &apos;s that going to take ?
Call me later .
Tom never saw her again .
What do you want to hear from me ?
I want to live in Australia .
Tom can &apos;t help me anymore .
I can &apos;t eat all this .
I want to sleep a little more .
You eat too much .
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher .
A new dress was bought for her .
Every bus is full .
You saw what Tom did , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom is still looking out the window .
He doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
I bought this for my girlfriend .
Look out there .
Have you seen that movie ?
We had a really fun time .
Tom was serious .
That &apos;s very sweet of you .
Were they lying ?
I love that movie .
That sounds like a good idea .
If it were not for water , we could not live .
I &apos;m going and that &apos;s that .
What time do you want me to be here ?
I just did what Tom asked me to do .
You are to do it at once .
I don &apos;t have time to do all the things that need to be done .
Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
Everyone &apos;s asleep .
Why do you take that medicine ?
It &apos;s up to you to do it .
I don &apos;t know if we can help Tom this time .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t have time .
I can &apos;t swim as well as Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom knows that Mary likes him .
Tom should thank Mary .
Tom pretended to be my friend .
I want to talk with my lawyer .
How deep ?
I knew you &apos;d come .
I &apos;m looking for my camera .
I never understood why Tom liked Mary so much .
Tom took a picture .
What area of China do you like the best ?
Where is Tom anyway ?
What was that ?
I &apos;ve seen that face somewhere before .
I &apos;ll be free tonight .
The price of meat dropped .
I wanted to be with you .
She doesn &apos;t have many friends .
Tom ought to win .
I have a big problem .
Do we know when they &apos;ll make their decision ?
Is this your dictionary ?
I &apos;ve been here almost three years now .
I don &apos;t want to become like those people .
We were here first .
I don &apos;t study as much as Tom does .
What &apos;s so special about that ?
Here we are .
Tom made Mary very happy .
Maybe your name really is Tom .
I am not hungry .
My children rarely go outside .
I love you more than anyone else .
I will be back soon .
You have such beautiful eyes .
We need to get out of here .
It is too long ago .
I can &apos;t afford a car .
You should go home .
Tom hit me twice .
There was music .
Did that accident really happen last year ?
Don &apos;t tell Tom I &apos;m coming .
I saw him in the park .
Are any of you coming with me ?
I can &apos;t see a way out of this .
Tom waited , but Mary never came back .
He speaks poor French .
Didn &apos;t I tell you not to close the door ?
You may stay here as long as you like .
Tom and I both work .
Tom can speak French much better than me .
I bike to work .
I don &apos;t put sugar in my coffee .
I &apos;ll go get Tom .
Come along with me .
You are late .
What does this have to do with me ?
This is the best book that I &apos;ve ever read .
We don &apos;t know how to use it .
Tom has gone to school .
I can &apos;t remember anyone &apos;s name .
I went to the doctor .
No one knows what happened .
It was a new experience for almost everyone .
I received your message yesterday .
What &apos;s that in your pocket ?
I don &apos;t have four brothers .
Tom walked alone .
I know your brother .
Tom played a song on the piano .
Did somebody hit you ?
Do you think I don &apos;t care ?
Can she come in time ?
Tom opened all three letters .
It changed my life .
They understand us .
I feel the same .
Can I go to bed now ?
What &apos;s the point ?
I am not like you .
I know what you did .
I want to use these .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live like this anymore .
Can we have a word with you ?
I &apos;d rather not answer that question .
Why does Tom do it ?
Can you help me find a job ?
Tom is good at golf .
I looked all over for Tom , but couldn &apos;t find him .
Tom thinks we don &apos;t want to go .
I know where Tom did that .
We lost .
He tried to open the window .
I &apos;ll be there Monday .
You &apos;re going to love Boston .
Tom and Mary were very happy together .
Please be quiet , everybody .
Tom &apos;s older than me .
Tom has decided to give Mary another chance .
Tom is rich , isn &apos;t he ?
You &apos;re so cute together .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that ?
Who &apos;s at the door ?
I want to see that again .
I remember Tom asking for my help .
You &apos;re used to that , aren &apos;t you ?
This is it .
I have to give this book to Tom .
There is always something to do .
I will do anything for you .
I think you &apos;ll like it .
I was just about to go home .
He is not wearing a hat .
Tom found Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
You know I have to go .
I will give it to you .
Tom was so busy .
I have to sleep .
Tom didn &apos;t have any money .
Where &apos;s Tom going to live ?
I &apos;ll miss you after you &apos;ve gone .
Do you have enough time ?
Tom had to leave his dog at home .
Tom has to come to Boston .
Tom died at his home in Boston .
I &apos;m not happy with it .
Tom wasn &apos;t rich .
I want a picture of that dog .
I didn &apos;t know who to give it to .
I have hardly any money left .
The airport is closed .
You are in my way .
I can &apos;t stay much longer .
I &apos;m not living with him anymore .
It &apos;s a new day .
Tom left without saying anything .
I missed the last bus .
What are they going to do ?
What would the world be without women ?
They &apos;re awake .
Tom opened a window .
He is older than you by eight years .
The story is good except that it is a little too long .
Is that what Tom said ?
I like these .
I know that it &apos;s difficult .
Tom eats more food than Mary does .
This doesn &apos;t happen every day .
I don &apos;t have the time to read this book .
He tried it over and over again .
The phone was out of order again .
How are things in Boston ?
It was almost too easy .
Where is Boston ?
Tom worked until late at night .
I &apos;m very happy to be back home .
Can &apos;t you go to Boston with Tom ?
You must have a driver &apos;s license before you can drive a car .
There &apos;s a lot of room in here .
I am disappointed that my friends are not here .
Do you play tennis ?
I understand how good Tom is .
Look how happy you made Tom .
Tom is going to be happy .
I like Tom &apos;s plan better than Mary &apos;s plan .
I thought Tom had changed .
I should learn some French .
I wish that wasn &apos;t the case .
He forgot my birthday .
I saw you crying .
You did that in school , didn &apos;t you ?
I was busy all day .
Please don &apos;t try this at home .
Tom is a student .
I realized I couldn &apos;t win .
How does that sound ?
Tom , can you hear me ?
Tom and Mary have a country house .
We &apos;re ready to go .
Tom ran out of time .
He did badly at school .
It &apos;s very new .
I don &apos;t want to go .
The trouble is that there is little water left .
How long have they been here ?
Tom ran outside .
I knew there would be something to eat .
You don &apos;t want to talk about it at all , do you ?
Tom &apos;s birthday is next Monday .
Have you been to London before ?
No one wants to talk about books anymore .
I do that almost every day .
The house was big .
Tom did a really nice job .
She likes to go to the beach .
Who taught you to write ?
What do you need ?
You &apos;re working hard .
You must believe me .
You need to learn not to ask so many questions .
He wants to go to America .
Tom wanted Mary to play a song for him on the piano .
I think I &apos;ve forgotten something .
Tom became afraid .
I would like some fish .
It &apos;ll be done by the time you get here .
I &apos;d like to see your father .
Do you know what this means for us ?
He had already gone .
Where does Tom want to do that ?
Tom still wants to go out with you .
Tom and Mary are on their way here now .
Maybe you didn &apos;t understand Tom .
She put the children to bed .
This is a present for you ?
You ought to wait for Tom .
I can &apos;t think of anything that might help .
Is your school far from here ?
He wrote to me yesterday .
Tom loved it in Boston .
Did you catch any fish in the river ?
When are you going to come home ?
I &apos;ve never told anybody this before .
When was the last time you caught a fish ?
Don &apos;t put sugar in my coffee .
That doesn &apos;t happen often .
Were you busy yesterday ?
I don &apos;t know anything about him at all .
Tom is doing that for Mary .
It &apos;s a beautiful job .
Leave everything .
This room doesn &apos;t get a lot of sun .
I don &apos;t know anybody in this town .
I &apos;m not sure who Tom &apos;s teacher is .
Who gave that to you ?
Tom met Mary outside .
Are you good at cooking ?
It doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s going to rain .
Have you tried it before ?
I guess I &apos;d better get back to work .
I noticed that he had stopped .
It &apos;s from your family .
You can &apos;t let anyone else know .
It &apos;s popular with women .
All these books are mine .
Just give me one more chance .
Tom said that he thought he &apos;d be able to do that today .
May I speak to Tom , please ?
I was almost right .
Is this new ?
I don &apos;t like that .
Do you know where he lives ?
I know you can do this .
I haven &apos;t eaten yet .
Tom knew what to do .
Do you like running ?
What are you going to be when you grow up ?
Tom is probably cold .
Tom is driving me mad .
Can &apos;t you buy a car ?
I can &apos;t read this .
You missed .
I don &apos;t know if he will visit us next Sunday .
I &apos;d rather walk than wait for a bus .
I looked all over for Tom .
She took a walk before breakfast .
I &apos;ve never been on my own before .
My watch keeps good time .
We &apos;re too late .
Tom isn &apos;t nice .
Can I eat this bread ?
I love doing that .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s in there .
I know all I need to know .
I want to be here for you .
How did it all come about ?
They wouldn &apos;t let anyone talk to me .
How many languages do you speak well ?
They caught Tom .
I thought you loved it .
Why are you coming to Boston ?
How do you do that , Tom ?
What &apos;re we doing in here ?
I already told Tom that .
I could hardly hear him .
The town has changed a lot since then .
He may have missed the train .
We &apos;ll go together .
I thought that you were my best friend .
Here &apos;s something I want you to give to Tom .
Tom will go to Boston next month .
I don &apos;t have anything to give you .
This apple is bad .
They &apos;re able to sing .
What do you think they &apos;ll do ?
I don &apos;t know where to wait for her .
Tom asked Mary to give a speech .
That &apos;ll do .
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
I just want to have fun .
She is busy at present and can &apos;t speak to you .
We don &apos;t live here .
Why did you come early ?
Why don &apos;t you want me to know ?
Tom fell asleep while reading the newspaper .
Tom is trying to learn French .
She was in America last month .
This works every time .
I &apos;ll ask Tom about it tomorrow .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re alone .
The movie wasn &apos;t as interesting as the book .
I wrote this song just for you guys .
Does Tom know how to drive ?
She went out of the room .
I can &apos;t help anyone .
Aren &apos;t you a Canadian ?
I know how I am .
I &apos;m sure I saw her two years ago .
Let me carry it .
The day isn &apos;t over yet .
I brought Tom some fruit .
Tom loves what he does .
Tom must care about you very much .
Give me your address and telephone number .
Tom is here with me .
Don &apos;t forget to write to us .
They didn &apos;t even know what they had found .
Tom knew the reason .
He has no friends to fall back on .
Where &apos;s my son ?
Both Tom and Mary want to study French .
This is how it happened .
Will you be in Boston next week ?
Are you through with the newspaper ?
Tom hates it when it &apos;s cold .
I bought a house .
They saw me .
She can &apos;t have done such a thing .
She hit him again and again .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying .
That &apos;s what love is .
How &apos;s your cold ?
I must know the truth .
Tom doesn &apos;t look much older than Mary .
What do you want me to do for you ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
He looked her right in the eye .
We hardly see you anymore .
You must really be proud of yourself .
Who &apos;s Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Has Tom eaten anything ?
Who found my bag ?
You &apos;d better wait until the police come .
No , that &apos;s not true .
Did Tom ask about us ?
I think I &apos;m going to go now .
Tom isn &apos;t able to do it .
We want to talk to you about that .
Tom might talk .
My father got home late last night .
When was the last time you saw her ?
Tell Tom why .
What would you like to drink today ?
I &apos;m certain I saw Tom .
The problem was very difficult .
Tom was sound asleep .
They want to get married .
Tom showed an interest in the book .
Tom heard Mary singing in the kitchen .
Do you want to talk to me or not ?
I hate working .
I just want you to know that I &apos;m here for you .
I can &apos;t even look at it .
I have to go to the doctor today .
She is in the kitchen because she &apos;s making dinner .
This car is older than I am .
I have three times as many books as him .
Tom says he met my father .
I have no future .
This is no joke .
We &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary had already done that .
We cannot do the work in a day .
Tom doesn &apos;t think before he speaks .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to war .
You &apos;ve been at it for hours .
I think he takes after his father .
Tom said he &apos;d never been to Boston .
I don &apos;t know you .
It would be better for you to stay away from such a man .
I think we both know why I &apos;m here .
How can we learn the truth ?
I don &apos;t work there anymore .
I &apos;m busy at the moment .
You &apos;re no longer children .
I only read part of the report .
Have you changed anything ?
Tom does what he says he &apos;ll do .
I believe in always telling the truth .
I love my cat .
Tom was my teacher .
How far is it from here to the next village ?
I want to wait another week .
He hadn &apos;t eaten anything the whole day and was hungry .
Tom , I &apos;m here .
Tom put himself and his children at risk .
This book will do .
Tom knew Mary didn &apos;t know French .
It is next to impossible .
I hate losing .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re together now .
If I don &apos;t do that , then someone else will have to do it .
Have you ever heard him sing ?
I hope you &apos;re right .
You cannot smoke in this room .
We were at school together .
I didn &apos;t even know you had a girlfriend .
I love you more than anything .
Tom brought his lunch today .
Tom was alone there .
Do you have anything to say ?
I &apos;ll be doing that with Tom .
Your car is fast , but mine is even faster .
I &apos;m used to cooking for myself .
My mother died when I was a kid .
Where can I wash my hands ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t do anything to help .
He can &apos;t swim .
Tom seems to have won .
What &apos;re we looking for ?
How does Tom do this ?
I don &apos;t like you either .
I see you &apos;re all awake .
It cannot be true .
I can &apos;t do it now .
Here &apos;s some water .
I don &apos;t want to do this here .
We &apos;re not in danger .
We want to go home .
I need to put the children to bed .
Mary is mine .
There is a car in front of the building .
I took off my shirt .
I only speak French .
I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Those are mine .
That &apos;s not a cat . That &apos;s a dog .
Tom looked me in the eye .
Tom refused to eat what his mother put on the table .
Do you know the reason why she is so angry ?
Here &apos;s the key to my apartment .
I &apos;m not married to Tom anymore .
I &apos;ll ring you back .
Tom should be back before 2 : 30 .
Go home quickly .
Tom will go .
Tom does want this , doesn &apos;t he ?
Aren &apos;t you also from Boston ?
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;ll be back .
Tom wanted to return to Boston .
Tom likes animals more than people .
I can &apos;t understand what he is trying to say .
This road goes to the park .
That &apos;s what I need to do .
She can &apos;t do that .
Look at the large building over there .
This is the very book that I wanted to read .
They say that he is seriously ill .
My father was busy .
Tom left for a second .
I like your hat .
Tom asked me to talk with you .
You &apos;re not happy , are you ?
He took many pictures in London .
They sell everything here .
How about you come with me ?
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
We &apos;re sure that it was an accident .
Tom didn &apos;t stop talking .
Tom sent me that .
I was surprised that Tom spoke French so well .
We don &apos;t want you with us .
They say that he knows the secret .
He didn &apos;t show up at the party last night .
Tom looked very happy .
We &apos;ve known Tom for years .
This dog is big .
They &apos;re angry .
You &apos;re very smart .
We know all that .
I asked him to be here by six .
Here is the map .
Tom wears a different tie every day .
We live close to the station .
Tom should &apos;ve known .
Give me another chance .
Tom had the same problem .
Tom and Mary want to talk to me .
It &apos;s really hot in here .
We should help Tom .
I must fix it .
I don &apos;t like his jokes .
Tom might &apos;ve won .
Tom started talking to himself .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do without you .
Who wrote to Tom ?
It &apos;s time for the kids to go to bed .
She has a bottle of milk every morning .
I took my hat off .
I want to learn how to swim .
Tom loved school .
He shut the door .
Are you satisfied with your job ?
Are you still here ?
Don &apos;t tell Tom anything .
These are my parents .
She looks nice and healthy .
The cake is still warm .
Why are you back from lunch so soon ?
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
Do you want to come with me ?
We &apos;re not going to make it , are we ?
I believe Tom is looking for you .
Germany is famous for its beer .
What will happen will happen .
I wish I &apos;d known .
May I show you something ?
You &apos;d like it .
You know what I mean .
We &apos;re upset .
Tom looked well .
How &apos;s Tom going to do it ?
She always gets up early .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom .
Tom speaks French worse than English .
Do you enjoy it ?
Why are you not doing it ?
Can they see me ?
I play baseball .
We want to talk with Tom .
Tom is not coming .
Tom got hurt in the game last week .
They &apos;re nervous .
That &apos;s what you said the last time .
I knew I should &apos;ve married you .
She lives in an apartment alone .
Tom looks like he &apos;s happy .
I loved Tom like a brother .
I &apos;m in trouble .
Tom has no idea when Mary will arrive .
Tom has three dogs .
I &apos;ll show you around town .
I drank some wine .
Tom didn &apos;t take the news very well .
We can &apos;t let Tom die .
How &apos;s everyone doing today ?
Tom sat down on the bench .
That &apos;s not possible anymore .
You may go now .
They say it &apos;s up to you .
I &apos;ll stay at home tomorrow .
He &apos;s a bit shy .
We &apos;re nearly finished .
I think I &apos;d like to do that .
I didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that .
I don &apos;t know how to stop it .
He &apos;s been sick in bed for four days .
I want you to do that .
I &apos;m glad we agree .
Tom didn &apos;t want to hear anything I had to say .
I know where we are .
I have just received a letter from a friend saying that she is coming to see me next week .
I almost kissed Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t really have to do that today .
Your dog is here .
Go to work , Tom .
Do you know where I can find it ?
Who wants to know ?
It &apos;s been over a week since I last saw Tom .
Tom still isn &apos;t totally convinced .
Tom can &apos;t have gone to bed yet .
Why do you have that ?
Is this seat empty ?
He will do anything to make money .
Tom isn &apos;t as fast as me .
I said we &apos;ll get one .
I don &apos;t care what Tom says . I &apos;m not going to go .
Tom is so much older than I am .
Tom asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
This is not funny anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t study enough .
She has no one to talk to .
How was Tom &apos;s party ?
What &apos;s going on here ?
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t happy .
Someone should talk to him and tell him what &apos;s what .
I don &apos;t think that Tom will help us .
We don &apos;t do this often enough .
You should call the police .
He missed the last train .
I would ask him if I were you .
Tom has left us .
Why are you looking at me like that ?
Tom entered the room after you left .
I can do it myself .
They &apos;re very old friends .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me much about it .
What do you want Tom to do ?
I need a good lawyer .
How do you know what you should do ?
Is there anything else you want to know ?
I &apos;d like to have an answer .
Tom asked Mary why she needed to do that today .
Tom can &apos;t swim very well .
They aren &apos;t afraid of death .
The train will arrive at ten o &apos;clock .
I do my best .
I &apos;m on the way home .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Do it now .
Do you think Tom is afraid ?
I have just finished my work .
Tom knows he can always count on Mary .
I have a lot of problems at the moment .
If I were you , I &apos;d talk to Tom .
It wasn &apos;t very fun .
You should &apos;ve told me yesterday .
He killed himself at the age of thirty .
How long have you guys been standing there ?
I &apos;m not asking about that .
They will die .
That &apos;ll be seven dollars , please .
I don &apos;t have a computer at home .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
She loves Tom , not me .
Tom is going to school in Australia .
You were happy .
I stayed at home .
No one saw you , I hope .
It is hardly possible for him not to make any mistake .
He has made me what I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I have a cat .
Do you want to do this now ?
It was his fault .
Tom put some milk in his coffee .
They lost their dog .
I had no work yesterday .
I &apos;ll write you a letter .
Will we be safe here ?
Tom barely studied for the exam .
She advised him to read more books .
I have to wait .
It was easy for him to solve the problem .
Do you know where ?
I &apos;m happy to see you .
I didn &apos;t go to school .
Tom gave Mary his telephone number .
Tom told me he hasn &apos;t done that yet .
You &apos;re going to love this book .
I hope nobody got hurt .
You aren &apos;t going to tell my parents , are you ?
The cat doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
We &apos;ll talk about that soon .
Can you show it to me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to go .
You &apos;ll feel better .
Tom and Mary just bought a new car .
It has been raining since Sunday .
How is the weather there ?
Are you angry with Tom ?
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen .
Don &apos;t let the dog in .
I just told Tom the truth .
Tom has made it happen .
Tom isn &apos;t as strong as I am .
He &apos;s writing a book now .
All we need is water .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that anymore .
I want to drink tea .
My advice is to go home .
We need to ask you a few questions , Tom .
She did the work alone .
Tom asked Mary why she didn &apos;t want to go to Australia with John .
I know what you did in Boston .
Tom is history .
You wouldn &apos;t have to say anything .
Tom didn &apos;t do that .
I can teach you how to swim .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for over three months .
What &apos;s Tom doing up there ?
Please write down everything I say .
I couldn &apos;t care less .
We need to talk to you about something .
How was I supposed to know ?
We &apos;re just good friends .
Let &apos;s ask some questions .
I want to go to Germany .
Please turn off the light .
Why is everyone looking at me ?
Tom isn &apos;t invited .
Tom was late for the meeting this afternoon .
I hope we find Tom .
Maybe Tom can help you .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is doing that .
I hope you know what this is .
Tom and I are good friends .
I &apos;m still waiting for you .
Tom has a nice voice .
How did Tom know where Mary was going to be ?
I &apos;d be happy to help you .
I didn &apos;t want to cook .
When is a good time for you ?
I &apos;ll go to the hospital .
You shouldn &apos;t have said that .
He didn &apos;t agree to my proposal .
It isn &apos;t hard to do .
Tom made his mother cry .
It won &apos;t happen again .
Tom wanted to help his friends .
Do you feel like going to a concert ?
Would you like anything else ?
Can &apos;t I stay here with you ?
Tom called me from Australia .
I don &apos;t know where my keys are .
The whole country is talking about it .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary wants to go .
What do we do about Tom ?
Can I have the key now , please ?
Tom never lost hope .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
I don &apos;t want to open the window .
Did my father really die ?
Give me three more apples .
What did she buy at that store ?
Tom is looking for work .
I did what Tom needed me to do .
It is long way to the town .
What are they doing ?
You &apos;re a woman .
You need to wear a tie there .
He bought his daughter a new dress .
Tom said he saw Mary sitting in the park by herself .
I &apos;d also like to have a try .
Tom looked at his watch again .
I can hardly swim .
That doesn &apos;t help me .
What do you think of it , Tom ?
Tom says he &apos;s doing that .
I &apos;ll let you know as soon as I get there .
I had some fun .
We found one .
I knew you &apos;d like it .
What &apos;s your plan for tomorrow ?
The dog is dead .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that Mary is in love with him .
Please open the window .
I have a sister and a brother .
There &apos;s no doubt .
I wonder if Tom can come .
I want to ask Tom what he &apos;ll do .
Can you give that to Tom ?
How does Tom do it ?
Tom sat waiting .
I want to dance .
Your father seems very nice .
How do I get to the station from here ?
You need to have breakfast .
This isn &apos;t my car .
She turned down my proposal .
Go back to bed .
Does he have many books ?
Is it going to rain ?
My mom always says that she will visit me soon .
Tom is leaving now .
Hey , you can &apos;t leave now .
It is dark outside .
My father loves my mother .
It doesn &apos;t look good at all .
I &apos;ll get it .
I don &apos;t live with Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary has done .
We all trust you .
Give me a chance to make you proud of me .
They can &apos;t see me .
I &apos;m hungry . How about you ?
He is alone .
My grandfather goes for a walk every day .
I want to sing a song .
His concert was very good .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know French .
I &apos;ll take your suitcase to your room .
We will come together .
We &apos;re asking you not to do that .
I do not feel like doing it .
Stop playing with that thing .
Can we come ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to do that .
Look at that dog .
We have no school today .
I &apos;m not doing this for the money .
He went to Boston by car .
Tom was here just a moment ago .
Tom refused to leave the house .
I won &apos;t help you .
What &apos;re your plans for tomorrow ?
You are very beautiful .
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done ?
I had fun with it .
Tom has trouble standing still .
May I play the piano ?
We have to get him to the hospital before it &apos;s too late .
It was a good try .
I like tennis .
It looks like you &apos;re thinking about something else .
I don &apos;t know everybody in this school .
It &apos;s for us .
Do you know where Boston is ?
It &apos;s worth a shot .
Tom and Mary both look a little confused .
Your thirty minutes are almost up .
You have a lot of books .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there alone .
This is the last time I &apos;ll ask you to do anything for me .
What did you miss ?
Please explain this sentence to me .
Tom is taking a few days off .
Tom sounds angry .
I think I &apos;ll buy a new car .
When did you two decide to get married ?
There is still much more to be done .
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom anything .
I &apos;d be crazy to expect such a thing .
I &apos;ve come for Tom .
Let &apos;s not speak French today .
Tom is likely to win .
Tom really loved Mary .
I &apos;m from Australia .
Let Tom in .
She didn &apos;t know what to do .
You let me down .
Is there anyone who can answer ?
Tom didn &apos;t know anything about Mary .
She can hardly speak .
I know what Tom likes .
This is really cute .
What are you going to say ?
I thought so .
Where did you see them ?
Are you going to tell Tom ?
I still want to hear Tom &apos;s opinion .
You may as well tell me the truth .
They aren &apos;t alone .
You &apos;re three years younger than Tom .
Tom hasn &apos;t got much money with him .
I should &apos;ve gone home .
Is there anything for me ?
Everyone &apos;s sick .
I &apos;ve made my decision .
I need a new bicycle .
What can I do for you this evening ?
I &apos;d like to be as rich as Tom .
I decided to be a doctor .
Do you like it here ?
I didn &apos;t do it for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Is that it ?
Tom put on some music .
Did Tom say where we should meet him ?
I &apos;ve got nothing else to do .
Tom has been sick for the last three days .
Tom took off for home .
Tom plays piano .
You work hard .
I &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible .
We looked for it here and there .
She taught him everything she knew .
Everyone except Tom and Mary left .
I &apos;m sad .
Tom didn &apos;t tell you about what happened to Mary , did he ?
He &apos;s helping me .
I don &apos;t know whether to tell Tom or not .
Tom is my sister &apos;s boy .
I &apos;d like to study in Boston .
What did they do ?
I think I &apos;ll be going .
Is your mom at home ?
You should have listened to me .
Tom told Mary he wasn &apos;t busy .
I have to deal with this alone .
Tom became a doctor .
Where were they ?
Do you think this is crazy ?
Tom runs faster than me .
I found this watch at the station .
I thought Tom had quit smoking .
Would you get me a glass of water ?
He must have studied English hard .
I know who it was .
We didn &apos;t expect it to take this long .
Why don &apos;t you come , too ?
It is really quite a good story .
There &apos;s not much to say .
I think I &apos;ve waited long enough .
We went dancing .
She &apos;s busy now and can &apos;t talk with you .
She &apos;s helping me .
You have to come with me .
What do you want with Tom ?
Did Tom ask about me ?
How come you didn &apos;t come ?
I don &apos;t know if she will come .
I think we &apos;ve got a new problem .
Who told you that I was sick ?
Tom saw Mary sitting alone at her desk .
I &apos;m surprised Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
Do you know how the accident happened ?
Tom and Mary are afraid of John .
You have what they want .
Tom is going to do that .
Would you like to come over to my house ?
I hope that won &apos;t happen again .
Nobody had anything else to say .
They can &apos;t stop you .
They live near the school .
Tom should talk to me .
I don &apos;t know what Tom does .
I &apos;ve been looking for this for a long time .
They want to come .
You should eat more .
I have the day off .
Can you explain that to me ?
Tom is in big trouble .
Tom felt a little guilty .
When did the accident take place ?
Let go of my hair .
He wants a watch just like yours .
We &apos;re dying .
Do you want to learn to play guitar ?
I will lend you money just this once .
Tom was right after all .
Leave now .
Do you know the way ?
Come again tomorrow .
Do I have to answer all of the questions ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to believe .
You &apos;re in my way .
I &apos;m nervous , too .
He took to drinking after his wife left him .
I think it works .
I don &apos;t like Tom .
Keep this window closed .
Tom said that he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
We made a decision .
I was very happy to hear the news .
Tom had no money with him at that time .
Tom is playing with his cat .
Would you care for another glass of beer ?
I have a lot to do today .
Where do you want this ?
I asked Tom about his new book .
I can &apos;t afford a new car .
Tom isn &apos;t too happy .
Is this going to take long ?
You don &apos;t have to tell it to me if you don &apos;t want to .
We &apos;d better wait until tomorrow .
We don &apos;t have much snow here even in the winter .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to drink anything else .
Tom plays the piano better than I do .
He does nothing but read books all day long .
Can you show me ?
Have you ever read a book written about Japan ?
That is not much of a problem .
You should smoke less .
I heard that Tom does that .
I went to the hospital .
I &apos;d never been to Boston before .
Tom doesn &apos;t feel like cooking .
Let Tom have his turn .
I can &apos;t believe I actually said that .
Tom started washing his car .
I can &apos;t get anybody to tell me anything .
Take these .
I don &apos;t have to apologize for what I said .
Tom is trying .
You &apos;re sitting in my chair .
Why don &apos;t I do that ?
I am not well at all .
Who fell ?
What &apos;s Tom looking for ?
I will ask him about it tomorrow .
I can &apos;t remember .
I did everything I could to save Tom .
I &apos;ll go and ask Tom .
That bridge isn &apos;t long .
You &apos;re going to miss me .
Tom is always busy .
Did Tom get my message ?
He is the very man that we &apos;ve been looking for .
I wonder if this is love .
Give me your keys .
Do you like that song ?
I never asked Tom .
I want a beer .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very busy .
What is Tom eating ?
I feel very lonely these days .
I want to know what &apos;s going on out here .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t be late .
Tom has to tell the truth .
I &apos;ve never done it this way before .
How many times have you done this ?
Tom wanted to know what happened .
I don &apos;t think I can do this without you .
I want you to take me to Tom .
I went to the hospital yesterday .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
I don &apos;t get the joke .
We need you .
Could you do it ?
I wish I were young .
We &apos;ll all go there together .
Are you happy in your house ?
I don &apos;t want you to see this .
Aren &apos;t you afraid ?
I &apos;m going to take good care of you .
This is a picture .
Tom was born on a ship .
I understand French .
Tom might never speak to me again .
Did Tom say why he was here ?
Tom asked for help .
That is how it happened .
Tom wasn &apos;t very good .
Tom plans to come to Australia .
Tom said Mary was willing to help us do that .
He is far from happy .
Put some salt on your meat .
What do you have for me ?
He does not like tennis .
I wish that she would stop smoking .
Tom called me at home .
I want to speak to a lawyer .
I found it easy to answer the question .
It &apos;s driving me crazy .
Tom likes snow .
They are my friends .
You &apos;re a good mom .
I &apos;ll take a look at it .
The day is getting longer and longer .
Have you seen him before ?
Has something changed ?
Do you want to dance with me ?
Tom is also very famous in Australia .
How often do you see her ?
Go when you want .
What are we going to do with that ?
I will go at 10 .
I want to know your name .
I met my friends yesterday .
Don &apos;t get nervous .
His story must be true .
I &apos;m going there alone .
I like my bike .
Tom runs a company in Boston .
There are a few problems .
I used to like walking in the rain when I was a child .
I don &apos;t know what to do or what to say .
We aren &apos;t going to do that .
I don &apos;t want to meet Tom .
He made a joke about it .
Tom said that he thought that Mary needed to do that before she left .
What about having fish for dinner ?
What would you like ?
It &apos;s a little difficult for me .
Mary is pretty .
We shouldn &apos;t lose courage .
Have you ever been married ?
I &apos;ve got a little problem .
I know you &apos;re right .
It &apos;s a fine day .
Tom knew he had to help Mary .
Do exactly as I say .
There was nothing we could have done .
Do you really want to have children ?
We still need to buy some bread .
Tom doesn &apos;t know about Mary &apos;s death yet .
I &apos;m here because I need your help .
Could that happen again this year ?
I &apos;m not able to speak so fast .
I &apos;ll never see Tom ever again .
He doesn &apos;t work here now , but he used to work here .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home yesterday .
I &apos;d like to be friends .
Do you know anyone who &apos;s gone to Boston ?
He was standing .
I think we should call the police .
I &apos;m looking for a gift for my wife .
The train doesn &apos;t stop at that station .
Tom will be dead in a few days .
We have been studying French for three years .
You must do it this way .
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
Let &apos;s forget about this .
I &apos;ve been to Australia three times .
My work is done .
Try it .
You don &apos;t have to go with Tom .
I can &apos;t play the piano .
Tom stole something from my house .
That &apos;s true as well .
The three of them all just looked at Tom .
Aren &apos;t you going to study French ?
He may come today .
I need the keys .
Tom said he didn &apos;t find it funny .
I &apos;ve just finished lunch .
My mother is sick in bed .
You don &apos;t know them .
We can &apos;t change what has happened .
Who invited you guys ?
I &apos;m hungry because I haven &apos;t had lunch .
Nobody speaks to me .
This suit is too good for me .
I love what I do .
It is up to you .
I &apos;ve enjoyed working with you .
We &apos;ve already done our work .
Tom &apos;s parents and Mary &apos;s parents are friends .
She is in love with him .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same decision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me earlier ?
I hardly ever see Tom anymore .
Tom wasn &apos;t stupid .
Why are you so quiet ?
We &apos;ve been here for a couple of minutes .
We &apos;re giving up .
We &apos;ve been here almost three hours .
We &apos;ll be fine .
When will you return ?
I wrote more today than yesterday .
I &apos;m already rich .
I &apos;m taking a walk in a park .
He knows how to make his wife happy .
Do you remember what Tom said ?
Tom walked off .
What do you say to my plan ?
Don &apos;t say it like that .
Tom is about a head taller than me .
They &apos;ll come .
I &apos;m here for you .
There &apos;s no way I &apos;m leaving you here alone with Tom .
What we need now is a break .
I heard you talking on the phone .
Tom is only a couple of years older than Mary .
We &apos;re nearly out of time .
I &apos;ve got to call Tom .
Look what I made for you .
Have you ever kissed another girl ?
I &apos;ll take the bus .
I could write a book .
I almost forgot to do my homework .
I don &apos;t care what people think .
Would you please take my picture ?
Is it OK if I tell Tom about it ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
Tom refused to pay .
He does nothing but play all day .
Tom is still just as poor as he used to be .
Who broke this window ?
Tom looks hurt .
Tom is outside playing with his friends .
No one wanted to be seen with Tom .
Tom must be a good teacher . All of his students seem to like him .
Both of Tom &apos;s parents went to college .
We do what we can .
He saw a lot of animals on the road .
This bike is used by my brother .
I think that girl &apos;s name is Mary .
Tom told me I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary .
We must never do this again .
The answer is actually quite simple .
All I have is a book .
Would you tell me the time , please ?
Tom has been sick for a long time .
He made it for his sister .
We will leave in an hour .
Tom has some money in the bank .
She got sick this weekend .
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus .
Is it too small ?
The river is dangerous .
His opinion doesn &apos;t count .
Is that a new car ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
I remember everything .
He is no longer a child .
We &apos;re a bit late .
What &apos;s going on ?
They bought a new car .
Tom didn &apos;t want to marry Mary .
I want to go to Boston with you .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem ?
Let &apos;s go to a movie .
Tom lives and works in Boston .
Why did you write this book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like eating fish .
You said it yourself .
I don &apos;t think Tom is Canadian .
How did you spend your vacation ?
Tom was the last person to finish eating .
I &apos;m going to be ready in five minutes .
The teacher gave us homework .
Do what you have to do .
Tom wasn &apos;t ready , but Mary was .
I won &apos;t come .
I will make a man of you .
We should &apos;ve done this much sooner .
Are you Japanese ?
You will be told where to sit .
Tom says that he &apos;ll be at the meeting tomorrow .
I cannot stand this noise .
Where did I leave my glasses ?
Tom will come for sure .
I gave him what little money I had with me .
I enjoyed swimming in the river .
Tom wants what Mary has .
Don &apos;t look into my room .
I know that he was busy .
We &apos;ve got to be ready in thirty minutes .
I didn &apos;t realize what time it was .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom everything Mary asked me to tell him .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without your help .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink anymore .
Tom thought Mary was bored .
Thank you for trying .
His daughter , as well as his son , was famous .
Tom doesn &apos;t look old .
Here are the keys .
Why not let Tom try ?
I think of her day and night .
Are you still married ?
I know whether or not he is an enemy .
Someone has left a bag on the bench .
Is he a friend of yours ?
I don &apos;t know when , but it &apos;s likely to happen before next Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks to his kids .
Stop smoking .
Everything is going very well .
Tom was lucky to find his keys .
You look sick .
Let me pick up the check .
I &apos;ll get one .
There &apos;s no need to worry .
How can you not like this ?
Tom helped Mary put her coat on .
I think Tom likes it .
I received her letter last week .
He left without saying anything .
I was at the hospital with Tom when he died .
My mother made me what I am today .
We don &apos;t let people like you in here .
What &apos;s your friend &apos;s name ?
I didn &apos;t hear him coming .
We don &apos;t have to worry about Tom .
I never heard from Tom after that .
Do you have school today ?
They are still children .
We &apos;ve been asked to leave .
&quot; Thanks . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re welcome . &quot;
Where are Tom and his family living now ?
Please stop crying .
Tom has twice as many books as I do .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve spoken French .
I do want it .
Are you in trouble with the law ?
What happened here ?
You &apos;ve got a big problem .
I arrived ahead of the others .
I don &apos;t know how , but I did it .
This is where Tom worked .
I couldn &apos;t help but laugh .
Tom &apos;s parents went to college .
I know I did that .
The book is white .
I &apos;m interested .
Tom didn &apos;t actually do that .
It &apos;s seven o &apos;clock .
They will be safe with her .
This room is large enough .
The only language that Tom can speak is French .
Is there a train station near here ?
The girl is lonely .
We used to be in school together .
She started ten minutes ago .
You won &apos;t get there on time .
Tom is eating cake now .
Why don &apos;t you tell me ?
The two friends got on well together .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t wait any longer .
I have an explanation .
I don &apos;t have your courage .
They aren &apos;t here .
Tom lives at home with his mom .
The little girl doesn &apos;t like to wear shoes .
How can you tell Tom is a policeman ?
I should have studied more .
Tom and I are convinced .
You can trust them .
Australia is a beautiful country .
Do you like your car ?
Tom has written a book .
Give me your phone .
Tom will probably never walk again .
Tom is coming with me to Boston .
It &apos;s this book .
You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
They told me I had to help you .
You don &apos;t know what I know .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows about this yet .
Tom is very lonely .
Was her story true ?
I was the only one who knew about it .
Tom , the pizza &apos;s here .
Have you ever seen snow ?
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon .
The cat is sleeping on the chair .
She is not home , but at school .
He went home yesterday .
He left the room without saying a word .
This is just too much .
We have to tell Tom .
What other choice did I have ?
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia ?
You don &apos;t have a key , do you ?
This door will not open .
Do you have Tom &apos;s address ?
Tom has nothing to do .
A sentence doesn &apos;t have to be long to be beautiful .
He bought a book and gave it to his father .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
He does everything very quickly .
Perhaps Tom left .
I think about Tom all the time .
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me .
How does Tom know ?
It &apos;s not going to be easy to finish this job on time .
The whole class laughed at his joke .
They love coffee .
Tom lives near us .
Have you eaten dinner yet ?
I &apos;ll do what I have to do .
You ought not to have done that .
The new movie was a big hit .
Tom may come .
I know the man sitting over there .
He can &apos;t answer their questions .
It may be all right .
What have we got here ?
What does this mean ?
Who is the boss of this company ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go .
I hope you &apos;ll like it .
Have you already read this book ?
I &apos;ve got time .
It was almost too good to be true .
That &apos;s not the only problem .
How much is this sofa ?
Would you like to have a cup of tea ?
Why aren &apos;t you there ?
No one knows that I like you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time .
Did you buy Tom a dog ?
Mary doesn &apos;t have a husband .
I like living in Boston .
To tell the truth , I &apos;ve already seen that movie .
I agree with you absolutely .
I want to know if you &apos;ll be free tomorrow .
Those are too big .
I know the girl playing tennis .
She is his friend .
Would you answer some questions for me ?
She looked around .
I hate this job .
I will stay .
What does Tom want ?
My parents don &apos;t know .
Tom isn &apos;t outside .
I think I know what to do .
Tom has told me I need to do that .
I think it &apos;s time for you to tell me the truth .
That &apos;s a beautiful suit .
All the meat was bad .
I made him do so .
I need more room .
I go to the restaurant every 2 days .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary did all her homework by herself .
My father thinks that he &apos;s always right .
What do you want to get Tom for Christmas ?
Some of my money has been stolen .
I wish it was that easy .
Tom is wearing glasses .
Are you sure Tom did that ?
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with Tom .
Do you want my help or not ?
I &apos;d like to know where Tom lives .
They &apos;re all guilty .
Don &apos;t go near the dog .
I have good news .
I really should be getting home .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
Nothing like this has ever happened before .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I want .
I take back what I said .
You two probably want to be alone .
Where are we getting the money ?
I don &apos;t eat much .
You must not smoke .
Tom and Mary looked at each other .
I said I &apos;d wait for Tom .
There &apos;s nothing in this room .
Why do you put up with that ?
I know you don &apos;t have time to help us .
I &apos;m always very nervous .
What are your plans for today ?
Tom stopped playing the piano as soon as we walked into the room .
The radio doesn &apos;t work .
I can speak English a little .
I didn &apos;t mean to do it .
He can swim .
I heard a little girl crying .
When does the train leave for Boston ?
I go to church by car .
It worked .
When are you walking home ?
I went to Boston by train .
Tom is hiding under the table .
Did Tom say how long Mary would be in Australia ?
Tell us something we don &apos;t know .
What do you like about Tom ?
You will never be alone .
Tom talks about Boston a lot .
He &apos;ll be here soon .
What &apos;ll you tell Tom ?
Do you want to hear it ?
Tom should come .
He is asleep .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary are getting married .
I almost forgot that it was his birthday .
Tom is just nervous , that &apos;s all .
These pictures are really very beautiful .
You used to tell me everything .
This is not a good idea .
Tom has been asking questions about you .
Do you really want to go to Boston with me ?
Do you know my husband ?
What &apos;s your asking price ?
Tom is not here .
Tom wants to study in Australia .
It &apos;s no use waiting for him to come .
Tom said that he loves me and wants to marry me .
We &apos;d both really like to go to your party .
I have my passport .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night .
I don &apos;t like beer .
If they find us , we &apos;re dead .
Who says I &apos;m afraid of Tom ?
Tom wasn &apos;t here when I came in .
I wish that I could help you .
I &apos;m still single .
What does Tom have to do with this matter ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell us the truth .
I wonder why Tom didn &apos;t call me .
I know you want to see Tom .
I &apos;ll let everybody know .
We need help .
I will miss you all .
I don &apos;t know how , but you did it .
I thought you loved me .
Children often swim in the lake .
Who is Tom talking to ?
I don &apos;t want to be rich . I just don &apos;t want to be poor .
You can &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
You &apos;re going to like it .
I don &apos;t have any money .
I &apos;m coming for Tom .
He &apos;s wearing a hat .
I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s a bit cold .
I think he &apos;s interested in you .
Tom is drinking water .
I &apos;ll sleep in my room .
They &apos;re brothers .
Why do we have to decide this today ?
I no longer believe it .
There are many bad people in the world .
Tom just got home from work .
Tom is going to be back here soon .
We aren &apos;t alone .
Tom seems to know the way .
The letter was written by Tom .
I couldn &apos;t help crying .
There &apos;s a lot of traffic .
Is there anything else I need to know ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom doing this ?
I &apos;m so sorry about that .
I &apos;ll take your word on that .
Can &apos;t we go with Tom ?
Tom should &apos;ve done it the way you told him to do it .
Why weren &apos;t you at school yesterday ?
She &apos;s not a child .
Tom &apos;ll understand .
There were only six people at the party .
Tom took off his glasses and closed his eyes .
I had nothing to do with it .
Do you not want me here ?
We &apos;ll never get there in time .
She didn &apos;t have much money .
Let me look into it .
I think that Tom should do that .
Could I have one more coffee , please ?
I can &apos;t explain how it is .
It &apos;s very healthy .
She is five years old .
I don &apos;t have any plans for tonight .
He is not so tall .
Please take me to this address .
Tom went crazy .
I was told Tom would be here .
Tom knows Mary and John are no longer together .
He went to the shop .
I arrived here yesterday .
Tom wrote this book .
Will you do me a favor and feed the dog ?
I &apos;ll never tell anyone .
Tom wanted you to think he &apos;d left town .
Mary isn &apos;t really my type .
It &apos;s nice to see Tom so happy .
I thought Tom had gotten over Mary .
I wondered whether or not Tom wanted to go to Boston with Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough time to eat lunch .
He came about two .
My father is tall .
Who ate ?
The medicine didn &apos;t do me any good .
I will watch it .
I got a taxi in front of the station .
I don &apos;t want to ever see you again .
They &apos;re playing our song .
It &apos;s quite clear that Tom doesn &apos;t want to be here .
You never say anything .
I wasn &apos;t making fun of you .
I was told that you might be able to help me .
What does Tom think he &apos;s doing ?
It is no use trying to solve this problem .
Tom refused to leave without Mary .
Come on , Tom . Don &apos;t be shy .
Is Tom in pain ?
Tom was important to me .
I &apos;m going to go with Tom .
How did you do this ?
I thought this was important .
I told Tom .
Tom often drives too fast .
Tom seemed sure of himself .
She is walking .
Tom closed the door .
She spoke up for him .
I wonder if Tom has a girlfriend .
Tom loves it .
Tom had a gun .
Does Tom have any brothers ?
What is your name ?
We should probably ask Tom .
We have to do that .
I wish I could sing as well as you do .
Is there anything you want to tell us ?
I didn &apos;t eat dinner last night .
I can &apos;t go with you .
I want to make her happy .
Can you read French ?
They found each other .
There &apos;s nothing that you can do about it .
He knows a lot about animals .
I just can &apos;t understand you sometimes .
Don &apos;t give it to anyone .
They may go .
It &apos;s what Tom wanted .
She couldn &apos;t convince him to buy her a new car .
Here , take this .
Is Tom still here ?
Are you sure you want to do it ?
Tom isn &apos;t home yet .
Have you actually ever tried it ?
The cat slept on the table .
I love my life .
Tom loves playing the piano .
Tom can &apos;t even ride a bicycle .
How many people are there ?
Tom must have seen something .
Can I see it before I go ?
Who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe it .
Where does he come from ?
Tom closed his mouth .
I &apos;ll be reading a book .
Don &apos;t you want to see Tom again ?
No one believes him .
Tom put his clothes back on .
I &apos;ll miss you so much .
I do not love him anymore .
Tom can &apos;t believe Mary &apos;s over thirty .
I &apos;ve told you all of this once already .
Where &apos;s my lawyer ?
They had had that problem before .
I don &apos;t want you doing that .
I &apos;m not sure whether I really want that .
Tom has a room at the hotel near the river .
Who invited you to the party ?
I didn &apos;t want to do this in the first place .
Mary is the only girl Tom is really interested in .
Did I say too much ?
I feel happy .
I don &apos;t want to see anybody today .
He doesn &apos;t stand a chance .
Tom looks busy today .
How far is it from New York to London ?
Tom and Mary looked at each other through the window .
I like this answer .
Please don &apos;t open this window .
I knew what had happened .
Now you &apos;ve given yourself away .
I &apos;ll be back in five minutes .
You &apos;d better be careful .
Can I help you ?
I have a large family .
Tom is going to stop by today .
I will go on foot .
Are you sure we &apos;ve never met before ?
I can &apos;t let you give me your last ten dollars .
I &apos;m still busy .
That we are not able to do .
I think we &apos;d better be going .
Where were you ? We &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
Can you please tell me what time the train leaves ?
I have a few friends in the United States .
Is there anything you want to say , Tom ?
I &apos;m really happy for you .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want me to do that ?
I don &apos;t know what to feed my dog .
We can still be friends .
It wasn &apos;t until this morning that Tom told me that .
Tom could see Mary from where he stood .
Are these your own books ?
When will you be free ?
I take it you haven &apos;t heard about what happened .
He was late for school yesterday .
What movie do you intend to watch next ?
How will you stop me ?
I want you to tell me everything you know about that .
He &apos;s ten years older than you .
Where are all the others ?
Tom asked me to give you something .
Did you say that I could never win ?
I can &apos;t understand why Tom hates me .
Tom was a bad student .
I knew Tom couldn &apos;t have done this by himself .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
She spoke as though nothing had happened .
That &apos;s your problem .
Why is he here ?
Maybe we should help Tom .
He &apos;s worried we &apos;ll lose the way .
Everybody who was anybody was there .
Tom didn &apos;t have much to say .
Can I talk to Tom , please ?
I already know what happened .
I &apos;m tired of losing .
You &apos;ve got to help us .
Do you have enough time to do that ?
I can &apos;t help you .
Tom died three weeks ago in Australia .
When I was your age , I had a job .
Tom went to the park by himself .
Has he arrived already ?
I don &apos;t do this for the money .
What are you doing up ?
You drive .
What &apos;s written in the book ?
You must be crazy .
Is Tom going to be there ?
It looks good to me .
Tom seems to have been rich .
Do you actually like this ?
I want to know where you heard that .
I feel sick every morning .
What about a glass of beer ?
I should not have said that .
Could I have a little more water ?
Even though I studied French for three years in school , I &apos;m not good at speaking it .
Can you take a break ?
This isn &apos;t my key .
I saw a plane .
What kind of job are you looking for ?
I have an idea .
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
I like listening to Tom .
He took me by the hand .
Mary can dance well .
We can &apos;t open this yet .
It must &apos;ve been very difficult for Tom .
If you don &apos;t want to stay , you don &apos;t have to .
I &apos;m really tired and want to go to bed early .
I can speak French better than Tom .
Tom can run as fast as Mary .
I taught him how to swim .
How does he do this ?
I feel much worse today than yesterday .
Have you ever been kissed ?
I can &apos;t answer that question .
What will you wear ?
Have you had dinner already ?
Tom has problems at school .
Who would buy it ?
I heard you singing .
Tom says he is rich .
The TV is broken .
My daughter is fast asleep .
We must hurry if we want to arrive at the station on time .
Tom isn &apos;t old enough to understand this .
Why don &apos;t we go and see a movie ?
There &apos;s not much happening here .
Do you know when they will arrive ?
Don &apos;t you want to stop Tom ?
My opinion really doesn &apos;t matter .
Let me know as soon as he comes .
Look at the picture .
Don &apos;t give in .
I &apos;d like to see what Tom has .
My brother is coming on Monday .
I &apos;ll stop .
Does Tom like you ?
Tom put on his glasses and began reading .
Tom won &apos;t be expecting us .
Tom won &apos;t wait .
Tom is better off than he was this time last year .
I don &apos;t go swimming as often as I used to .
Tom has been sick in bed for the last three weeks .
I like your hair .
Let &apos;s get together again tomorrow evening .
I like to read the news .
It &apos;s time for me to be on my way .
I had to do it before 2 : 30 .
She quickly opened the letter .
The problem was so difficult that I could not solve it .
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t home .
Tom said you &apos;d come .
It was very cold , but we went out .
Why do you want to take a taxi ?
No one knows what &apos;ll happen in the future .
Tom can &apos;t drive a car .
I don &apos;t remember anything else .
Why did she do that ?
I received a letter from my brother .
Tom has to do that , too .
Tom must do it now .
We &apos;ll miss you , Tom .
How do you think it &apos;ll go ?
I know those girls .
It sounds like you want to be alone .
Are you sure you really don &apos;t need anything ?
You can &apos;t drive now . You &apos;ve been drinking .
Christmas is just three weeks away .
Why do you have two cars ?
Tom is honest .
Tom , Mary and John are in the kitchen .
You should &apos;ve said so earlier .
I &apos;d like to know what you &apos;re doing .
We have to think about our children .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet , have they ?
Tom said that he &apos;d go to Boston .
I didn &apos;t think it &apos;d happen this quickly .
I don &apos;t want to go to sleep .
I need to explain a few things .
I want to do everything I &apos;m supposed to do .
I don &apos;t want to eat any more .
I &apos;d like to be more than just friends .
It sounds interesting .
I have to go shopping . I &apos;ll be back in an hour .
How do you like living on your own ?
The house has been sold .
Is it the truth ?
Tom won &apos;t leave you .
Can you speak French ?
I was told to wait for a while .
She drank a cup of coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t know how old Mary was .
Please answer this question for me .
What did you say ?
I sat by his side .
You don &apos;t even know me .
You can &apos;t help them .
Can I be there when you tell Tom ?
Tom won &apos;t leave if you don &apos;t want him to .
I had an accident .
What do you want to do tomorrow ?
She stayed here by herself .
I bought this watch at the store .
That &apos;s what you always say .
Why do I have to study French ?
I think Tom went to Boston by car .
We were worried sick .
Do you have a wife ?
Tom has a lot of work to do this week .
They don &apos;t make them like they used to .
We understand why .
I can &apos;t talk now . I &apos;m too busy .
Tom &apos;s wife had a baby girl yesterday .
It &apos;s not a joke .
I &apos;m no good for you .
Let &apos;s not wait for Tom any longer .
I &apos;m feeling pretty good .
We have a new problem .
Maybe you ought to let Tom do what he wants to do .
We watch TV every day .
Tom likes him .
May I ask what that means ?
Who &apos;s Tom looking for ?
Tom probably has a girlfriend already .
Tom was behind me .
Here she is !
I just gave Tom 30 dollars .
Let &apos;s get some pictures .
No one seems to listen to us anymore .
Tom knows about this already .
Tom asked Mary where he should put his suitcase .
Today is the best day of my life .
We &apos;d like to know about it .
What else do you know about Tom ?
Tom called Mary back the next day .
Mary told me that she didn &apos;t love her husband anymore .
Tom took the money off the table .
Tom doesn &apos;t care much for swimming .
I take it you like Tom .
I am not your enemy .
Who were you waiting for at the station ?
I &apos;m a lot taller than Tom is .
She opened the letter quickly .
He never takes me out for dinner .
Why didn &apos;t I think of that before ?
Tom probably thought I was angry .
It was hot in the room .
Where does your family live ?
I don &apos;t want you to go home .
What don &apos;t you want me to see ?
That &apos;s not what was supposed to happen .
You may as well give up .
Here , this one &apos;s yours .
What have you got to lose ?
Tom stuck up for me .
I need my glasses .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have said such a thing .
Tom should eat .
Where is Tom working now ?
Give me your phone number .
What did Tom know ?
This novel is so easy that even a child can read it .
Why don &apos;t you want to help the police ?
Which do you think is the best solution ?
It &apos;s not a watch .
What &apos;s up with you and Tom ?
I want a book to read .
You &apos;re doing great .
I wrote a letter to my teacher .
You will soon be convinced that I am right .
Don &apos;t leave here until you have done it .
Tom asked Mary about her life in Australia .
Tom &apos;ll be here soon .
Tom asked me a question .
Tell me the truth .
I have no idea what to expect .
Tom will leave soon .
You &apos;re home early .
Tom is going to be great .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have been here today .
When did Tom start studying French ?
Tom will wait .
I &apos;m not going to use it .
Why didn &apos;t you tell Tom this ?
Do you know them ?
It didn &apos;t hurt at all .
Would you lend me your bicycle ?
That happens all the time .
He takes a walk every morning .
My house is only five minutes &apos; walk from the station .
Did you enjoy your swim ?
That &apos;s yesterday &apos;s news .
We have been married for three years .
Do what you want to do .
I believe that &apos;ll happen .
You will need a key .
I think this is the way to do it .
Tom &apos;s work has gone from bad to worse .
How do you know all this ?
Tom has been injured three times .
I don &apos;t understand what the problem is .
Tom has decided to go to Boston .
I know your mother .
My idea is different from yours .
They &apos;re looking for Tom .
The hat on the desk is Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston , too ?
Tom can &apos;t stand it .
Can I talk to someone who speaks French ?
Tom now lives with his dad .
I don &apos;t want you to see my daughter anymore .
I work with her boyfriend .
His story is true .
There &apos;s something I need to talk with you about .
We found them .
Tom didn &apos;t say much .
Nobody knows where it is .
Do you know where Tom lives ?
I know what happened .
I love you just as you are .
Tom used to play guitar .
Tom gave Mary the money .
I &apos;m good at tennis .
We have had little snow this winter .
I only saw Tom once .
Tom thought it was a good idea to do this .
Does she have a boyfriend ?
Tom and Mary were too tired to fight .
I want Tom to read this .
Who was that woman I saw you with ?
It wasn &apos;t me . It was the cat .
He gave it to me .
He &apos;ll be here again .
Thanks for the pizza .
I learned this song from Tom .
What they say is true .
Tom is running short of money .
I have problems with my wife , too .
There &apos;s no other explanation .
Tom will explain .
Tom &apos;s watching .
This was all Tom &apos;s idea .
Tom , we have a problem .
Tom needs money .
Tom came here for the money .
We have to take the stairs .
There &apos;s nothing on TV that I want to watch .
Tom gave Mary a ride home yesterday .
An apple fell off the tree .
I &apos;ve never seen you laugh .
How is it made ?
Tom gave me this watch .
Let &apos;s get started .
Tom said he was tired and wanted to go home early .
They are our cars .
If you don &apos;t have anything to say , don &apos;t say anything .
He has a cat and two dogs .
I can teach you how to do this .
Tom is the one with the car , not me .
She didn &apos;t give me my money back .
Tom isn &apos;t the enemy .
How many does he want ?
I want nothing to do with it .
Tom is taller than me .
I saw her at the station .
You can tell the truth .
I &apos;m not guilty .
Tom and I were good friends .
You &apos;re sure taking your time .
Tom showed up at about 2 : 30 .
I always carry a knife .
It &apos;ll all be over soon .
Did you ever think you &apos;d see Tom doing something like that ?
She didn &apos;t go yesterday .
They can &apos;t see Tom .
I wonder whether or not the weather will hold .
You cannot read this novel without crying .
Tom looks very tired .
Tom and Mary are both my friends .
How often does Tom play tennis ?
That can &apos;t be Mary . She &apos;s in the hospital now .
She is much younger than Tom .
We &apos;re back .
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends .
What does Tom think about this ?
How are things with you and Tom ?
Tom laughed to himself .
He looked me in the eye .
Tell me how long that boy has been sitting there .
This place hasn &apos;t changed much .
I want to buy a shirt for my brother .
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody in the house .
You can dance , can &apos;t you ?
Isn &apos;t it a bit small ?
We now know that was a lie .
If you want to see Tom , you have to hurry .
What do we have to do ?
Is my French really that bad ?
I don &apos;t like this place .
Tom asked the teacher some questions .
Tom didn &apos;t know who to give it to .
What caused the fire ?
Tom went to school with Mary .
The story about Tom eating my cat isn &apos;t true .
We &apos;ll eat at six o &apos;clock .
I don &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
They can &apos;t see you .
Tom became very cold .
Tom didn &apos;t want his friends to see him cry .
I &apos;ve already had a coffee .
Tom said nothing at all .
I didn &apos;t want to speak to anyone .
I understand why you &apos;re here .
I want to go to bed early .
He &apos;s only a couple of years younger than me .
She fell in love with the new teacher .
Get these people out of here .
My family is very proud of me .
I already know your secret .
He had barely enough money to buy bread and milk .
When will you visit me again ?
This car &apos;s mine .
Tom will come soon .
Tom smiled .
I didn &apos;t need Tom &apos;s money .
I think this is a good thing .
Tom looked into the room .
Come help me .
I &apos;ll lend you this book .
&quot; What would you like to buy ? &quot; &quot; I would like to buy a dog . &quot;
I &apos;ve known him ever since he was a child .
I &apos;d prefer to speak French .
May I do that with Tom ?
All my friends have children .
We saw this coming .
He has no children .
Why did you buy another car ?
I &apos;ll be outside if you need me .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom today .
What kind of car does Tom drive ?
Tom is looking at me .
We don &apos;t listen to each other enough .
I am trying to help him .
I &apos;m very , very happy for Tom .
I think Mary likes me .
Tom isn &apos;t in there .
Everybody &apos;s safe .
Tom stole my heart .
She &apos;s my best friend .
Are you here ?
I never saw him before .
Tom &apos;s new book is about Mary .
She would rather go by train than by plane .
How long has it been since you heard from him ?
Tom says you want to go to Boston with us .
I gave him advice , to which he paid no attention .
I don &apos;t think people use that word anymore .
I don &apos;t think Mary is as pretty as Alice .
Your bag &apos;s open .
I &apos;m running out of time .
Is it done ?
How do you feel ?
He was busy when I called him up .
It &apos;s been raining for about a week .
Why do you walk when you have a car ?
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
Nobody knows what has become of her .
Tom is very honest .
Look what I did .
I read about that .
You &apos;d better not wait here .
I &apos;ve already done that once today .
Tom is not the problem .
I know something Tom doesn &apos;t know .
Tom seemed sad .
Tom found a new job .
I don &apos;t know what Tom &apos;s problem is .
He &apos;s afraid of cats .
What time is your bus ?
Have you decided on a name for your baby ?
I &apos;ll be OK .
This was my mistake .
I understand what you &apos;re saying .
I have to go there myself .
It is difficult to talk to him .
Do you think Tom saw Mary ?
Is somebody out there ?
There &apos;s no one here .
He doesn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
What do you see out there ?
She sold him her car .
Tom isn &apos;t coming here .
He &apos;s getting up early .
Tom and Mary are both older than John .
I &apos;d like to help , but I can &apos;t .
I &apos;ve been waiting a long time for you .
Please let go of my arm .
I haven &apos;t seen that in a long time .
What are you guys planning ?
I don &apos;t want to die here .
They &apos;ll be back soon .
She got the money from him .
I think I could learn a lot from you .
They made me go there alone .
Tom wants me to do it .
She has never seen him .
I think that was the best movie I &apos;ve ever seen .
I don &apos;t see Tom &apos;s car .
The letter does not say what time she will come up to Tokyo .
I looked at my dog .
How do you do that ?
Does it have to be Tom ?
I haven &apos;t heard from Tom yet .
Isn &apos;t that why we &apos;re here ?
I hear the phone .
Tom is seldom home .
How long do you think we &apos;ll have to wait ?
You don &apos;t know Tom like I do .
We have dinner at seven .
That &apos;s how I came to know her .
What are you doing there ?
What &apos;s Tom standing there for ?
Has Tom left yet ?
Will you go with us ?
Come on in , Tom .
How long do we have to wait here ?
Tom seldom wears a hat .
He smiled .
I was hungry .
Tom wanted to learn how to read .
I waited .
I wish you &apos;d said that before .
Tom is willing to do almost anything for money .
I have to support a large family .
How are you guys doing ?
Aren &apos;t you feeling well ?
He comes home almost every weekend .
Tom is awake now .
We &apos;ll eat lunch after we get home .
Tom is going to miss doing this .
I &apos;ve never seen that man before in my life .
Tom looked very tired when he got home .
I can see a woman and two dogs in the car .
He closed the door suddenly .
This information must not fall into enemy hands .
The train came on time .
Tom gave it back to Mary .
She is willing to do anything for me .
We know you &apos;re in here .
Are you sure there &apos;s nothing else to eat ?
Do you know how to drive a car ?
I was just about to leave .
I only drink water .
Keep walking .
He is on the team .
Tom said he wants to go .
You shouldn &apos;t speak so ill of him .
I don &apos;t want to stop working .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a wife .
What do you do ?
What would you say if you were in my place ?
Tom doesn &apos;t ever want to see Mary again .
I know who you were with .
I know where the key is .
I &apos;ve studied French for years .
I don &apos;t see how .
If I were rich , I &apos;d go abroad .
He &apos;ll be back in a few minutes .
I know her well .
I would like to come and see you .
She must have been rich .
I hate coffee .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Tom is finally going to do what he told us he &apos;d do .
I cannot thank you too much .
There &apos;s nothing on television that I want to watch .
It was Tom &apos;s .
May I have a word with you ?
Tom came home drunk last night .
This clock is out of order .
This is my daughter .
It seems impossible that you &apos;re that old .
What did Tom get me ?
Is Tom lonely ?
It wasn &apos;t like that at first .
Why aren &apos;t you sitting down ?
He asked me to open the door .
This hat doesn &apos;t fit me .
I thought I could help Tom , but I couldn &apos;t .
I &apos;m going to need more help .
She &apos;s my first love .
The question is whether he &apos;ll read the letter or not .
Tom seldom goes to church .
He said , &quot; I want to be a doctor . &quot;
Tom asked Mary for advice .
That &apos;s where I want to be .
I wanted to go there .
Tom &apos;s apartment was small .
This is not my car .
How does Tom get to school ?
You don &apos;t need to answer that question .
I want to live in a small town .
The train hasn &apos;t come yet .
I like them both .
Tom comes from Boston .
Tom had to stay in the hospital for three weeks .
You should eat something before you go .
We all miss you very much .
Tom will let you do that .
I want to learn how to speak French .
Nobody believes what I say .
Don &apos;t you know what to do ?
You run .
What &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
I am disappointed at the news .
Leave it where you found it .
I want to help if I can .
Tom wanted to meet you .
I still don &apos;t speak French very well .
Why is everybody making such a big deal about this ?
I would like something to read .
Tom was hurt in the accident .
Do you know what Tom said ?
Tom &apos;s French is better than mine .
He tried it with a friend .
He &apos;s rich .
Tom asked Mary whether she &apos;d like to go shopping .
Maybe we shouldn &apos;t have taken this road .
I had the same problem as you did .
My mother was up late last night .
Tom is still studying French .
How are Tom and Mary ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to ever do that again .
Did it help ?
Tom is very fast .
Tom gets along well with Mary .
When does he come ?
How do we know that ?
I &apos;m very tired and I want to go to bed early .
I don &apos;t want to go to church today .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll be careful .
I don &apos;t understand this .
I don &apos;t have as many friends as Tom .
Tom likes wine .
Tom knows what &apos;s coming .
Tom told me he wanted to leave the company .
Have you ever gone to the beach with Tom ?
Tom was early .
Could you translate that for me ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom still lives here or not .
Tom doesn &apos;t like working in the garden .
Tom is angry .
I &apos;m not going to school today .
I know where to find water .
That &apos;s my book .
Where did you see her ?
Tell me everything you know about Tom .
Tom is your father .
You &apos;re supposed to be in bed .
You do your thing , I &apos;ll do mine .
Where are your things ?
He &apos;s your father .
I missed the train . I should have come earlier .
Tom wasn &apos;t very sick .
You ought to have known better .
I admit my mistake .
Would you like it now ?
He arrived rather late .
We were expecting it .
You know how .
Let &apos;s have a party tonight .
That &apos;s good advice .
We must leave right away .
I &apos;ve seen that , too .
This is a picture of my family .
I was the one who said we should wait .
His hands were empty .
What are you laughing at ?
You need not have called me .
This is something Tom made for you .
I &apos;m Tom and this is Mary .
You promised .
I want your answer by the end of the day .
They can &apos;t hear you .
It &apos;ll stop raining before long .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have lied .
We have three minutes .
This is the book I told you about .
That &apos;s what I heard .
I went to school yesterday .
Tom took out a pencil and started to write .
Tom is quite tall .
Come to my house at eight .
I haven &apos;t had dinner .
They were all surprised to see me there .
Tom usually eats too quickly .
Would you like to play with us ?
Here &apos;s your money .
How did Tom get to know Mary ?
I haven &apos;t finished speaking yet .
They want this .
There is the train at 10 o &apos;clock .
Tom never stopped .
My parents don &apos;t understand me .
I &apos;ve seen it with my own eyes .
Tom thinks I &apos;m crazy .
It should be fun doing that .
Is that your room ?
These are my books , and those are his books .
I &apos;ll never be as good as Tom .
I am not what I was ten years ago .
I don &apos;t know whether to go or to stay .
There &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
Tom said he was too busy to help Mary do that .
Tom called the police .
I &apos;m still Mary &apos;s boyfriend , I think .
I won &apos;t forget that .
It &apos;s raining where Tom is .
They &apos;ll find you .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants to do .
I haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s brother .
We &apos;re both fine .
Tom is good at it , too .
I thought he had died .
How did you get into my house ?
My phone was broken .
I received your letter yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t talk to me about anything anymore .
Is Tom good at driving ?
Tom seems pretty happy .
I was happy .
Do you like my friend ?
How big is your school ?
I can &apos;t talk about this right now .
I will be free tomorrow afternoon .
They &apos;ll find him .
Can I try it ?
Tom waited for Mary .
I am a boy .
Do you like soccer ?
I don &apos;t feel well .
We &apos;d better call the police .
She gave me some good advice .
Do I have to pay you ?
Have you talked to Tom about this ?
Don &apos;t let him know her address .
What &apos;s it like in Boston ?
This is too long .
I think Tom is a nice name .
Mary says she &apos;s never had a boyfriend .
We can &apos;t leave yet . We need to wait for Tom .
My daughter is still at work .
She was born last year .
I want to show you something in my office .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear shoes inside the house .
What if he doesn &apos;t want to talk to me ?
I think you know what I want .
Tom asked Mary to sit down .
I will be back by nine .
Come here . I want to show you something .
He is never in the office in the morning .
Tom loves Mary and she loves him .
I will try to do my best .
If only I had known the answer yesterday !
We &apos;re going ahead with this .
I &apos;d like a little more time .
She is interested in music .
It &apos;s his problem , not mine .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you doing that .
They say she &apos;s sick .
You know it &apos;ll be fine .
The news made her happy .
They made fun of me .
If you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll ask someone else to help me .
I don &apos;t know what to sing .
I am very tired .
They look like us .
I wonder what has made him change his mind .
I was angry .
What pretty eyes you have !
Have you told your mom ?
If you eat too much , you will get fat .
Most people think I &apos;m crazy .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
I don &apos;t think I can do anything else .
Are you really awake ?
I think we should wait until Tom gets here .
Tom likes to do everything himself .
Put your hands up !
I did that a lot .
Are you , by any chance , afraid of me ?
This book has a lot of pictures .
It is clear that he knows the answer .
Will Tom do that with us ?
This book is older than that one .
Do you think we &apos;ll get there on time ?
Tom doesn &apos;t understand me .
Do you want to talk ?
It &apos;s more trouble than it &apos;s worth .
Where are the parents ?
Tom gave me his phone number .
Tom is the new boss .
Tom is never at home .
I am sorry to have kept you waiting .
He &apos;ll be taking an exam next week .
He gets tired easily .
Someone else might want your old desk if you don &apos;t want it anymore .
Tom thinks Mary is kind of cute .
This makes me think of you .
Tom has been doing that for a number of years .
We &apos;re happy to be here .
They wash their hands .
I just can &apos;t do it .
You speak good English .
Tom is like my brother .
What can you tell me about that ?
The baby can stand but can &apos;t walk .
Tom &apos;s explanation was interesting .
What are we doing today ?
This is probably Tom &apos;s bicycle .
I want to be a teacher .
That &apos;s what they do .
I think you missed the point .
This is what Tom wants .
Tom doesn &apos;t like soccer .
I don &apos;t know whether to go to the party or not .
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her .
Do you think he will like my gift ?
That meant a whole lot to me .
Tom might be innocent .
I &apos;m very worried about Tom .
She never found out the truth .
We should &apos;ve thought of this before .
I &apos;m not going to miss Tom .
Tom told Mary that he believed what John said .
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
I &apos;ll be seeing you again .
Tom walked past Mary .
Is it certain that he will help us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t play golf as much as he used to .
Do you think it would be possible for us to do that ?
Would you please lend me some money ?
Tom is too old to be living on his own .
Tom is not able to swim .
Why did you buy flowers ?
You &apos;re after Tom .
May I ask you to help me with something ?
I &apos;ll call again later .
Did Tom have his dinner ?
Tom and I will meet you there .
No one can stop us now .
The price is up to you .
They &apos;ll need help .
You really should &apos;ve gone by yourself .
I &apos;ll see you in October .
I &apos;m glad that you asked Tom for advice .
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say .
You could &apos;ve asked me .
Tom and Mary have nothing to do .
Tom asked a few questions .
What should we tell the others ?
She went to the park with him .
I know you want to be happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go out .
We happened to be in London at that time .
It was so funny , we couldn &apos;t stop laughing .
I didn &apos;t do anything to you .
Tom stopped reading for a moment .
I know what that is .
Tom is a good teacher .
Here &apos;s my address .
Tom is beginning to look pretty old .
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t realize it was that serious .
I don &apos;t know how to thank you .
Tom could have gone to the dance with Mary , but he didn &apos;t .
I haven &apos;t spoken French in a long time .
I knew I forgot something .
You can &apos;t eat here .
I &apos;m in bed reading .
I shouldn &apos;t have told you this .
Please take off your shoes .
Nobody asked Tom .
The party was just getting started .
I did everything right .
I don &apos;t know anything about Boston .
I &apos;m sorry I have to go .
Just do your best .
That &apos;s what we want .
Are you a new student ?
You &apos;d better not do it .
You can &apos;t let Tom go outside .
I &apos;ll ask Tom to wait .
Let &apos;s do this later .
I lost interest in my work .
Please be sure to come on time .
&quot; Where would you like to work ? &quot; &quot; In Australia . &quot;
Tom has done that .
The clock is fast .
Tom was lying on the bed .
I know what those books are like .
I &apos;m not a baby , you know !
Tom wanted to know everything about Mary .
What made him so angry then , I wonder ?
I wish I could be there with you .
Everything he said was right .
I &apos;m here again .
I look forward to meeting Tom .
The little boy grew very fast .
Tell me what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom got out of bed .
I &apos;m calling from Tom &apos;s place .
He &apos;s afraid that he might be late .
We had a good deal of rain last summer .
My sister has been sick .
Tom wants to talk .
We &apos;re not happy with this .
Tom likes Mary more than he likes Alice .
She tried to swim .
They are very far away .
Why are people scared of Tom ?
Everyone but Tom came .
I don &apos;t have my glasses with me .
Tom would never hurt you .
I &apos;m afraid he is ill .
What would you do if you were ten years younger ?
Tom asked Mary some questions that she didn &apos;t want to answer .
I haven &apos;t quite made up my mind .
Do you think Tom saw it , too ?
I didn &apos;t write this letter .
Tom has told us everything we need to know .
I &apos;m afraid I have no experience .
I need a bag . Will you lend me one ?
Tom says I have to study French .
You have to stop it .
He is no longer living here .
I had the same problem .
You do look good .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t swim .
You will know soon enough .
These are my brothers .
He &apos;s got enough money to buy a house .
I &apos;d like to know why you &apos;re here .
Tom might be able to help me .
I think I don &apos;t understand you .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along very well .
I didn &apos;t see it .
We just don &apos;t know why .
That boy is his brother .
Let &apos;s stay friends forever .
He always wants to have the last word .
Tom is going to give up .
They went crazy .
It &apos;s only three o &apos;clock .
Tom kept driving .
I &apos;m a child .
Why does Tom want me to do that ?
That &apos;s a hard question to answer .
I was surprised .
A friend is hard to find and easy to lose .
Why don &apos;t you want to go to Tom &apos;s ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know I &apos;m Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he &apos;d been .
He took a week off .
Tom isn &apos;t at school .
Nobody could &apos;ve expected this .
We &apos;re not students .
I have a lot of money .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have married Mary .
Are you still upset ?
What kind of English is that ?
Where &apos;s your bag ?
Tom isn &apos;t as tired as Mary .
My friends are all married .
I need to talk with you about Tom .
I live near her house , but I seldom see her .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t sick .
Tom made fun of Mary .
Tom wants to see you and me .
My dream is to be a doctor .
They &apos;re afraid of me .
He didn &apos;t do any work .
Mary came in .
Thanks for the explanation .
He was scared to do it .
Tom gave us nothing .
Would you like to go see a movie or something ?
Tom bought Mary a nice camera .
Let &apos;s go home .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
The message is written in French .
Tom said he was ready .
He bought vegetables and some fruit .
What does this have to do with school ?
We have the same problems as you .
I think Tom is just a little scared .
It was just a joke .
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary .
Tom knows Mary is right .
Tom will go to Boston next summer .
I wish I hadn &apos;t gotten married so young .
We are all looking forward to seeing you and your family .
I could swim well when I was a boy .
I know why that is .
I think we have to make a decision .
My mother can &apos;t come .
Here is the book you are looking for .
Tom is living with his uncle now .
Tom will never understand why we want him to do this .
Let &apos;s get back to the ship .
Do you have the money ?
Tom will do that again today .
Tell me what I want to know .
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary drive him home .
Tom was doing that here yesterday .
What made you do this ?
What time do you think Tom will be back ?
I know Tom is your friend .
I &apos;m very pleased to have met you .
We had less snow this winter than we had expected .
What happened to make you laugh so much ?
That &apos;s what I expected of my daughter .
I won &apos;t say a word .
I have lived here a long time .
He has bad eyes .
I &apos;m looking forward to tomorrow night .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s house to study .
Where does the airport bus leave from ?
We know you .
Tom has nothing to do with it .
The train leaves at nine o &apos;clock .
You may sit down on the chair .
I can &apos;t change that .
Tom didn &apos;t come yesterday .
It &apos;s raining , but I would like to go out .
Tom always had to do everything himself .
I know you &apos;re innocent .
It was Tom &apos;s idea .
It &apos;s going to take about three hours .
Can you handle it , Tom ?
Tom is still waiting for an answer .
Would you mind telling me what you &apos;re doing in my apartment ?
I knew Tom well .
Tom knows how to swim .
Tom isn &apos;t OK .
Tom hasn &apos;t found Mary yet .
This was no accident .
I go to the movies every week .
Would you give me a cup of coffee ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for this moment .
It seems that she was ill .
People talk without having anything to say .
How much snow have you had ?
Tom said that Mary may do that .
I need to wash my hands .
It &apos;s too short .
She hardly ate anything .
You lied to my face .
Don &apos;t be like Tom .
Do you want to go out with me tonight ?
We both kissed Tom yesterday .
Do you want to go there ?
Please come home as quickly as possible .
You &apos;re up early .
I &apos;m not asking you to change your opinion .
They all look the same to me .
I think they do that on purpose .
You are no longer a baby .
He &apos;s up there waiting for you .
Tom and Mary want to talk to you .
We are students .
You shouldn &apos;t count on others for help .
Tom talked about himself .
Are they speaking French ?
We couldn &apos;t understand what the baby was trying to say .
Why is Tom &apos;s name not on the list ?
Some children are swimming in the river .
Do you know where Tom is waiting for us ?
Tom walked to the store to buy some milk .
I &apos;m here to ask for your help .
That &apos;s not true either .
I know you &apos;re busy , too .
Tom called Mary to ask if everything was OK .
What did you go there for ?
There &apos;s nothing to do here .
I don &apos;t think your name &apos;s Tom .
I asked Tom to be quiet .
Tom has a beautiful car .
I think Tom knows why Mary isn &apos;t here .
I can &apos;t let you leave .
No one came .
Tom promised me that he &apos;d be careful .
What &apos;s the best way to get to the airport ?
You &apos;re too good for Tom .
Tom was afraid to swim .
Why didn &apos;t you come ?
Everybody knows that .
I don &apos;t understand what you mean .
Tom needs somebody to help him .
Tell me something that I don &apos;t know .
They want me .
I know Tom &apos;s sister .
Every now and then they went shopping together .
Tom has never killed anybody .
The house appears to be empty .
How hot is too hot ?
Who &apos;s going to pay the bill ?
Please tell him to wait .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary about John .
I can do this alone .
Tom took off his glasses .
I thought that Tom was married .
We need something to eat .
Do you like coffee ?
I don &apos;t ever want to leave this room .
I am loved by my mother .
Who &apos;s that for ?
Do I really have to go to Australia with Tom ?
I think about Tom all day .
I have little money now .
The old man got off the bus .
Tom arrived early .
I am afraid of dying .
He is not any taller than I am .
I expect that Tom will do more .
This is difficult to do .
I stayed at my uncle &apos;s during the summer .
What did you drink this morning ?
Tom has changed a lot since the last time I saw him .
Tom and Mary are no longer a couple .
To tell the truth , I &apos;m not your father .
Tom isn &apos;t Canadian .
I &apos;ll teach you everything you need to know .
That &apos;s all .
Let them know we &apos;re busy .
Tom told Mary not to wait for John .
I didn &apos;t call Tom from Australia .
Tom isn &apos;t coming .
That &apos;s no good .
Tom said he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
How far is it from your house to town ?
It is true that he is good at playing golf .
This is my school .
You &apos;re not listening .
I don &apos;t think that Tom is asleep now .
Do you still believe Tom ?
We have not received a letter from him so far .
Your brother got married , didn &apos;t he ?
That is not exactly what I said .
Tom and Mary are expecting you .
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary .
I nearly died .
I give in .
Thank you for your help .
I don &apos;t have time for you .
I have just finished eating lunch .
Something &apos;s got to be done .
I &apos;ve got the money .
Maybe you don &apos;t want to remember .
I couldn &apos;t walk .
I &apos;m OK .
He came by bus .
If I &apos;d had enough money , I would &apos;ve bought the book .
I &apos;ll never tell anybody .
She fell asleep .
My mother is out .
She looked sad .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me what to do ?
He was very happy .
There &apos;s a mistake in the bill .
I &apos;m a student in a university .
He has written two books .
We &apos;ll leave at eight o &apos;clock .
I just want to find out what happened .
I like to read .
Tom is still sitting on the bench .
I ate fish yesterday .
I like dogs .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me anything about you .
Tom is in pain .
We &apos;re having fun .
Tom is a good friend of mine .
She &apos;s pleased with her new dress .
Don &apos;t feed the dog .
I think he &apos;s correct .
I want Tom to understand .
It would be a good idea to try doing that .
We prefer to stay here .
Can I ask a question ?
I need to be sure .
I know what you &apos;re probably thinking .
Tom saw you do that .
Mary may be cute , but I don &apos;t like her .
Look carefully . I &apos;m going to show you how it &apos;s done .
I really wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
Now is when you have to make up your mind .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to college .
No one saw a thing .
I think everything is ready .
Why do you want to know ?
What don &apos;t you want us to see ?
Come back home .
What time should I go to the airport ?
You can visit me tomorrow .
When you &apos;ve finished reading that book , I &apos;d like to read it .
She &apos;s older than Tom .
I don &apos;t want to think about what could &apos;ve happened .
Bring it to me .
I &apos;ll pay the bill .
Where is my beer ?
Do you think Tom loves Mary ?
She went out .
The boy fell from the bridge .
I come from Australia .
What &apos;re you so nervous about ?
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
I like the color of this car .
Tom has something he wants to say to you .
Tom lives with his family .
Tom does not look happy .
I love her sister very much .
I gave him what little money I had .
Tom had never really been close to anyone .
No one here has a car .
Tom may know Mary &apos;s telephone number .
He was absent from school yesterday .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve written anyone a letter .
What time does the next train leave ?
People like Tom .
I would have gone to the movies if I had had the time .
Get your hands off me .
Tom does nothing but play all day .
Tom is almost as tall as you .
They all went to the restaurant .
I think Tom likes me .
I don &apos;t want to be late for class on the first day .
We didn &apos;t get your letter until yesterday .
Go to sleep .
Are you out there ?
I think you &apos;re not my type .
He was sitting next to me .
The men go to work .
Who told you I would help you ?
How much money do you have ?
Tom speaks French about as well as Mary does .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I thought you might like one of these .
I like this school .
I could &apos;ve married Tom .
The problem is that Tom doesn &apos;t want to sit next to Mary .
I can &apos;t believe Tom bought that house .
He left the house .
I saw Tom on television .
Tom told a joke .
Keep out .
Where is Paris ?
Tom doesn &apos;t realize what he &apos;s lost .
I have to speak to Tom immediately .
Tom is a new student .
I don &apos;t have time to write .
Tom is afraid of making mistakes .
It &apos;s different .
That &apos;s very big .
I sent Tom my picture .
Tom and Mary are eating lunch .
Tom is here to see you .
If you change your mind , let me know .
I looked around me .
It was so cold that I couldn &apos;t sleep .
Tom doesn &apos;t like studying .
I like to drink .
Tom has given his word .
My garden is small .
I &apos;ve already read today &apos;s paper .
I found out what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
There &apos;s something here Tom should see .
You look hot .
I was home all day yesterday .
Everyone knows everyone else .
Tom had a dog .
I play tennis all the year around .
I wonder why Tom left Mary .
I thought you &apos;d never call .
I like this room .
I do not want to work .
Tom will be a university student this year .
I hate this school .
Do you know how to do that ?
Tom is the one who told me what to do .
Tom loved Mary , but she didn &apos;t like him at all .
We &apos;re short on time .
There &apos;s not a chance .
There is a television in this room .
So what happened ?
Tom spoke to me in French .
What kind of flowers do you like ?
Tom is still in love with you , I think .
You have one hour to get this done .
I have expected his death for six months .
Tom thinks I love Mary .
Tom has a sister in Boston .
She was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so .
Tom is my wife &apos;s friend .
Tom looks hungry .
Just give us a couple of minutes .
I &apos;d rather not discuss it right now .
I have to get some food .
No one told me about that .
Would you mind if I open the window ?
I can &apos;t really be certain that Tom didn &apos;t take the money .
May I use your phone ?
We &apos;ll do great .
I want to talk to you about Tom .
Don &apos;t forget your things .
It &apos;s not your fault .
Why am I still here ?
You should always keep your room clean .
Tom asked Mary the same question he had asked me .
Tom has a job .
You must do your best .
I said that I would help him .
Here we go .
What &apos;s that bird ?
I can &apos;t go to work in these clothes .
I can &apos;t do that now .
Don &apos;t you have a driver &apos;s license ?
He must have drunk too much last night .
I believe that he comes here .
Tom himself tried it .
If I had had enough money , I would have bought the bag .
I don &apos;t think you could ever do that by yourself .
I don &apos;t want a boyfriend .
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison .
It &apos;s not too deep .
Tom and I are mad at each other .
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore .
You can &apos;t talk to Tom like that .
I &apos;d rather not speak French .
I know you want to come home .
Did Tom find it ?
Don &apos;t forget that she &apos;s a woman .
We need a plan .
He &apos;s not always happy .
These glasses do not fit me well . They are too large .
Tom doesn &apos;t live very far away .
I like rice more than bread .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
This is my brother , Tom .
Tom called Mary .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what he was going to say .
Is there anything more I can do ?
We still need more time .
Give me three weeks .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong .
Tom has to stay in bed .
The doctor advised him to work less .
I &apos;m a little cold .
Can I see your driver &apos;s license ?
Give me my glasses .
They know something we don &apos;t .
Let &apos;s do it again .
He had no friend to talk to .
Is Tom awake ?
He has a brother in Tokyo .
Thanks for telling me the truth .
Show me your passport , please .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at home .
Let &apos;s go to Boston together .
He got very drunk .
I was up all night writing this report .
The only one we have is this one here .
Why is Tom running ?
I know your language .
Tom must &apos;ve won .
His story turned out to be true .
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture .
Tom loves us .
I &apos;m going to the bank .
I can &apos;t afford a camera as good as yours .
What do you think she is going to do ?
He looks as if he had been ill .
Don &apos;t go in there , Tom .
You can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
How are you going to convince Tom ?
There is no telling what he is thinking .
Aren &apos;t you Canadian ?
My car is over there .
Our train stopped suddenly .
Who wrote the letter ?
This is Tom &apos;s cat .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary right now .
I know you want to be rich .
They &apos;re mine .
The proposal came up last week .
Today isn &apos;t my birthday .
Come and see me when you have time .
Tom wanted to study with Mary .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come .
He did it for money .
Tom asked Mary out on a date .
Let &apos;s talk in my office .
He will be here soon .
He couldn &apos;t find the house .
I don &apos;t plan on telling Tom anything .
I don &apos;t have to wear glasses any more .
You may take the book .
Are you two happy ?
I wish I had been with her then .
I want to marry her .
I &apos;ll write to Tom again .
Everything &apos;s gone .
Tom isn &apos;t yet able to write his own name .
You can &apos;t make me love you .
Tom wants to see you .
I have one brother .
Tom and Mary are looking for you .
Who &apos;s she ?
Tom sat down at the piano and started to play .
Just give me what I want .
I would like to have some more water .
Why does it have to be me ?
I can &apos;t afford to live here anymore .
It hurt really bad .
Nothing much is happening yet .
Tom hasn &apos;t changed .
Let &apos;s drink the cup of tea here .
I have to study French .
Do you like the city ?
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
Tom could win .
It &apos;s my fault , not yours .
I &apos;m not quite finished yet .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know .
Can I ask you guys something ?
My life would have been completely empty without you .
He is Canadian .
Tom laughed and Mary laughed with him .
I wasn &apos;t in time for school this morning .
Tom asked for Mary &apos;s help .
This is where it began .
Tom stayed over .
John was born in America .
The piano won &apos;t go through that door .
Did something seem wrong ?
He knows where we live .
The only one here who doesn &apos;t enjoy doing that is Tom .
We didn &apos;t know what to do .
I want to give this to Tom .
We want Tom to help Mary .
We can do a lot better than this .
He was impressed .
Tom can &apos;t leave just yet .
What did they want ?
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play .
My dogs are white .
I &apos;m married .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
I &apos;d like to sit by the window .
I know the person you are talking about .
Are you there ?
Tom let me down .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d see Tom again .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for Mary ?
I &apos;ll catch up with you later .
His house is on the other side of the bridge .
Why do you want that anyway ?
Tom and Mary both look up .
We know where it is .
We should wait here for the moment .
Tom and Mary got along very well .
Has this ever happened to you before ?
Why aren &apos;t they back ?
He doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
Don &apos;t be too long .
Nobody has seen the bird fly .
We &apos;re quite tired .
You can take a taxi .
She loves him .
He seems honest .
Perhaps it &apos;s time you told Tom about your accident .
Why don &apos;t you give it a try ?
I am tired of the work .
There must be a way we can convince Tom to work for us .
It &apos;ll be over soon .
Don &apos;t say things like that .
Am I supposed to leave now ?
Tom seldom gets sick .
How is the family ?
Why don &apos;t we take him a bottle of wine ?
Do you want to take one ?
Aren &apos;t you from Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell me everything .
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve said .
Tom and Mary seem pretty happy together .
He didn &apos;t stop talking .
Are you sure this is what Tom wanted us to buy ?
His brother is married , but he doesn &apos;t have children .
I was with Tom the night he died .
You don &apos;t want to make Tom mad , do you ?
You really did a good job .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything to me .
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary .
Let &apos;s have a try .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is happy or not .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to stay .
Tom told me he was really hungry .
I read your letter to my family .
Tom wondered whether he should let Mary go to Australia with John .
I &apos;m never going to leave you again .
I &apos;m a bit tired .
We appreciate you coming .
Tom has a lot of experience .
Tom was too tired to speak .
When did it happen ?
We need to call the police .
I &apos;m happy you &apos;re here .
Whose camera is this ?
I &apos;ve been seen .
I &apos;ve got to find Tom .
Where is my car ?
I must say something .
Look at that house .
Tom talks to Mary a lot .
They can &apos;t do this .
I &apos;m totally confused .
He has few friends .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t help Mary .
She could not find her way back .
Tom had to sell his house .
I can do it now .
Did you ask Tom why he wasn &apos;t at the meeting ?
She spent more money than usual .
Tom was the only one who knew the answer .
We see what we expect to see .
I met a friend I hadn &apos;t seen for three years .
Where are we eating tonight ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t mind .
Tom doesn &apos;t talk to me anymore .
I &apos;m sorry . I know I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
She &apos;s popular , not because she &apos;s beautiful , but because she &apos;s kind to everyone .
You decide .
I &apos;m happy to be able to help you .
It has nothing to do with me .
How large is your family ?
Have you already eaten ?
I really should have called .
Tom is always very busy .
I love Mary .
Boston is where I want to go .
Why weren &apos;t you at school today ?
Tom drove back to Mary &apos;s house .
I feel like drinking a beer .
Tom said that I had to study French .
I &apos;d like to go , too .
Tom &apos;s sister is younger than mine .
We &apos;re no longer in danger .
This doesn &apos;t make a whole lot of sense .
She gave it to me .
I am going to buy a new car .
We &apos;ll wait a while .
Do you speak French well ?
Children really do grow up quickly .
There is nothing in this world that I am afraid of .
I know who you are .
Do you want to leave ?
How tall you are !
Everybody &apos;s talking about it .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy everything we need .
There was an accident .
He sounds disappointed .
Tom knew about this .
Tom died , not Mary .
I will deal with this problem .
Tom put his hand on his heart .
Do you know the man standing on the bridge ?
It &apos;s raining , but she &apos;s not wearing a coat .
We just want to have a few questions answered .
I slept all day yesterday .
You should play golf .
I waited for him till ten .
Tom told me he wanted to quit .
This is the book that I told you about .
I don &apos;t know what to do first .
Mary is a good girl .
I &apos;d like you to go with me .
I &apos;ll join you .
I used to live near here .
I love my dad .
I have a girlfriend .
I took the book .
I now live in a very small house .
Tom told me that he was cold .
I &apos;m not the only one who got here early .
Tom refused to answer questions .
The party &apos;s over .
Tom is thinking about the problem .
Is it really that simple ?
I have two children .
Take everything .
I know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Tom asked me for a glass of water .
Does Tom like it there ?
Who &apos;s going to do this ?
I thought Tom wanted to marry Mary .
Don &apos;t do that to me .
How did he come here ?
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
She didn &apos;t visit anybody .
You &apos;re perfect the way you are .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he &apos;ll lose .
Tom is like me .
Tom and Mary seldom speak to each other in French .
I like apples .
Did Tom go alone ?
I &apos;m sure Tom told you .
Do you want to play tennis with us ?
I don &apos;t know that word .
Tom wanted to succeed .
Tom let me win .
I expect that he will help us .
He just wants to be left alone .
What have you been doing this week ?
Leave us alone , please .
I can &apos;t look at this anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t ask .
You will have to apologize when you see him .
This color doesn &apos;t suit you .
I &apos;m going to need you later .
Are you scared of me ?
Where did you find that dress ?
I don &apos;t know how you do that .
Tom may be in Boston .
Who &apos;s going to pay for all of this ?
I know where you were yesterday evening .
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me .
That was stupid .
Tom gave it to Mary .
Why is it a good thing ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like driving in the rain .
Tom said you &apos;d do that for Mary .
All Tom can think about is Mary .
Tom let Mary kiss him .
It kept raining all day long .
You &apos;re going to need your umbrella .
He has the same camera as I have .
This is my book .
We have no sugar .
Tom is a big man .
Where do you want it ?
Tom &apos;s coming .
Do you know how that could &apos;ve happened ?
Tom is quite happy .
Could I have a word with Tom ?
We aren &apos;t always right .
Tom didn &apos;t believe Mary .
They killed Tom .
It &apos;s good to have you here .
This question is easy to answer .
I trust that I can see you again .
This is not funny .
Let me pay for your coffee .
It &apos;s been three years since I &apos;ve been to Boston .
We &apos;ll work tomorrow .
She got up at seven in the morning .
Do you think Tom did this ?
I wanted to say that I &apos;m sorry .
Ask Tom to wait till I come .
I was tired .
She &apos;s busy now , so she can &apos;t talk with you .
We &apos;ve won !
Are you able to type ?
Was the door closed ?
There &apos;s a car coming .
He has come from Boston .
Is it money you want ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened because he wasn &apos;t there .
I found the picture Tom was looking for .
Tom is still in bed .
Tom helped us do that .
I am afraid .
She likes to read books .
How long have you lived here ?
Tom brought me this book .
That &apos;s the only answer I can give .
Tom is from here .
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;ll have to go home now .
We &apos;ll arrive in three hours if we drive .
When do you think you &apos;ll see Tom ?
I made this chair .
Tom waited for Mary until 2 : 30 .
Tom put a cup of coffee in front of Mary .
Your friend is here .
I think it &apos;s OK .
A child needs love .
The kitchen was clean .
This might be Tom &apos;s desk .
Tom always had a lot of money .
This is one of mine .
Where &apos;s my desk ?
Is it true that you and Tom got married ?
What do Tom and Mary do ?
My brother works in a bank .
You &apos;d better hurry up .
I &apos;m your boss .
I don &apos;t have a brother .
I &apos;ve got nothing to do .
She is quite satisfied with her life as it is .
Tom comes to school by car .
Tom laughed at Mary &apos;s jokes .
I need my key .
Tom began to understand .
Tom returned a few hours later .
There &apos;s a lot to do .
Tom and I are both in the same situation .
He said he was poor .
I like to work .
I feel blue .
I will show you around the city .
You know the way , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m being honest .
I was young and innocent .
I don &apos;t want to do that with Tom .
I &apos;ve forgotten the name of Tom &apos;s wife .
He &apos;s better than us all .
Tom believes him .
I wanted to make Tom feel at home .
Tom never talks about his work .
I can &apos;t be something I &apos;m not .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I can swim .
Can I trust Tom ?
Tom visited Mary yesterday .
I &apos;m sure Tom will apologize .
Do you know this part of the city very well ?
What do your children usually eat for breakfast ?
I have to buy a car this weekend .
She stayed there for a moment .
How do you like Boston ?
I have a lot of things to tell you .
It is not known when he came up to London .
Tom knew you would try to convince him not to go .
Mary is a good mother .
Tom eats nothing but fruit .
There is a book on the table .
I took the bus back .
Come swim with me .
The family wants to buy a house .
He found my bike .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was your friend .
This isn &apos;t yours .
Tom wasn &apos;t poor .
I don &apos;t want to get married , but I want to have kids .
What makes you think that I &apos;m against that ?
Tom ate dinner .
What do you want to see ?
What do you think of me ?
She promised not to be late again .
Your story wasn &apos;t interesting .
We rarely go out .
I &apos;m just glad no one was killed .
I want a car , but I have no money to buy one .
You must be tired .
I &apos;d like you to do it , too .
I &apos;m right , aren &apos;t I ?
We &apos;re on your side .
Which one do you think Tom is going to buy ?
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV .
Tom can play the piano much better than me .
I knew it was Tom .
I wonder if I hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s uncle .
Tom and I were like brothers .
Tom doesn &apos;t like doing that .
My mother can &apos;t read without glasses .
I can do that right now .
I know his brother well .
Where were you when Tom needed help ?
Be kind to others .
I &apos;m living in the city .
I don &apos;t like that anymore .
Tom really wants to help .
You may go at once .
That &apos;s what people don &apos;t understand .
Tom seldom speaks to us anymore .
He lost sight of that bird .
Tell me everything you know .
Don &apos;t you want to swim today ?
Tom has never asked me for money .
Tom was probably right .
Is it very far from here ?
It &apos;s not the first time .
I &apos;ll go ask Tom .
My family loved Tom .
Tom told me his father wasn &apos;t home .
I want to know what &apos;s going on .
Do you know how to speak English ?
I saw the pictures .
Tom found me a good job .
Where did you work before you started working here ?
Why do you have to go ?
Tom asked Mary if she had a dog .
Tom is always reading .
She &apos;s gone on a trip .
The letter will arrive tomorrow .
Why didn &apos;t you say it like that ?
Tom didn &apos;t agree to my proposal .
Did you do your work ?
You &apos;re still a student , aren &apos;t you ?
He doesn &apos;t like fish .
Is there a good restaurant somewhere near here ?
Tom knows exactly what to do .
I &apos;ve never been married .
Tom got very busy .
He gets angry very easily .
Have you seen my son ?
Keep the kids inside .
I didn &apos;t immediately understand it .
She should listen more to other people .
When did you last see my brother ?
You are tired , and so am I .
I love you for that .
Tom will explain it to you .
We saw Tom .
I don &apos;t have the money .
Yesterday I bought a book .
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I &apos;m going to bed now .
What were you two doing there anyway ?
He felt as if he were in a dream .
It &apos;ll stop raining soon .
Tom isn &apos;t coming , either .
I didn &apos;t think Tom was shy .
I want my money .
Tom put on his glasses .
I can &apos;t eat fruit in the morning .
Tom said that he wanted to talk to me after school .
My brother seldom , if ever , goes to church .
There is a time for everything .
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
I want to feel important .
My hands are full .
I don &apos;t have a good feeling about this .
We were both drunk .
It &apos;s ten minutes to two .
We &apos;re out of tea .
Everyone should like that .
Tom likes what he does .
Tom had to stay in bed .
We found it .
It is nothing to me .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been saying all along .
I don &apos;t want to see that .
How long have you been standing here ?
Tom drinks a lot of beer .
Take this medicine twice a day .
When was it you first met Tom ?
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
I &apos;ve only had one boyfriend .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how strong you are .
Tom wants a book to read .
I didn &apos;t see anybody .
Who hit Tom ?
My wife is having a baby .
Why did Tom start studying French ?
Let &apos;s talk over a cup of coffee .
I saw the children walk across the street .
I would do anything for you .
You must be Tom &apos;s brother .
All the students study English .
I know the rules .
How does Tom do that ?
Are you certain about this ?
My uncle has made me what I am today .
Tom is feeling a little bit better today .
I &apos;m not sure who wrote this report .
I need you to do something for me .
I think Tom is in Boston .
I have lost interest in it .
I got a new pair of shoes .
I have your dog with me .
I asked Tom if he understood .
These books are new .
I don &apos;t like summer .
Tom doesn &apos;t look so busy .
There was a lot of snow last year .
I heard you .
I can &apos;t go to the movies .
I think so , too .
I just started crying .
His wife was killed in the accident .
I like to play golf .
Tom isn &apos;t the one , is he ?
I should &apos;ve called Tom .
Tom already knows what Mary wants to do .
Where are your parents ?
I cannot eat anything today .
That &apos;s how we want you to do it .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom do that ?
She must be very happy .
You dropped your pencil .
Could I borrow your car ?
I &apos;d rather stay at home than go to the movies .
Tell Mary I love her .
It &apos;s just a dream .
Tom has finally arrived .
No one saw me .
Tom likes to do things like that .
The pizza will be here in five minutes .
I hope he &apos;ll get better soon .
Do you know why he couldn &apos;t come ?
Could I have a cup of coffee ?
Is it this hot every day ?
I don &apos;t really like him .
It is stupid of you to make such a mistake .
I &apos;m just as old as Tom .
There is nothing to do today .
Tom won &apos;t know .
You should learn how to ride a bicycle .
He looked as if nothing had happened .
What Tom really wanted was a new guitar .
I did what I could . It &apos;s your turn now .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t together anymore .
Tom was lonely and wanted somebody to talk to .
The situation is getting worse every day .
Tom could hear Mary , but he couldn &apos;t see her .
It &apos;s always worth a try .
You don &apos;t have to stay .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait so long .
I &apos;ll cook .
I thought I heard you .
That &apos;s a lot !
What does it look like I &apos;m doing ?
I &apos;d like to see her again .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry anymore .
He did not see anyone else at the station .
I believed every word he said .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to wait for Mary .
That &apos;s my pencil .
Please take a seat .
A promise is a promise .
I &apos;ve finished reading that book .
I have to finish my homework before dinner .
Is French hard to learn ?
Tom didn &apos;t even look at Mary .
The movie was interesting .
Tom won &apos;t be able to go with us .
You &apos;ve got to stop doing this .
Tom called to tell Mary that he &apos;d be late .
I &apos;m happy to hear it .
I will do it myself .
Tom knew that he couldn &apos;t win .
You can go or stay , as you wish .
I don &apos;t have all day .
Do you let your children drink coffee ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to be there .
Tom brought me a glass of water .
It &apos;s happened to me .
You &apos;re always drinking alone .
I played tennis with Tom yesterday .
Is Boston far away ?
I know her .
It is good to see you .
What will your wife think ?
I need some time .
I paid .
Tom needs your help to do it .
I can swim as well as you .
Don &apos;t phone her now .
When I was your age , I was already married .
I don &apos;t want to play anymore .
She asked about the others .
He doesn &apos;t know English .
I &apos;ve been working here for many years .
Is Tom going with you ?
What time did you go to bed yesterday ?
Tom ran out of water .
Tom has lost his keys .
Tom didn &apos;t go alone .
She smiled .
Why don &apos;t you have a look ?
I &apos;m giving up on it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to his wife .
Tom loves soccer .
I heard her singing a song .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to read a book .
I had to work .
That &apos;s what I said all along .
What time are you planning to leave ?
Can all your children speak French ?
There &apos;s no one by that name here .
Have you finished your homework ?
We need to do this .
That &apos;s what my mom keeps telling me .
I go to the movies once in a while .
Tom always believes me .
Tom is going to miss doing that .
Is that something for me ?
I told Tom not to worry .
That &apos;s pretty easy to fix .
I asked where Tom was .
The whole town was very clean .
Tom loved the book Mary gave him .
Tom and Mary wanted to get married and have kids as soon as possible .
Tom asked me for something I couldn &apos;t give him .
Are we going far ?
Tom has a new girlfriend .
I can &apos;t just not do anything . I have to do something .
Thanks for nothing , Tom .
Tom told us about his trip .
How long will this take ?
Come out here .
I couldn &apos;t keep my mind off of Tom .
I am happy .
Tom had nothing to do with it .
Tom is making us do this .
I just found out about it .
Why are you so tired today ?
This isn &apos;t Australia .
The machine is out of order .
I &apos;ve got to make lunch .
He has many friends .
You have to be careful .
She felt a bit tired .
He was giving a speech .
I &apos;m not married .
Tom laughed for no reason .
Who &apos;s not busy ?
I &apos;m not convinced at all .
Where did that ship come from ?
I don &apos;t want anybody writing about me .
I &apos;m waiting for you .
It &apos;s all over .
What did Tom tell Mary to do ?
I can &apos;t trust him .
The plane took off at seven .
What are you going to do in Boston ?
I give you my word on it .
Mary is expecting .
Please make sure that you get home by 2 : 30 .
Is this our hotel ?
Tom is probably going to be able to answer your question .
What have you done with the watch I bought for you ?
Let &apos;s eat lunch outside .
I don &apos;t know how to use it .
Tom was able to solve the problem .
I have no idea what this is about .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink beer at home .
Tom is my name .
Tom speaks French as well as English .
Don &apos;t you get lonely out here all by yourself ?
I asked Tom to come yesterday , but he didn &apos;t come .
I &apos;m still your boss .
He was lying on his back on the beach .
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is .
I &apos;ve been here for an hour .
Where can I meet Tom ?
This is simple .
Tom knows what to do , doesn &apos;t he ?
This is new to me .
I &apos;m very surprised .
Do you still have all your teeth ?
It &apos;s time to go to school .
I &apos;m going to take a look .
Thank you for the tea .
I need to sleep now .
You don &apos;t look like your dad .
Look around you and tell me what you see .
Tom doesn &apos;t love you as much as I love you .
Tom said that he &apos;d help me .
Tom has lost face .
Everyone looked happy .
I sometimes make mistakes .
We have to leave now .
She wants to get a driver &apos;s license .
He is going to stay at a friend &apos;s house .
I need someone to understand me .
Tom plans to go to Boston by himself .
It was easy to answer .
Is that from Tom ?
We don &apos;t really have anything in common .
My dream is to study French in Paris .
Tom has been in Boston for a week now .
We &apos;re almost there .
What did you do at that moment ?
She played the piano well enough .
He was hard to please .
I didn &apos;t understand what he said .
I told Tom the bank was closed .
What do you think about the book ?
What makes you think Tom likes you ?
Tom and Mary have been married for about three years .
You must take this medicine , whether you like it or not .
I &apos;m eating an apple .
Tom didn &apos;t seem very sure of himself .
You might have left it in the car .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t alone .
She comes to visit us every now and then .
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom .
How did you come by this painting ?
You do good work .
My brother lives in a small village .
You should go to the doctor .
It &apos;s dangerous to go there alone .
I have something else I need to give you .
What in the world is this ?
Tom has a family now .
I have no choice .
I thought Tom would like to know .
This book is very good .
I &apos;d like to hear you play the piano .
What &apos;s there to eat ?
I &apos;m right behind you .
Tom may be innocent .
He taught me how to swim .
Please make way for him .
I never drink alone .
I hear that his father is in the hospital now .
This is Tom &apos;s sister .
I thought that you said you were bad at French .
I thought about my family .
Tom tried .
Tom isn &apos;t supposed to be eating now .
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
I want to know the reason .
I wish I had learned this in school .
It &apos;s still true today .
I stayed .
Tom said that he thought that I was dead .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me to do that .
Can I use this dictionary ?
He stole the money .
I have many books that I haven &apos;t read .
Are you planning to help them ?
I know too much .
You &apos;d better do that now .
Tom and I always tell each other everything .
I &apos;ll wait for you in my room .
That boy is in love with his teacher .
That &apos;s so sad .
I read a book while eating .
Tom often doesn &apos;t eat lunch until 2 : 30 .
He speaks as if he had read the book before .
We must deal with this problem .
You should find somebody else to help you .
Who listened ?
Tom won &apos;t listen .
That &apos;s what you said last time .
Tom must not find out the truth .
I know you know .
Tom finally spoke .
Tom comes to visit us every now and then .
You must keep your room clean .
I don &apos;t want to be here .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s boyfriend anymore .
Tom may win .
I &apos;d very much like to know your opinion .
Tom can play tennis quite well .
Tom was hurt .
I knew you &apos;d like that .
Tom is not like that all the time .
I thought Tom was going to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to take a taxi .
I think it &apos;ll be raining tomorrow .
Why didn &apos;t someone help Tom ?
I can &apos;t find Tom .
Tom was home alone at the time .
I was just going to do that .
My foot hurts .
The child ran to his mother .
What &apos;ve you got for me ?
I told you never to call me here .
I was not feeling well .
Are you sure of it ?
I gave it to Tom .
I want people to see it .
I wonder why Tom is so fat .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go .
Tom kept looking at Mary .
You know I don &apos;t have a car .
Let me go alone .
Is that your new book ?
We &apos;re very worried about you .
He went shopping .
Tom wears a hat every day .
How close are you to Tom ?
I think Tom is lonely .
You understand why , don &apos;t you ?
What &apos;s going on with you , Tom ?
I saw a dog .
There was a tall tree in front of my house .
I haven &apos;t been busy since yesterday .
This might be something we can use .
I have a different job now .
I know why Tom is here .
The door is still open .
They are not tired .
Nobody kissed Tom .
Tom never told anyone .
I couldn &apos;t stand .
I know you better than your wife does .
They know about it .
The solution was quite simple .
Can you please help me ?
I opened one eye .
My son is now as tall as I am .
Don &apos;t make noise .
Tom didn &apos;t hit Mary .
I didn &apos;t kill anybody .
I &apos;d like to show you something .
He has two cats .
I wasn &apos;t the only one who was there .
You know what to do , don &apos;t you ?
His car fell into the lake .
You aren &apos;t one of us .
I apologize if I hurt your feelings .
She went to the hospital by taxi .
The boss made them work day and night .
Did Tom come to Boston with you ?
Tom eats a lot of fruit .
I don &apos;t want to eat lunch with Tom .
My cat is sleeping on my bed .
Nobody was interested .
I &apos;m happy just to be near you .
Do you know all these people ?
Where did you find your key ?
Tom died there .
Why should I be scared ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have written that .
Do you want one of them ?
Tom is coming in .
Why didn &apos;t you come to the party ?
Do you think children born today will have better lives than their parents ?
We should try to convince Tom to stay with us for a few days .
Tom &apos;s door closed .
He often doesn &apos;t come to school .
He has come a long way .
I don &apos;t know whether I can do it , but I &apos;ll try .
Your mother is very young , isn &apos;t she ?
I &apos;m at the airport now .
Tom was very busy all day .
I &apos;m not sure whether Tom heard it or not .
The man driving the bus is a good friend of mine .
Tom felt at home .
Can we afford this ?
Tom thinks he knows why .
I &apos;m looking forward to the party .
Mary can speak Japanese .
I often hear her play the piano .
I was in the house .
Tom arrived in time for the meeting .
Tom told Mary she was beautiful .
Everybody agreed with his idea .
I want what Tom has .
Tom works at home .
Please come over here .
Why are you so busy today ?
Have you made a decision yet ?
The concert was short , but it was really good .
It is impossible for me to solve the problem .
He asked his father to take him to the store .
She wanted to be a teacher .
Whose is this book ?
Many people only speaks one language .
I am a teacher .
How long was Tom there ?
I &apos;m not a baby .
I almost never speak French .
Tom doesn &apos;t want this .
I only had two glasses of wine .
I don &apos;t see a problem .
When did you go there ?
They were busy .
I was in bed all day long yesterday .
Tom seemed very surprised when I told him about what had happened .
What did you do last night ?
I have to talk to Tom now .
He is tall .
Be happy for me .
Get in here , Tom .
The girl talking with Tom is Mary .
Do you have a brother ?
Did you hear that ?
It is pretty warm today .
I will make up for it next time .
Thank you for this , Tom .
This bridge won &apos;t last long .
Tom worked .
I want that to happen .
Come back later .
Can we believe them ?
Tom is likely to still be in his office .
We want a woman who &apos;s good at cooking .
I was impressed with her work .
Do you think you &apos;d like to live in Boston ?
It &apos;s too dark here to read a book .
How did Tom find you ?
Where have you been ? We were just about to call the police .
This house is very good .
I said I &apos;ll be fine .
Who taught Tom how to speak French ?
Tom is good at French .
I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
Tom didn &apos;t expect to lose .
Tom and Mary have come .
Did you hear what I said to Tom ?
Tom has something he wants to say .
You like Boston , don &apos;t you ?
My dad just called .
Tom said that .
Tom &apos;s hurt .
You don &apos;t look so good .
He isn &apos;t running .
The sky is getting dark .
Do you know how many people are here ?
Make sure you &apos;re here on time .
You don &apos;t like me , do you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy , does he ?
I &apos;ve just arrived in Boston .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t want to do that .
Is that what you think of me ?
Tom can &apos;t cook .
Whose umbrella did you use ?
You don &apos;t have to do it , but you should .
What time is it in Boston ?
I tried to tell you .
There is no telling when they will come .
Do you have a car ?
He gave away all his money .
Have you ever lost ?
How about a cup of hot coffee ?
I am a bad person .
Nobody really believed it .
How can you help Tom ?
I don &apos;t understand Tom .
Tom can &apos;t help you .
There is little hope of success .
You should probably tell Tom what to do .
I talked to Tom last week .
No one knows the answer .
They won &apos;t come until tomorrow .
Give Tom a break .
I thought you were a better guitar player than that .
You &apos;ll get it .
I met her late in the evening .
I &apos;m living in a town .
This is Tom &apos;s room .
Tom finally quit smoking .
Tom put on his glasses to read the contract .
I like fish more than meat .
Why can &apos;t you go now ?
Tom wanted to live in Boston .
I &apos;m not sure I want to do this .
I have no idea of what to expect .
She needs a coat .
Which bed do you want to use ?
I lost it .
Are Mary and Alice sisters ?
Tom likes playing with my dog .
I have my things .
My mother is beautiful .
The door will not open .
I took Tom to the hospital .
Tom isn &apos;t from Boston .
Tom is home .
Did Tom go , too ?
I bought a new bicycle .
Nothing could stop him .
She gave her father a tie .
Tom told me he wasn &apos;t feeling very well .
Tom loved his children more than anything .
Tom is very busy right now .
Is that all we need ?
What does Tom expect ?
I don &apos;t like her hat .
Do you want me to do that for you ?
I won &apos;t be ready .
Tom has been living in Boston for almost ten years .
A baby boy was born to them .
This is all the money that I have now .
Where &apos;s the girl ?
The room is full of people .
What is going on ?
Tom helped Mary into the car .
We &apos;re listening .
What are you doing here ?
These are beautiful flowers .
I &apos;ve decided to marry Tom .
Tom works for a bank .
I always wanted a dog .
May I leave now ?
I can &apos;t run as fast as he can .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen you around here before .
Why don &apos;t you get Tom to do that ?
I bought a camera for 30 dollars .
Tom is lucky he has so many friends .
Tom is good at what he does .
It &apos;s almost six .
The man reading a book over there is my father .
We haven &apos;t had much rain this year .
Everyone knows what they have to do , right ?
Where did you go yesterday ?
Tom speaks French well , but not as well as he speaks English .
I enjoyed every minute of it .
You can &apos;t trust what she says .
I hate winter .
Tom didn &apos;t even know that Mary was gone .
This floor is so clean you could eat off of it .
Tom hasn &apos;t written the letter yet .
He can speak and write French .
He is angry with you .
Can you believe that ?
I love coffee .
We have to be there .
I met a friend at the airport .
They haven &apos;t paid me anything yet .
I liked Tom .
That wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
It isn &apos;t my fault that it happened .
We &apos;re getting it .
What a beautiful city !
How did you enjoy the concert ?
I like your garden and the flowers in it .
Will you show me your passport , please ?
It &apos;s started again .
My mother and I were in the garden all afternoon .
I &apos;ve got to get to the bank .
Tom would wait .
I know some of these girls .
I &apos;d like your opinion on this .
There wasn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Is there anyone who speaks English ?
She will be happy when she gets married .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do this .
Are those my glasses ?
Which of those girls do you like ?
They &apos;re animals .
Is he coming by train or by bus ?
Don &apos;t give me a thing .
Tom told me you were with my son when he died .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
I was scared .
Tom left Australia a few days ago .
Yesterday I had my bicycle stolen .
Mary really looks pretty .
I have no idea what I &apos;m doing here .
You should go home now .
She smiled at her baby .
You don &apos;t even know who sent this to you .
I know where that is .
You think I did it , don &apos;t you ?
Tom lived alone .
I went out for a beer with my friends .
I went there .
I should &apos;ve been asked first .
Do you want me to go with Tom ?
Tom said Mary is very happy .
The car is very fast .
You will never know where he is .
I barely made the train .
Why is Tom good at French ?
I know what it was .
This car is fast .
I didn &apos;t have to pay .
I &apos;ve got to find it .
I am in Paris .
Where will you stay in Boston ?
He moved back with his parents .
I met her by chance .
Tom did a pretty good job .
Tom started doing that a few weeks ago .
I &apos;ve still got a lot of work to do .
I have no money in my pocket .
Tom and Mary love their children .
May I use this ?
You liked that movie , didn &apos;t you ?
They are big .
Tom left me for another woman .
What you &apos;ve heard about me isn &apos;t true .
How did you like it ?
You have no idea where we are , do you ?
I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
I fell into the water .
Tom may need help .
What does she do ?
Tom can &apos;t afford that .
I just want to be your friend , nothing more .
What should I tell the kids now ?
Everybody likes him .
Tom isn &apos;t like us .
I often see Tom leave early .
I think you should swim .
It can &apos;t be !
Did Tom say anything before he died ?
You have no right to tell me what to do .
Many people shop here .
I can &apos;t talk about this now .
Someone took my stuff .
You &apos;d better go by bus .
I don &apos;t blame Tom .
I didn &apos;t think you were going to make it .
She is not as pretty as her sister .
Are you with us ?
Tom and Mary are our best friends .
You should take it easy .
You &apos;ve often said so yourself .
I asked Tom to do that .
I don &apos;t like my school .
They know who he is .
You shouldn &apos;t talk when the teacher &apos;s talking .
Tom is just three years older than me .
I want to get married , just not to you .
Do you want to give up ?
My uncle works in this office .
How is your mother ?
Tom speaks quickly .
Was that fun to do ?
Would you like to study abroad ?
Who &apos;s coming with me ?
I have no time to read .
I think Tom and Mary are right .
We &apos;re going to see Tom again .
We &apos;re safe now , aren &apos;t we ?
Tom is coming here , isn &apos;t he ?
What did Tom take ?
Tom thinks that he &apos;s always right .
What do you think Tom would say if he knew we were here ?
I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t understand .
They missed a lot .
What does that have to do with me ?
I &apos;ve got Tom &apos;s keys .
They often help each other .
How far do we have to go ?
Tom isn &apos;t happy about it .
What have you done ?
How do you put up with it ?
If it sounds too good to be true , it &apos;s probably not true .
Tom and Mary are doing their homework .
Tom looked very tired .
Have you met him already ?
Let us go .
Don &apos;t you want me to do anything ?
Tom is just my age .
Her name is known all over the world .
I would like to get a camera like this .
You know who I am .
I have a couple of questions I need to ask .
Tom worked there .
I closed the door so no one could hear us .
We &apos;re not going out .
Tom said that I should leave .
Why did that matter ?
I look forward to reading your report .
He did what he had been told .
Tom should &apos;ve been here by 2 : 30 .
I wanted to speak in French with Tom .
That &apos;s not what Tom meant .
It will be finished in a day or two .
Tom is still angry .
He couldn &apos;t do such a thing .
I &apos;d better be going .
They left without me .
Where &apos;s your dog ?
Tom is a small boy .
I &apos;m supposed to wait for Tom .
I would enjoy that .
It looks almost new .
I actually felt bad for Tom .
I didn &apos;t want to sell my car , but I had no choice .
I really wish to see you today .
We have a problem .
I can &apos;t find my watch .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of Mary .
How about a song ?
You need to start meeting women .
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind all that much .
I want another beer .
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him .
I gave Mary a book .
I wonder why Tom is here .
Are you tall ?
What are these things ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like school .
Tom wants to learn how to play piano .
I called you this afternoon .
I &apos;m not doing that .
The money is gone .
Tom is already awake .
I &apos;m looking forward to Christmas .
Take this medicine every four hours .
Have you been busy recently ?
He &apos;s better at the piano than I am .
Give me some water , please .
I &apos;ll find something .
He came out of the room .
He really likes playing the guitar .
I &apos;ve seen a lot of Tom recently .
We &apos;re going to do that .
Where are the other girls ?
It doesn &apos;t fit .
The point is that they are hungry .
May I dance with you ?
Here he comes .
Let me know when you need me again .
I think the train will come soon .
I can &apos;t find my key .
You must be here by five .
Tom left the door open .
I want breakfast in my room .
When did you meet her ?
I would like to spend the whole morning like this .
Tom decided to take a day off .
Tom doesn &apos;t watch TV .
Tom said that I could spend the night at his place .
They just wanted to ask me a few questions .
What about your wife ?
They &apos;ll be playing soccer tomorrow .
I thought I told you already to go to bed .
He always talks as if he knows everything .
Did you use to live here ?
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing .
Tom had no reason not to do it .
What can you tell us ?
We &apos;re late for school .
She told everybody at work .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that at all .
Tom could speak French .
I don &apos;t want to leave Tom .
I &apos;m glad Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
Please give me one .
Where am I going to go ?
Why didn &apos;t you tell me Tom was here ?
He looks very good .
Who wrote the book ?
Is Tom still coming ?
Tom left three days ago .
I think that there is a man there .
I don &apos;t want to be your wife .
Tom ran to his car and got in .
If I were to tell you the truth , you would be surprised .
Both his parents are dead .
Tom isn &apos;t certain about the answer .
We went to Australia together three years ago .
Tom is too busy now to talk to you .
I know that I can &apos;t do that as well as you can .
I think it would be better if I went alone .
I &apos;m not as poor as I used to be .
I &apos;m not going to get it .
Tom knows him .
The man stood up .
What did you tell Tom about it ?
He raised his arm .
I thought he was honest .
Tom doesn &apos;t talk much .
I know exactly what Tom was doing .
I didn &apos;t see him again after that .
Do you think it means something ?
We &apos;re not friends anymore .
I wonder whether Tom knows how to speak French .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary .
Do you know him , by any chance ?
I didn &apos;t study .
I wish I could be in Boston now .
Leave your desk as it is .
When was the last time you made your bed ?
She fell on her face .
How could you know this was going to happen ?
Look at me when I &apos;m talking to you .
What do you think they want ?
Tom was just trying to be funny .
Tom never talked about it .
He wrote me a long letter .
I think Tom wants to see you .
Tom seems to be looking for someone .
They &apos;re not here .
I could hear everything .
Tom had no food .
I told you I don &apos;t want your help .
It looks so real .
Tom can swim as fast as you .
Tom can &apos;t walk .
I &apos;m not the only one who likes Tom .
I &apos;d like to ask a question .
He didn &apos;t see anybody .
I already miss Tom .
Go home .
She isn &apos;t afraid of death .
He cannot stop her .
Tom doesn &apos;t hate you .
I think I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
I like my coffee strong .
Tom is in there .
The baby needs its mother .
Tom came to Japan from Australia .
This is OK .
Tom doesn &apos;t know we &apos;re here .
Tom didn &apos;t plan on running into anyone he knew .
Everybody around here calls me Tom .
Tom caught a lot of fish yesterday .
Are we leaving now ?
Tom &apos;s injured .
I &apos;m not your brother .
It &apos;s Tom .
Tom left earlier .
Tom is still sick in bed .
I wasn &apos;t too surprised .
Thanks for that .
Why &apos;s Tom doing that ?
Where did you hear that story ?
I need someone who can speak French .
Do you have any water ?
You didn &apos;t tell him anything ?
What &apos;s going on in this town ?
I don &apos;t think I like it .
I think I won &apos;t do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
Were you busy ?
Tom only went to college for three months .
Have you been there ?
Tom looked cold .
Tom is like family .
Tom didn &apos;t hear anything .
I want to talk to Tom .
I decided to try again .
You &apos;re just like your mother .
How old do you have to be to drive a car ?
All were satisfied .
Was Tom working yesterday ?
My situation has changed .
I thought everybody knew that .
How did you guys meet ?
There &apos;s something else you need to do before you go home .
Tom was such a good kid .
Don &apos;t you have something to do ?
I wish I had married another man .
You worked hard .
We &apos;ll be in Boston all week .
The weather was getting worse and worse .
I hate Tom now .
I slept for three hours this afternoon .
I want you to take a break .
I think that Tom and Mary are in trouble .
The concert was a success .
I &apos;m busy right now and can &apos;t play with you .
Tom is done .
I want one , but not this one .
You don &apos;t actually believe that story ?
Tom said that you &apos;d be able to help me .
There are many books in my room .
I don &apos;t know how you can eat that .
Tom is already in Boston .
We &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
I know these students .
Tom heard Mary play the piano .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t have much money .
I can &apos;t go back to Australia . I &apos;m wanted by the police there .
What is Tom expecting Mary to do ?
Stop telling me what to do . You &apos;re not my mom .
Tom hates coming to Boston .
Tom has a dog .
I worked hard all day , so I was very tired .
How many hours a week do you work ?
Tom said Mary was too busy to help us .
Did you hear it too ?
Everyone &apos;s tired .
Why do you feel that way ?
She hates him .
We have come a long way .
It &apos;s true that Americans love pizza .
Where did you learn to dance like this ?
Tom likes it hot .
My father is busy now .
I think I can fix this .
Where do you guys live ?
I know he did it .
If she had told me the truth , I wouldn &apos;t be angry .
Tom did what he was told .
I went to church with Tom .
He is at the office .
You noticed it , too , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that , is he ?
Tom couldn &apos;t sleep .
Do you know how long they have been married ?
If you want to talk , let &apos;s talk .
Tom put the book on the desk .
In the summer , eggs go bad quickly .
I &apos;ll sing .
Most people like watching TV .
I want to read the book .
Have you been abroad ?
Tom has been sitting in that room alone for five hours .
I &apos;m taking Tom with me .
It will stop raining before long .
I have often been there .
I don &apos;t know if it will rain tomorrow or not .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll come up with something .
Which do you like better , meat or fish ?
Is Tom afraid yet ?
I couldn &apos;t help Tom do that .
I think that it &apos;s too big .
Tom is out .
Tom doesn &apos;t want it .
How did you learn that ?
I no longer need to work .
We &apos;re all happy .
Tom is waiting for Mary .
It &apos;s your move .
Take only one .
Tom &apos;ll talk .
I have about three times as many books as Tom .
Why are you doing that , Tom ?
I &apos;ve learned a lot of things from Tom .
It was lucky for you that you found it .
I &apos;m really looking forward to tonight &apos;s concert .
Where &apos;s the library ?
I &apos;ll catch the next bus .
Where &apos;re the shoes ?
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house .
He won &apos;t like this .
You remember what it was like , don &apos;t you ?
Tom is leaving .
Yesterday was a good day .
What did you do this morning ?
When you can &apos;t do what you want , you do what you can .
We ought to leave Tom alone .
He is a teacher .
What did you buy your boyfriend ?
I know that Tom can &apos;t understand French .
I advised him not to drive .
He should have done it that way .
He needs help .
You have many books .
I can &apos;t explain it any better than that . I wish I could .
The teacher spoke too fast for us to understand .
I &apos;m married to Tom .
I cannot do without this book .
I think he &apos;s going to be sick .
Most people in Boston don &apos;t really care what happens .
Was the movie good ?
Where did you learn to drive ?
I &apos;ve got no time for that now .
Tom drove away .
Everything seemed to be OK .
I &apos;m going to go there with Tom .
This is where I want to be .
I didn &apos;t understand any of that .
Did he go to see Mary ?
She is having coffee now .
Tom asked Mary to help .
I like that person .
I don &apos;t really understand why .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary ever again .
That is very expensive !
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s a doctor .
I will try .
That will put you in danger .
I seldom walk to work .
Put the child to sleep .
That could be dangerous .
I &apos;ve heard nothing .
You can go now .
We don &apos;t really feel safe .
I want to live in a town .
What language do they speak in the United States ?
I &apos;m coming home .
Tom is now on vacation , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m impressed with how well you speak French .
I have been living here for years .
What &apos;re you doing with that ?
I wish I &apos;d been there .
Tom should &apos;ve done that with us .
You look just like my sister .
He won &apos;t be away for long .
Tom was with me all day .
You know that .
I asked him to drive me home .
All my friends will be there .
It won &apos;t be that easy .
I &apos;ll see him again .
Is she nice ?
I don &apos;t like him coming to my house so often .
They pay Tom well .
Tell Tom I want to talk to him right away .
I &apos;m not angry with you .
Everybody knew .
I can &apos;t put up with the noise any longer .
I &apos;m in the park .
Tom likes to watch TV .
My dad doesn &apos;t like soccer .
Why didn &apos;t you stay with Tom ?
Where did they learn this ?
Tom is quite crazy .
No one is coming to save you .
I plan to tell Tom that I don &apos;t want to go .
I think that you ought to apologize to her .
Tom asked me to open the door .
Tom was popular .
They don &apos;t listen .
I am studying .
I don &apos;t want it anymore .
Tom promised .
There is only one bus every two hours .
Where can I get some ?
Tom believes everything Mary says .
Nobody asked for your help .
He &apos;s very kind to me .
I &apos;m happy about this .
No one here can swim .
Tom is more scared of Mary than she is of him .
He has never been abroad .
I like to eat .
I can teach you my language .
What were you doing at that time ?
Tom isn &apos;t funny .
My house is too small .
I think we found it .
How about some coffee ?
Can you tell me what Tom did ?
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee .
I met an old woman .
I don &apos;t know who to choose .
My brother is in Australia now .
I didn &apos;t know you had a boyfriend .
I want you to use it .
It &apos;s too difficult to explain .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have told Mary what John did .
I work a lot .
Tom likes it in Boston .
I told you this was going to be interesting .
I have almost no money now .
She has been watching television for three hours .
Please shut the door .
That happened here .
I &apos;m looking for my keys .
Tom knows I know .
There &apos;s a difference .
I &apos;m sorry for what I did .
Just don &apos;t say anything .
Tom left immediately .
You can &apos;t really expect to win .
Tom wants to learn to swim .
Tom has been told to do that by himself .
Tom says he wants to do that .
Tom caught the ball with one hand .
We want Tom .
How do you like that ?
Did Tom say something ?
I &apos;d like to drink a cup of tea .
It &apos;s now your turn .
All Tom does is sleep .
Tom said you &apos;d be able to help me .
What did he do after that ?
You &apos;re not Tom .
I think it &apos;ll rain today .
Give me the ball .
I need to sit down .
I let you down .
This trip was a success .
How long are you going for ?
Tom said that he wanted to help .
We don &apos;t have any sugar .
It was very simple .
I couldn &apos;t stop .
Are you with me ?
I know Tom .
We don &apos;t need them .
That could be a problem .
We &apos;ll go get Tom .
I want to live here .
I think he did it .
Tom became a policeman .
How &apos;d you do it ?
Tom wasn &apos;t like that .
Where do you think I met her ?
Tom was looking for you this morning .
Could you please tell me what &apos;s wrong ?
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston .
It isn &apos;t a real apartment .
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon .
Tom wants Mary to help John .
Did you buy a house in Germany ?
He had a dog .
Tom should never do that again .
I want to go to Australia .
There are a lot of bad people in the world .
Let &apos;s discuss your idea .
What else can I do ?
Tom was the last one to arrive here .
I need some water .
They were very kind to me .
What will we be doing this time next week ?
I &apos;d rather not go to Boston with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell me .
I can &apos;t change the way Tom is , but that doesn &apos;t stop me from trying .
What kind of house does Tom live in ?
No one will ever forget you .
It &apos;s the only one there is in the shop .
She cannot stop me .
I &apos;m here to take you home .
Today we &apos;ll eat dinner later than usual .
I need you to drive me to the station .
I left the window open .
Tom told me a good joke this morning .
The book is here .
I can &apos;t give Tom everything he wants .
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be very tired .
Did Tom help his mother yesterday ?
I &apos;m not sure what that means .
I wish that I were young again .
Tom and Mary want us to do that .
Tom already knew what to do .
I know your son .
We like Tom .
He has been working all day long .
That &apos;s nothing to be proud of .
We don &apos;t have a problem .
We need more time .
You could do that .
They have nothing to eat .
I like going to Boston .
This food does not agree with me .
He felt sad because he lost his father .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have enough money .
I met Tom on the street .
No one can stop me .
You have friends who can help you , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d love to have one of those .
The sun is about to set .
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died .
Do what you want .
Tom and I aren &apos;t coming .
Tom really made you happy , didn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m your best friend .
We don &apos;t have any more sugar .
I can &apos;t wait till next week .
I &apos;ve got a wife and three children .
Tom is strong .
Look at that tall building .
Tom laughed at me .
I think Tom moved to Boston .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know that Mary hates him .
Tom thought Mary would know where John was .
Don &apos;t be late .
Tom saw Mary working in her garden .
I didn &apos;t know exactly what to say .
We have to decide today .
Can you help us ?
How long is too long ?
Do you want something to drink ?
I think that he won &apos;t come .
I &apos;ve seen things .
That &apos;s more than I can handle alone .
She has five older brothers .
Do I have to do it right now ?
I thought it was really cute .
Tom &apos;s up .
All the food was gone .
There &apos;s no need to wash your hair every day .
I &apos;m in the house .
The only one I saw in the park was Tom .
Where do I go from here ?
She &apos;s three years older than me .
You &apos;re a good girl .
We are working for you .
I &apos;m not really sure why .
I &apos;m old , but I &apos;m not that old .
How do you know Tom likes Mary ?
I have won .
Whose dictionary is this ?
I &apos;d like to go with you .
It &apos;s hard to love somebody when you don &apos;t know whether they love you as much as you love them .
It is fun to speak in English .
I need Tom .
He &apos;s a good man .
We hardly know each other .
We &apos;re out of sugar .
You must help her .
Try it . You &apos;ll like it .
I &apos;m working on that .
Tom looked hungry .
Are they coming , too ?
I &apos;m getting better .
I &apos;m not interested in your opinion .
I &apos;m really tired tonight .
This shouldn &apos;t take too long .
I don &apos;t know how deep the lake is .
It &apos;s already dark .
I had dinner with Tom .
The teacher stood before the class .
We had a plan .
I will do anything but that .
Please call me a doctor .
If I knew him better , I would tell him the truth .
I wonder if we &apos;ll ever see Tom again .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve said that to many girls before .
It &apos;s been ten years since my grandfather died .
You must stay the night .
I am interested in getting a hat like this .
Tom worked for us for three years .
I &apos;ve been on the phone all afternoon .
We can wait .
I know how to do it .
I only wish it were that simple .
How do you like your new car ?
He has enough money to buy it .
I &apos;ll stay home tomorrow .
I met her on my way to school .
What are you reading now ?
I &apos;m supposed to be here all afternoon .
It &apos;s gotten dark .
She didn &apos;t arrive at the party , but nobody knows why .
I don &apos;t actually work here .
What did Tom just say to you ?
I know what her name is .
I saw a lot of things that day .
I didn &apos;t have lunch today .
When was the last time you were in Boston ?
Is your dad here ?
So far , Tom hasn &apos;t done anything .
You &apos;re looking good !
There is little hope that they are alive .
Aren &apos;t you hungry ?
I &apos;m sure my family is looking for me .
I heard you got married .
She seldom goes out .
Tom &apos;ll come .
Are you from Australia ?
I don &apos;t know where to go .
Tom is quite likely to be late .
We go there often .
Tom almost told Mary that he loved her .
You taught us that .
Tom has gone too far .
Tom is going home .
Why are you helping Tom ?
Tom forgot to write to Mary .
I &apos;m proud of my school .
There &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
Her dream is to visit Paris .
Tom seems to be very satisfied .
If he knew the truth , he would tell us .
Tom has to go home .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s address yet .
Have you seen this ?
That was your choice .
I knew we &apos;d win .
Tom said he wanted to take some pictures of us .
These aren &apos;t words .
What are you going to do about this ?
Come at any time you like .
Are you here to see me ?
I don &apos;t want to go with you .
Don &apos;t you come near me .
It is too warm for me .
Those flowers are beautiful .
I was not a bit tired .
I don &apos;t know which is which .
I have many things to do .
Something needs to be done .
We missed the last train .
We &apos;ll be here all day .
Tom seems tired .
Will Tom leave soon ?
Tom should have done it the way Mary told him to do it .
Tom wants you to have it .
This is big .
Tom isn &apos;t that type of guy .
It seems OK on paper , but I wonder if it &apos;s going to work .
When I returned home , my brother was doing his homework .
I &apos;m hungry because I haven &apos;t eaten .
Boston is where it all began .
I wanted to be free .
I can &apos;t leave Tom there .
I want something to drink .
Nobody in the world wants war .
Tom works slowly .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe Mary at all .
You should &apos;ve stayed in the hospital .
I remember it very well .
Tom knew he couldn &apos;t win .
Where &apos;s Tom going to go ?
I often played tennis when I was young .
They are all very happy .
He told his brother the story .
I don &apos;t know her address .
Do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
I need to let Tom know .
I cannot fix the computer .
Are those new shoes ?
How would you like your eggs ?
Tom hasn &apos;t done it yet .
Don &apos;t be late for school .
I can &apos;t wait to go on a vacation .
I still haven &apos;t paid Tom .
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m right .
You &apos;re the same age as my son .
Please don &apos;t drink from the bottle .
It is absolutely impossible .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted something to drink .
You must get ready quickly .
I don &apos;t like doing that .
How much do I owe you ?
Is Tom over there with you ?
I &apos;ve already seen Tom about that matter .
Who did this first ?
If you ever need a job , come see me .
I still haven &apos;t found work .
Do you have money ?
A piano is expensive .
When was the last time you were on a date ?
What does that have to do with it ?
I believe I am in the right .
Tom did well .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
The girl said that she had never heard of such a person .
Get it ready at once .
I came here to tell you that I found Tom .
I think the future looks good .
I got sick last week .
Tell him to call me .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom yet .
I know you &apos;ll be happy here .
I &apos;m not doing it again .
I was in Australia for a few weeks .
I &apos;ve given you my answer already .
Perhaps he will come .
You promised me .
I can &apos;t solve this problem . It &apos;s too difficult for me .
I lost my camera .
Did Tom tell the truth ?
The dog is white .
Can we go ?
I &apos;m playing with my cat .
Tom became serious .
What do you have for me today ?
Tom thinks you &apos;re cute .
Tom keeps his word .
Please stop it .
Please don &apos;t look at me like that .
My father has bought a new car .
Tell Tom why you &apos;re here .
Tom wants advice .
Tom barely spoke .
Is Tom tall ?
It &apos;s time to eat lunch .
Why do you have to be like that ?
I am trying to learn English .
She always looked happy , but never was .
Tom says he &apos;ll never give up .
I want Tom to leave .
I don &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Tom walked .
The girls won .
Tom is rich , but he &apos;s not happy .
Do you know where Tom and his friends went ?
May I use the phone ?
What &apos;s this computer doing here ?
Tom is no longer studying French .
Tom needs to do that as soon as possible .
He is getting old .
We only have tea .
Tom sat on the bed .
He arrived at the station at seven .
How many times has Tom done that this month ?
They &apos;ll look after me .
That building is our school .
I know where she lives .
You should &apos;ve gone there by yourself .
Tom got out of the car .
I called my lawyer .
I want to stay here longer .
Are you going to sing here ?
Tom felt safe .
These are my students .
Tom , there &apos;s something you should know about me .
Yesterday I played tennis for the first time .
I don &apos;t want Tom to make the same mistake I made .
Tom went to Boston by car .
Tom sat down next to Mary on the bench .
Let me pay .
Let &apos;s go outside and play in the snow .
We don &apos;t have school tomorrow .
One language is never enough .
What happened to Tom ?
I thought I had the right to fire anyone I wanted to .
Tom has been married three times .
Do you want to play soccer with us ?
We &apos;ll be happy to help .
Tom is good at French , isn &apos;t he ?
It just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
Tom and Mary got married when they were very young .
I met a student from America yesterday .
Tom ran back to the village .
We &apos;re here for Tom .
That &apos;s what we have to do .
Tom asked Mary to open the window .
Tom knew that what he did was wrong .
Tom didn &apos;t like beer at that time .
I think you look great .
I have something else to show you .
I think Tom said that .
I &apos;ll explain .
I have been to Europe twice .
You have to get enough sleep .
Tom wants to read a book .
This is the woman I told you about .
He does not need a wife to look after him .
He is lying on the bench .
He slept an hour .
Tom isn &apos;t able to do his job anymore .
Tom made Mary happy .
She really likes cats a lot .
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom the truth .
She might come tomorrow .
I paid thirty dollars for these shoes .
I asked Tom if there was something I could buy for him .
He doesn &apos;t know what it is to be poor .
It &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
Can anyone hear me ?
You &apos;ve never been as busy as I am right now .
Can you help us find Tom ?
Wait , you guys .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s brother ?
Did you find Tom or not ?
You didn &apos;t have to do that .
What does Tom really think ?
This isn &apos;t a joke .
He is thinking about the problem .
&quot; Do I have to do that ? &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have to , but it &apos;d be better if you did . &quot;
My father is always busy .
Do you like dogs ?
A contract with that company is worth next to nothing .
Tom can &apos;t remember .
The TV doesn &apos;t seem to be working .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to lose my job .
Why is he so popular ?
I broke my leg .
When will you come ?
You already paid .
What language is that ?
I only wish I could help all of you .
It &apos;s too late to visit Tom .
I &apos;m not giving this up .
Can I borrow your car tonight ?
Mary is so pretty .
I don &apos;t plan to meet Tom until tomorrow .
I bought a newspaper .
I just did it .
Do you want to see her very much ?
Aren &apos;t you cold ?
Tom knows best .
You speak French , right ?
I went to the bank .
They tell me you &apos;re OK .
Tom is still in Australia .
I &apos;ll go when I &apos;m ready .
I met him on the street by chance .
May I do it right now ?
I &apos;m sure Tom wouldn &apos;t be angry at Mary if there weren &apos;t a good reason to be .
I wonder whether or not Tom is as old as Mary .
We talked until two in the morning .
Did Tom tell anyone ?
I just got a letter from my girl .
You &apos;re the only friend I have .
How long have you been studying French ?
John arrived a week ago .
I don &apos;t like dogs .
What &apos;s the name of your ship ?
I know Tom can &apos;t understand French .
His grandfather is still very healthy for his age .
Tom isn &apos;t going to Boston .
The boy is nice .
Don &apos;t give me that , Tom .
This would &apos;ve been your room if you &apos;d decided to stay with us .
Can you drive a car ?
How can I get to the train station ?
I think I like it .
Tom barely speaks to Mary anymore .
I don &apos;t know what this is .
We don &apos;t study French .
What you do is up to you .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom now lives in Boston .
I have a cold .
I want the other one .
She has gone shopping .
What makes you think I &apos;m not happy ?
We can &apos;t give up .
Tom didn &apos;t know what else to do .
We have no choice .
I can &apos;t put up with him any longer .
I &apos;m too old to go to Germany .
Will you marry me ?
You &apos;re good at what you do .
She can speak French .
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do anymore .
How do I know it &apos;s you ?
Tom didn &apos;t look that happy .
Are you my enemy ?
I am going to write a letter tomorrow .
I &apos;ll be back after lunch .
You just have to trust me .
Why is Tom in the hospital ?
I knew it would happen sooner or later .
It &apos;ll definitely rain .
Tom &apos;ll die .
Tom and I are still friends .
What &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
You and I aren &apos;t like that .
I finally found out what happened .
I &apos;m afraid of my boss .
Where were you three years ago ?
I &apos;m looking for work .
Here is your key .
I need you to do it yourself .
Tell Tom we &apos;re waiting for him .
We happened to be in Boston then .
Tom asked for more money .
Tom isn &apos;t a good person .
Your car &apos;s here .
It happened to me about a year ago .
He &apos;s a little taller than you are .
Tom has made a lot of mistakes .
The key is on the table .
I thought of that .
Where are your clothes ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on around here .
I don &apos;t want to read this book .
Can I use this ?
He will not be back tomorrow .
Tom also has a brother .
I feel very good .
Tom is coming over this evening .
I bought a new car for Tom .
I don &apos;t know anyone who likes Tom .
We &apos;re not getting married .
I don &apos;t know what you do .
This must not happen again .
I think Tom was supposed to be here .
I stayed there for three days .
This is my last offer .
I &apos;ll do it myself .
I have a daughter that goes to school with Tom .
I would rather die than do it .
You &apos;re just doing your job .
Now I remember .
You must be the new teacher .
I met Mary yesterday .
I tried not to cry .
What were they thinking ?
How long does it take to go to the office from your home ?
I &apos;ll tell you later .
I &apos;ve got nothing to say to Tom .
I &apos;m almost done .
She turned down my offer .
What time do you close ?
I pretended that I didn &apos;t know Tom .
I am not certain about that .
Don &apos;t show off .
Don &apos;t you do that , Tom .
Are you important ?
Tom would like to buy a house in Boston .
Did Tom eat anything ?
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
He came back after two days .
How do you know Tom has a dog ?
These shoes belong to me .
He is in his library .
He is in great trouble .
I don &apos;t work here .
My mother is angry .
Are you through with the book ?
That &apos;s not what Tom wants you to do .
There is a shop in front of my house .
He goes to bed at eight o &apos;clock .
Which newspaper do you read ?
Stop saying that !
Tom doesn &apos;t have the time .
Did you guys hear what Tom said on TV ?
Be careful , Tom .
Tom should be back by 2 : 30 .
It &apos;s important for us to think about the future of the world .
She looks young .
He likes my jokes .
I &apos;ve got too much to do .
Why are we studying French ?
Tom has done more than anyone else .
You don &apos;t want this , do you ?
Tom isn &apos;t asleep .
Everybody loves him .
I want you to read it .
Tom ate out .
My guess is that Tom is looking for you .
Tom might be late .
This isn &apos;t mine .
I &apos;m not sure that I can swim that far .
Tom closed his eyes again .
Tell me the reason why you married her .
Tom made a mistake .
This clock is broken .
We have to do it .
Tom closed his eyes and made a wish .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where to look .
Tom started to cry .
You &apos;ll do what you have to do .
Tom knew that Mary loved him .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re all here .
Tom barely speaks to me anymore .
I know where Tom will be three hours from now .
Is money important to you ?
We know what happened next .
Isn &apos;t Tom cute ?
We haven &apos;t heard from Tom in a long time .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to read this if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Why should I care about Tom ?
The hat is yours .
You can &apos;t count on his help .
What did Tom do wrong ?
Why are you sleeping ?
Do you let your children play in the street ?
The train leaves in ten minutes .
Tom brought that .
It looks like Tom is confused .
He went into the bank .
Tom didn &apos;t think Mary would kiss him .
He worked hard .
We both know what you &apos;re doing .
They were surprised by what they saw .
I told Tom that I didn &apos;t like him .
I really appreciate your coming .
Tom could write his name when he was three years old .
Tom asked Mary to open the door for him .
Who has it ?
I don &apos;t know who you are .
I have a wife .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary has gone .
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary .
I hope that he will succeed .
Please take off your hat .
We drank a lot .
Tom says that he knows you .
I did it and I would do it again .
No one in the class runs as fast as he does .
I shouldn &apos;t have played outside in the rain .
We studied English .
Who saw me ?
Tom loves being around people .
If it sounds too good to be true , it probably isn &apos;t .
What &apos;s Tom wearing ?
What have you given me ?
What kind of person is she ?
People say that life is short .
We &apos;ve missed our train .
I can &apos;t speak Japanese .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me three hours ago ?
Tom can walk .
What do you think he said when I asked him for a favor ?
It was very cold yesterday morning .
Are you good at it ?
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ve ever told you , but you have beautiful eyes .
Tom says he &apos;s not guilty .
I bought a new television .
How is that possible ?
The baby is sleeping on the bed .
How did you two meet ?
I gave Tom a book .
I can &apos;t go any faster .
Tom says he &apos;s having trouble with his computer .
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute .
I can read your mind .
Tom speaks French better than any of the other students in his class .
We &apos;re new at this .
I &apos;m sure that wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s dog .
She still loves him .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is younger or older than he is .
I don &apos;t want to live with that .
I remember you . We met three years ago .
I &apos;m not tired .
I &apos;m feeling much better now .
It was my decision .
The last train has already gone .
We understand each other .
Tom stole my money .
Both Tom and Mary study French .
I &apos;m a good cook .
What do you mean , you can &apos;t help me ?
Look at that building .
Tom waited outside .
That &apos;s true too , isn &apos;t it ?
I wrote that book .
He stayed at a hotel for a couple of days .
I just had to see this for myself .
I &apos;m not proud of what I did .
What are they doing here ?
Don &apos;t you want to come along ?
This river is dangerous to swim in .
It &apos;s hot out here .
I &apos;ll do it , too .
Tom is mad at us .
Here &apos;s Tom .
Are they still here ?
Tom likes coffee without sugar .
Is it five already ?
Tom is taking care of it for us .
I thought you said you were alone .
Can you please help ?
Do you like this car ?
She let him drive on his own .
Tom didn &apos;t call Mary from Boston .
What did you get for Christmas this year ?
I saw nothing .
Do what your mother said .
Tom won &apos;t like that answer .
She is old .
Please give me another chance .
We miss you .
Ask me anything you want .
This is a very new book .
She thought of a good solution .
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework ?
I won &apos;t stand for it anymore .
I speak French .
What are you going to do about that ?
How &apos;s that again ?
He has a lot of books on history .
Tom found out the truth from Mary .
Tom promised me something would be done .
Don &apos;t be late to school again .
Give me that one .
Be careful what you do .
That &apos;s correct .
Do you want Tom ?
There &apos;s always a next time .
Will it rain tomorrow ?
Tom realized that he might be late .
My son is playing in the rain .
Those are good .
I hope that doesn &apos;t happen again .
I intend to do that by tomorrow .
Tom wants to be strong .
What &apos;s going on with kids these days ?
You are big .
I have a daughter .
I don &apos;t want to come to Boston .
I always have to wear a tie because of my job .
They &apos;re going .
You don &apos;t have to tell me that twice .
There &apos;s still a lot left .
Everybody knows that where I come from .
Can &apos;t you just ask Tom to help us ?
They have nothing in common .
Tom is the one , isn &apos;t he ?
What do you think about this ?
I love her so much I could die .
Tom was here today asking for help .
It kind of surprised me .
You had your sister really worried .
I could &apos;ve done that by myself .
You should stop that .
I think things are going well .
Did Tom do anything ?
Did you feed the dog ?
We need to win .
What &apos;s wrong with this ?
It is no joke .
Our parents are friends .
You &apos;re too drunk to drive .
I &apos;ll meet you back on the ship .
You may use his library .
I love them .
Tom and Mary hardly know each other .
She was feeling kind of tired .
He is not the boy who came here yesterday .
He suggested I go with him to the party .
Everything is expensive here .
This song sounds sad .
Tom is still very angry .
What do you think of Japan ?
I &apos;ve heard this story before .
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston ?
I don &apos;t want you to die .
Tom just doesn &apos;t want to hear this .
How do I do this ?
It &apos;s not your money that I want .
Tom was reading the newspaper .
Am I right ?
I &apos;m supposed to help Tom with his homework .
You said it !
People tell me I have a nice voice .
You don &apos;t have to hurry .
You wouldn &apos;t believe me if I told you .
Have you heard from Tom ?
Tom really does do that sometimes .
Where do you think it is ?
He is not angry anymore .
I &apos;m taking off now .
Take a break .
Tom wasn &apos;t always this way .
Do you want a lawyer ?
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t able to do anything .
What should I do ?
I watch TV now and then .
What were you doing that moment ?
I don &apos;t like baseball at all .
Tom told me his job was a lot of fun .
Tom and Mary are out .
You &apos;re probably right .
He bought a hat .
That &apos;s so sweet .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom .
We already know each other .
Tom took his time reading the contract .
I want a book .
I need to help Tom .
I think it &apos;s impossible for Tom .
My mother is seriously ill .
I &apos;m doing fine .
He looked pretty tired .
I should be at school .
I &apos;ll see you two later .
I had my brother clean my room .
Is Tom there alone ?
Why don &apos;t you come with me ?
I don &apos;t see what that has to do with this .
Tom knows where we are .
I need it by tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom dropped the children off at school .
Do you have any questions before we get started ?
Tom plays soccer .
You ought to write a book .
Why doesn &apos;t he come back ?
Tom asked Mary for her telephone number .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten all day .
His letter says he &apos;ll arrive next Sunday .
Tom drove to school .
It isn &apos;t like that .
How beautiful she is !
Thanks for helping .
I got up early in the morning .
It was yesterday that I met her .
I &apos;m studying English at home .
Tom is almost as tall as you are .
Did you hear what I said ?
I &apos;m a little confused .
Tom and Mary are happy .
She was busy .
What wasn &apos;t easy ?
He talks a lot about his father .
Tom liked Mary .
I asked him to wait here .
I think Tom isn &apos;t the right man for the job .
I have really bad eyes .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t drive so fast . You &apos;re making the baby sick !
He came home very late .
I don &apos;t know if it is good .
I want to visit Boston again .
It &apos;s still closed .
Tom said he didn &apos;t have much money on him .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether he can do it , but he &apos;ll give it a try .
Let &apos;s meet on Sunday .
You won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom loves his job .
You may speak to him .
Is Tom at school ?
I bought a book yesterday .
I forgot to buy a gift for you .
He has no friends to talk with .
That &apos;s a secret . I can &apos;t tell you .
I know my way around here .
They &apos;re not going to stop .
Why is it there ?
I like to study French .
I can &apos;t hear a thing .
Do you like music ?
Those who don &apos;t want to go , don &apos;t need to go .
Tom is about to do that .
I can &apos;t see Tom .
I came here to be alone .
The policeman said to the girls , &quot; Is this car yours ? &quot;
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle yet .
We need more sugar .
I don &apos;t want to die alone .
Tom isn &apos;t back yet .
You aren &apos;t here .
His name will soon be forgotten .
Would you explain what this is ?
We didn &apos;t see Tom .
We played soccer yesterday .
Tom asked a few questions that Mary didn &apos;t want to answer .
Where &apos;s my pizza ?
It &apos;s going to be great .
Tom seems to be waiting for somebody .
Do you know the answer ?
Is the coffee hot ?
There is a cat under the desk .
Everything is in place now .
No one saw Tom do that .
Why do you think they like it ?
I will do my best .
He need not have run so fast .
Most of them were university students .
Tom is getting married next month .
Tom ran out of food .
Are Tom and Mary with you ?
Are you in danger ?
Where did you leave your bike ?
What did you find ?
I take it you know Tom .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s such a good idea .
It looks like Tom decided to stay .
I didn &apos;t see anyone in the room but Tom .
She didn &apos;t read the book .
He can run fast .
She does talk a lot .
The house has been bought .
I only asked Tom to pay his bill .
You know I hate it .
I &apos;ll go home .
You take the money .
I will not see him any more .
It &apos;s going to stay that way .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is here .
We &apos;ll walk .
I don &apos;t like English .
Are we all ready ?
I walk my dog in the park every morning .
I know his name .
We were very busy last week .
You just have to know that it works . You don &apos;t need to know how it works .
You don &apos;t even know who I am , do you ?
I still want to talk to you .
I have to pay the bill .
That &apos;s what she said .
This book is easy for me to read .
May I help you ?
Do you believe me now ?
Tom gave me another chance .
Tom wants to talk to you again .
I wonder why Tom is sad .
Tom is going to be a father soon .
Tom got everything he wanted .
Nobody saw it coming .
Don &apos;t go back to sleep !
Tom wanted to learn .
Your wife says some strange things .
He came back two days later .
I love to read books .
We have to go now .
My heart hurts .
Do you want to take it ?
Tom already knows .
You didn &apos;t eat much lunch , did you ?
Tom is doing well .
I &apos;m absolutely sure !
Whose phone is that ?
This building is very large .
They will be safe with him .
I wish I could cook as well as my mother .
You should &apos;ve let us know you were coming .
I hope you &apos;re not mad at me .
I have an opinion .
He was kind enough to tell me the truth .
There are many people living in this house .
We want to love and be loved .
Let &apos;s not play .
May I have one of these ?
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow .
We meet here once a month .
Tom says he has to study French .
There is no choice in this matter .
You never say what you really think .
We know who did it .
How long is this ?
Would you like to sing ?
We ran out of money .
It almost sounds like you don &apos;t want to go .
Tom needs to stay where he is .
I &apos;m not to blame .
When are you free ?
Tom will probably pass the test .
I have to answer his letter .
She is eating .
I &apos;m going to write Tom a letter .
I believe that she has never told a lie .
Tom can come , too .
I admit that he is right .
Tom said something in French .
Tom works for Mary .
It &apos;s time to go home now .
I remember your face , but I don &apos;t remember your name .
The light is off .
They can &apos;t get out .
Tom is a very good friend of mine .
Are you quite sure about that ?
I &apos;m not going to lose .
I totally understand .
A young boy , who couldn &apos;t have been more than five years old , asked Tom how to get to the post office .
Tom says Mary likes you .
Tom had no money .
I hardly know anything about Australia .
Where are we now ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the piano .
I don &apos;t like people like Tom .
I &apos;m already married .
Please let me in .
This room is quiet .
I don &apos;t like this joke .
This is never going to end .
Let us do the work .
I was right behind Tom .
Tom knows what he has to do .
There you are .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think John was afraid .
Let me win for once .
I have to see this movie .
Don &apos;t you want to know what happened ?
I don &apos;t know whether he &apos;ll come by train or by car .
That &apos;s a good thing .
Which brother did you see ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s new or not .
Tom thought that Mary was lying .
She has done her homework .
You should &apos;ve told me sooner .
I &apos;m friends with him .
Tom hasn &apos;t decided yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t look too happy .
I &apos;m a bit confused .
Give me a little more water .
Do you want to use mine ?
I can &apos;t smoke .
Mary is young and beautiful .
You &apos;re not allowed to leave this room .
He called me a taxi .
Tom told Mary that he would do that .
This is your wine .
We want to leave .
Where &apos;s my room ?
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you sick ?
I told him to come .
Didn &apos;t anyone help you ?
You &apos;re not allowed to speak French here .
I wonder where Tom is now .
I don &apos;t drink a lot of beer .
We don &apos;t have that kind of money .
I won &apos;t be able to visit you tomorrow because I &apos;ll be busy .
Tom &apos;s room was very small .
Everyone looked at Tom .
I don &apos;t like to sit outside .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t talk to each other anymore .
I wouldn &apos;t mind a beer right now .
We should &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
Which one would you like ?
Tom doesn &apos;t talk .
We &apos;re going to try .
Tom is happy to be home .
Nobody can solve this problem .
Why didn &apos;t you do that ?
We &apos;ll never work for Tom .
Tell us what to do .
How do I get to the airport ?
Tom asked again .
Our team did very well .
This bird can &apos;t fly .
I haven &apos;t forgotten Tom .
It &apos;s hardly a secret .
Tom looked at Mary .
Do you think our team will win ?
You aren &apos;t Canadian .
Tom said that he thought Mary might need to do that today .
I made Tom do that .
Everyone knows us .
What &apos;ll you be doing ?
That &apos;s not going to be easy .
Is that what you want me to say ?
Tom worked on the job alone .
Tom drove Mary &apos;s car to Boston .
She went from one shop to another .
I can &apos;t get Tom to even talk to me .
Tom is sitting at the table over there .
I made the right decision .
Are you all alone ?
Will you wait for me ?
We &apos;re both named Tom .
This book isn &apos;t very good .
It &apos;s good to see you .
He did it not once , but twice .
His picture was in the newspaper .
I have just been to the airport to see my friend off .
Do they do that often ?
Don &apos;t ever talk to me again .
I think he is planning something .
This isn &apos;t about Tom , is it ?
This is what I want to do .
Could you call me tonight , please ?
I &apos;m really sorry everything happened the way it did .
I didn &apos;t understand anything .
I &apos;ve been waiting like a year for this .
Both my parents are at home now .
Tom looks different today .
I met him while he was in Japan .
I wish I had a dog .
He just arrived .
Tom liked to play in the snow .
Tom looks good , doesn &apos;t he ?
We &apos;ll come as soon as we can .
He has a kind heart .
He picked up the book .
I don &apos;t need this anymore .
Are we in the same hotel ?
I looked down .
Tom came on his own .
What does that say ?
Do you want to be rich ?
Tom hasn &apos;t been back here for years .
Are you sure Tom doesn &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
If I don &apos;t go , who will ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
Which one of those books did you give to Tom ?
Even a child knows that .
I &apos;ve got a message for you .
I don &apos;t think I like you .
Tom must be so scared .
I haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
Did Tom talk to Mary ?
She didn &apos;t tell me her secret .
I arrived here just now .
Tom told me his father had been killed in the war .
Why are we here ?
I called Tom today .
This book is popular with students .
I enjoy reading .
It &apos;ll soon be six o &apos;clock .
Tom left Australia three weeks ago .
You should come over after work .
Tom taught me .
I want to eat pizza .
Tom looks crazy .
What time is it now ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in a long time .
We &apos;re brothers .
She knows my wife .
Tom was also on the bus .
She loves her children .
Are you injured ?
Most of them were college students .
Her old cat is still alive .
I broke up with her .
I don &apos;t like it any more than you do .
Can you tell me what this is ?
We learn to read and write in school .
I don &apos;t know what the question means .
It was quiet again .
Do whatever you have to do .
He advised us against doing it .
You must be careful .
Will Tom be here this afternoon ?
I told Tom why I wanted to do that .
Tom is heavy .
This isn &apos;t about Tom .
When I got back , I found my car missing .
I bought a pair of shoes .
She wasn &apos;t able to meet him .
I was very hungry .
Were they here ?
Tom didn &apos;t know this .
I want more .
Tom is ready .
We have only two dollars .
Tom was with me .
Tom kissed you , didn &apos;t he ?
That was really interesting .
Is your car new ?
I &apos;m used to this kind of work .
You should know it .
Tom and Mary sat on the couch together .
Would you like some coffee or something ?
Everybody loves Tom .
Tom also speaks a little French .
Tom helped out .
Tom said that he couldn &apos;t swim well .
Thank you for coming .
I guess they really weren &apos;t all that busy .
I could see Tom was still alive .
What &apos;s it look like to you ?
He wasn &apos;t even there .
We &apos;re finished here .
She came alone .
I do that , too .
It happened to someone I know .
We became very good friends .
I remember reading this book .
I feel worse today than I did yesterday .
Is Tom big ?
I was talking about it last night .
Did Tom say why he wasn &apos;t coming ?
I don &apos;t want to wait until tomorrow .
What &apos;s Tom found ?
You &apos;re very good .
Tom is looking for Mary now .
Would you join me for a walk ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come .
You have a beautiful house .
I can eat anything .
Tom didn &apos;t go to Boston .
Do you think Tom &apos;s telling the truth ?
Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to .
It &apos;s difficult to help people who don &apos;t want your help .
I never thought it could happen to me .
I &apos;m on my break .
Tom is feeling a little better today .
I cannot put up with this noise .
I &apos;ll meet him tomorrow .
Tom isn &apos;t going to do that again .
I knew Tom was different .
Where is Tom &apos;s classroom ?
Do come to the party .
I &apos;d rather not go there alone .
Are you mad at me ?
They went away .
It &apos;s up to you to decide what to do .
We know it was you that killed Tom .
I was at work .
I don &apos;t think Tom speaks French .
Tom likes Mary , you know ?
Tom got very lucky .
Please translate this .
Tom , how &apos;s it going ?
I haven &apos;t eaten in three days .
They want to see you .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know each other .
That &apos;s my mother .
Is it cold outside ?
You &apos;ll see it again .
Tom is willing to try anything .
I don &apos;t know how I did it .
Tom isn &apos;t done .
Aren &apos;t you going to bed ?
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary .
I haven &apos;t got all day .
She raised her hand .
There &apos;s a restaurant here .
You should not have done that . It was wrong .
My mother loves music .
I wanted to have lunch with Tom tomorrow , but he told me he &apos;d be out of town .
I &apos;m not a baby anymore .
I really want to know what &apos;s going on here .
I don &apos;t know which to choose .
Do you have a bicycle ?
Tom won &apos;t let Mary in .
I always do that .
I want to take you with me .
Nobody saw anything .
I couldn &apos;t attend that party because I was sick .
Tom lied about his age , so Mary thought he was much older than he really was .
I &apos;ve been reading that book all afternoon .
Why do you think we &apos;re here ?
I don &apos;t want to be your friend .
I haven &apos;t read the book you &apos;re talking about .
How do you go to school ?
I would like to visit Boston .
I &apos;ll be late to work .
Are you alone right now ?
Are you for or against the proposal ?
Did you like Tom ?
He seldom gets angry .
She spoke to him about the matter .
Maybe you &apos;ll succeed .
If I were rich , I would do so . As it is , I can do nothing .
Look around you .
He looked around , but he saw no one .
They know that .
When exactly did you see Tom ?
I need a little more time .
He will wait .
Tom said to ask you .
Tom has some advice for us .
Can we go over there ?
Have you arrived at a decision yet ?
Everyone says that he &apos;s a good man .
Do you have a solution ?
That girl looks like Mary .
Tom has three kids now .
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes ?
Let me say one thing .
We don &apos;t do that as often as we used to .
Tom has already finished breakfast .
I &apos;m doing this for him .
I knew you would understand .
I agreed with Tom .
Tom and I are well .
I can not afford to keep a car .
How hungry are you , Tom ?
The idea is not bad .
Why don &apos;t you want to live in Boston ?
Tom likes to listen to music while he &apos;s doing his homework .
I studied for a year in Boston .
Tom stood behind me .
This doesn &apos;t mean a thing to me .
Tom has made a lot of new friends .
I &apos;d like to be alone .
I had no idea where I was .
We came to see you .
All I can do is to do my best .
All my friends like Tom .
Tom put Mary to bed .
They don &apos;t get it .
I &apos;m hungry , so I &apos;m going to get something to eat .
Come back in an hour .
Everybody came to the class on time .
We can &apos;t help you .
You &apos;d love Tom .
Do you know what time they came ?
Tom &apos;s home .
I hate when this happens .
You wouldn &apos;t have won without me .
He asked me where she lived .
We used to spend hours there .
You can &apos;t change Tom .
They don &apos;t like my friends .
I don &apos;t hate you .
Tom met Mary at the top of the stairs .
Your plan seems better than mine .
How old is your father ?
I could not get out .
I can &apos;t wait for him any longer .
Did Tom pay , too ?
This is where my father works .
It &apos;s the only one in the world .
Tom is drunk .
Tom was looking at you .
Tom might need to help Mary .
I think Tom could do that .
We were happy .
Did Tom know ?
Does it hurt a lot ?
I started working .
Tom put away his clothes .
I promised to send Tom a letter .
They may be playing in the park .
Tom makes more money than Mary does .
Were you looking for Tom ?
It didn &apos;t end well .
Where are you going with those ?
I want to show Tom around town .
Tom will be back in three hours .
Tom is thirty , but he looks much younger .
I am poor at swimming .
Today is Tom &apos;s birthday .
I didn &apos;t even ask .
You are old enough to know this .
Tom is helping his wife .
She is in need of help .
You aren &apos;t any better than me .
You &apos;re a woman now .
There &apos;s nothing more I can tell you .
Tom won &apos;t speak French anymore .
That &apos;s what I thought you said .
How do you use this camera ?
Have you been to Boston before ?
I thought Tom was dead .
What &apos;re you going to do with that ?
I have Tom &apos;s keys .
I can &apos;t work for you anymore .
I shouldn &apos;t have gone to Boston without you .
Tom has decided not to go to the meeting .
He &apos;s my brother .
Tom wanted to go to the beach .
Would you like to watch a movie ?
I didn &apos;t understand your question .
Tom is driving his car .
I don &apos;t want to be friends with Tom .
I &apos;m so proud of Tom .
When did you become friends ?
The question was too difficult to answer .
Come here soon .
We &apos;ll have to leave town .
I should &apos;ve listened to what my mother said .
You don &apos;t know my dad , do you ?
Have you told Tom &apos;s mother ?
That &apos;s where I live .
Tom is strong , but Mary isn &apos;t .
You must not stay in bed .
Is the bank far from here ?
I think Tom knew Mary .
I think that he wants to buy a new dictionary .
Tom seems as busy as ever .
Don &apos;t shut your eyes .
He &apos;s smart .
No one loves you as much as I do .
All of my friends like soccer .
I don &apos;t know whether I should believe Tom or not .
Tom was worried sick .
Tom wanted to write something .
You can &apos;t go where I &apos;m going .
I think I made a difference .
Just listening to that song makes me think of you .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever wait for anyone .
What do you want with us ?
I can not answer your question .
You probably think Mary is cute .
I think that she &apos;s honest .
I never think about it anymore .
I spend money as soon as I get it .
Tom says he can &apos;t find his hat .
I mean it !
Take your time with it .
I have a right to be on this ship .
Tom and I walk to school together .
Tom has to do that .
I want to drive .
It is cold today .
My father gets up early .
I &apos;ll be here until next week .
This is way too dangerous for a child to play with .
It &apos;s hard to get people to change .
Tom has written to me .
Some children do not like vegetables .
Tom was speaking faster than usual .
We all make mistakes , right ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
What &apos;s your dad &apos;s name ?
It &apos;s all your fault .
I asked Tom to open the window .
We almost never eat out .
Tom didn &apos;t want it .
My dream came true .
Tom stayed there for three years .
Tom was here with Mary yesterday afternoon .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his glasses .
Tom was fast .
I go to work by bus .
I won &apos;t get the chance to do that again until next week .
Everybody is very busy .
He doesn &apos;t want to go to school today .
I want to be able to speak French .
Tom always makes the same mistakes .
Tom is not home right now .
My son won &apos;t listen to me .
I find it hard to believe .
Have you read the book Tom bought for you ?
You have to stop this .
Why did you start studying French ?
She &apos;s in the hospital now .
They live in a small house .
I know the area .
I never want to see you again .
I need some time to myself .
We are happy to see you .
I have a lot of books .
I don &apos;t want her .
This is not enough .
You can trust me .
There &apos;s too much salt in this soup .
We &apos;ll see to it .
I &apos;ll wait for a week .
How stupid he is !
I prefer fish to meat .
If Tom goes , I will , too .
It &apos;s well worth the trouble .
What &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
He has stayed at the hotel for five days .
The room was dark and cold .
If I get rich , I will buy it .
What makes people happy ?
Maybe Tom killed himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t like being told he &apos;s not old enough yet .
Tom has bought a new car .
What I think doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;m going to do that again .
Tom wanted to be a doctor .
Tom is very young .
Tom couldn &apos;t speak .
Tom is going to thank me .
I &apos;m sick of English .
Are you through with the paper ?
I was the one that was right all along .
He is watching TV now .
Don &apos;t they have anyone to look after them ?
Can you give me your phone number ?
Tom likes to talk about himself .
It &apos;s a beautiful song .
Tom says he &apos;s not happy here .
I have three friends who can speak French .
Why are we even talking about this ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston .
Tom taught himself how to do that .
I kind of liked Tom .
The week is finally over .
You must keep your hands clean .
Today I &apos;m working at home .
Tom said he thinks you &apos;re stupid .
Please buy a few apples .
What is this girl &apos;s name ?
Tom has known Mary for a long time .
I &apos;m ready for anything .
You &apos;ll need more .
Was it just a game to you ?
I go to Boston three times a year .
He is thirty years old .
Will you come back tomorrow ?
Why aren &apos;t you home ?
Come home at six .
I &apos;ll work as long as I live .
Tom knows it &apos;s true .
She always speaks English .
Don &apos;t you have any friends ?
Tom looks exactly like his brother .
I &apos;m busy , so I can &apos;t go .
I will go out when I have finished this work .
I know Tom very well .
Tom is going to like those .
Tom is always telling Mary that he loves her .
We need that money .
I can tell you where to find Tom .
Tom looked good .
If you want , I can show you how to do that .
My mother took me to the park .
You don &apos;t want me here , do you ?
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten anything all day .
Do you think Tom knows what happened ?
Will Tom die ?
English is not difficult to learn .
Tom likes his new car .
Tom saw Mary on TV .
I &apos;ll get to it .
She is two years older than you .
I don &apos;t feel like going out for a walk .
The dictionary is on the desk .
I asked Tom to open the door .
That is his house .
I &apos;m taking the day off .
Those are their books .
He seems ill .
It &apos;s all up to you .
Tom lives in Boston .
We should &apos;ve stayed home with Tom .
I didn &apos;t know she was ill .
Look out of the window .
Tom was sure that he would never see her again .
We all knew about it .
Tom always does his best .
Can you tell me your address ?
I like being on the team .
The boy made his parents happy .
When did it first start to happen ?
Both of my sisters are married .
Tom takes a bus to work .
Let me help you .
Tom wasn &apos;t told why Mary wasn &apos;t there .
Tom is coming to get you .
Tom said he wants to do everything by himself .
Which do you prefer , tea or coffee ?
He visited his uncle yesterday .
Which beer is yours ?
I thought I told you not to do that .
Don &apos;t talk about work . We &apos;re on vacation .
Tom &apos;ll change .
I &apos;m looking for an old man .
My hands were full .
I have a new bicycle .
Tom is only a few years older than me .
Not all men are like that .
I didn &apos;t eat anything for six days .
Do you believe what he said ?
We aren &apos;t where we are supposed to be .
What are you people thinking ?
Do you think that &apos;s wrong ?
You don &apos;t look happy to see me .
I bought an umbrella .
Tom called again .
Tom has not yet been told of his father &apos;s death .
I am busy .
People often tell me more than I want to know .
He &apos;s not allowed to leave the country .
I wrote a long letter to her .
You may use this car .
Tom knew Mary was probably not going to be able to do that .
Why &apos;s Tom afraid of you ?
Tom always looked busy , but never was .
Tom needs your help .
Tom never made it home .
He arrived after I had left .
How many hours did you work this week ?
I wanted to talk with you .
What do you want here ?
Tom seems fine .
I don &apos;t yet have a present for Tom .
Who are you talking to ?
Tom kept quiet .
Tom is going to like me .
I still don &apos;t believe it .
Do you think Tom is still interested ?
You &apos;re in danger , Tom .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know Mary could speak French .
What do you do in Boston ?
We have no time to waste .
Don &apos;t you feel cold ?
There &apos;s something I have to know .
He loves her , but she doesn &apos;t like him .
Tom is still here .
Let &apos;s go by bus .
I &apos;d like to study in Paris .
I saw Tom again last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a lot to give .
Why don &apos;t you come over to my house for dinner tomorrow ?
How long does it take to get to the station ?
I have something else to do .
He &apos;s always been living in Tokyo .
Thanks to your help , I could understand the book quite well .
He is strong as a horse .
I did no such thing .
I want to be here with you .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to do that ?
Your French is really quite good .
I must catch the first train .
Tom doesn &apos;t take his job very seriously .
We have had a lot of rain this summer .
I stayed so he wouldn &apos;t feel lonely .
Tom was surprised .
There is only one book on the desk .
Tom and I played tennis all day .
Tom knows what this is .
Tom didn &apos;t think Mary would enjoy his party .
I feel like I &apos;m thirty years old .
It &apos;s hard .
He promised not to tell that to anyone .
Tom is hard to please .
Where were you ?
She was very surprised when she heard the news .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how it happened .
She used to live near him .
Tom is quite stupid .
He didn &apos;t say anything .
Today you turn four years old .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like it .
I am calling my father .
I asked him to help me .
She put her glasses back on .
I have no idea what &apos;s going on here .
Tom really does hate dogs .
I &apos;ve made a mistake .
Tom was hungry .
I &apos;m not that old .
He was very nervous .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to play outside today .
I &apos;m more afraid of them than I am of you .
I think we need those .
Tom thought it was easy .
Tom and Mary were watching television when I got home .
He was lucky .
I have a son not much older than you .
You have to speak French here .
He speaks ten languages .
Tom speaks French better than English .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom can do that or not .
Tom will spend tomorrow here .
Tom seemed really impressed with Mary &apos;s speech .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I spoke to Tom .
It &apos;s every man for himself .
Tom speaks French as well as you .
I can &apos;t read yet .
Tom dropped in to see us .
I don &apos;t want to study French .
We &apos;ve never been to Boston .
Tom had to go there .
I always try to tell the truth .
Are we done yet ?
I would &apos;ve sent Tom money .
I &apos;ve eaten a great deal of food this week .
You can &apos;t have understood what he said .
I need someone who I can talk to .
Here &apos;s what we don &apos;t know .
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
Don &apos;t leave the bicycle in the rain .
Tom never said that .
Are you free ?
My clothes are over there .
Tom and I are happy .
Something happened .
Don &apos;t make fun of Tom .
It &apos;s a present for you .
You may ask me any question you want .
He doesn &apos;t understand you .
Tom is a very good friend .
It &apos;s no secret that Tom doesn &apos;t agree with you .
How long were you gone ?
I will speak to him alone .
Tom and I want you to come .
You &apos;re a problem .
I don &apos;t know why we came here .
Nobody knows how I feel .
Tom is Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Let &apos;s meet again in October .
Tom no longer lives here .
They never found out the truth .
I caught two fish .
Tom said that he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
I don &apos;t care what the doctor says . I &apos;m going to eat whatever I want .
He hates her parents .
Tom said he isn &apos;t happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as carefully as I do .
You must know yourself .
Tom likes learning French .
They wouldn &apos;t have done anything .
Tom thought about Mary a lot .
Why didn &apos;t you just leave ?
Tom can &apos;t win and he knows it .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know what happened .
I opened the door .
If we &apos;d gotten here sooner , we might &apos;ve been able to save Tom .
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston .
How many apples do you want ?
Tell your friends .
Everybody is alive .
I don &apos;t have to go , but you do .
Tom comes to Boston once a year .
I think I &apos;ve heard that somewhere before .
You can &apos;t see my house from here .
Everyone &apos;s happy again .
Will you hold this seat for me ?
We &apos;re so happy for you .
I &apos;m leaving today .
He has a bicycle .
I was just going to leave home .
You ought to do it at once .
I feel like taking a walk .
Did I miss something this morning ?
Tom laughed at himself .
Tom might not be as hungry as you think he is .
I knew you &apos;d understand .
Tom was kind enough to show me the way to the station .
Maybe you can &apos;t hear me .
I wish I had a brother .
If you wish to speak to Tom , you &apos;ll need to wait about three hours .
Take mine .
She was too proud to ask him for help .
I don &apos;t go to school .
I &apos;ve been looking for you .
That sounds beautiful .
I always drink milk with my breakfast .
I like this cup .
That &apos;s what Tom thought .
If you don &apos;t know , who does ?
That &apos;s what women want .
We aren &apos;t married .
I see you &apos;re at it again .
The door would not open .
I came as soon as I heard that you needed me .
We just can &apos;t stand each other .
How did you get to know Mary ?
We &apos;re in Boston .
Tom gave Mary a book .
Have you forgotten about me ?
That &apos;s exactly what Tom is doing .
Are you American ?
I &apos;m really bad at doing stuff like this .
I invited him over to my place .
Are you sure Tom was the one who did this ?
I &apos;ve been writing letters .
Please don &apos;t ask me to do this again .
Tom doesn &apos;t look rich to me .
Tom is in Mary &apos;s office .
It is their only choice .
We did all we could do .
Tom should be home by 2 : 30 .
Tom was happy .
You didn &apos;t try hard enough .
Why are you sorry for something you haven &apos;t done ?
Tom caught a fish .
I ran away .
Tom doesn &apos;t love me anymore .
His house is easy to find .
Tom said he &apos;d be right back .
I &apos;m not doing this for you .
He tried hard , but failed .
Your daughter is not a child anymore .
I know Tom pretty well .
I got up at six .
I like it in Boston .
I wrote down his phone number .
I have some things I need to tell you .
Tom is helping his mother in the kitchen .
How are we going to pay for that ?
What time is it over there ?
Are they gone ?
They must be happy .
How many boys are there in this class ?
How long do I have to stay in the hospital ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to talk to John .
Tom and I are afraid .
Tom gave Mary a piece of his mind .
Tom has already had lunch .
I thought about you .
Tom , can I have a moment with you alone ?
Do you know whether she can speak English ?
I don &apos;t think we can trust Tom as much as we used to .
He died doing what he loved .
I was never in love with Tom .
Mary and Alice are like sisters .
What &apos;s it like ?
They &apos;re our brothers .
I don &apos;t think Tom is coming .
Tom kept me waiting for more than 30 minutes .
Let &apos;s take a bus .
I have to get back to work .
I &apos;ve got a feeling Tom doesn &apos;t really know how to speak French .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that tomorrow .
You &apos;re right , as usual .
I knew you &apos;d come after me .
I don &apos;t have that .
He is anything but a fool .
Why should that be necessary ?
It is the in thing to do .
Stop singing .
I don &apos;t know either of them .
She heard him sing .
Tom is a little taller than you are .
I now know it &apos;s possible .
You &apos;d better not tell anyone .
Tom said he needed some more time .
That was a very good speech .
Tom felt very lonely .
I will quit smoking for good .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me ?
I &apos;m just too busy to take a vacation now .
Do you like tea or coffee ?
I &apos;m not Tom .
You should go home . It &apos;s getting late .
Tom and Mary are in the car waiting for us .
He agreed to what they said .
I &apos;m as old as you .
Tom is playing .
Tom opened his mouth .
Why should I wait ?
What does Tom know about me ?
I thought I saw something .
I don &apos;t believe anything Tom says .
Do they know about us ?
What &apos;s the time ?
I can &apos;t decide whether to go or not .
I think I can do it .
Tom always says no .
I don &apos;t know what they want .
Tom made me go there .
You can &apos;t drink the water here .
Tom wants to be in Boston .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
Tom kept his promise .
I have a feeling that he knows the secret .
I think you &apos;re going to like this movie .
If I knew anything , I &apos;d tell you .
No one likes to do that .
I wish that I could do more .
Tom is waiting to see what &apos;ll happen .
How many books do you think you &apos;ve read so far ?
You &apos;re kind of cute when you &apos;re mad .
Have you told Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing it that way ?
I almost forgot it .
Don &apos;t make fun of old people .
You need to go .
I called him up yesterday .
I agree completely .
You must go outside if you want to smoke .
I pretended that I didn &apos;t see it .
Let &apos;s do the homework together .
Tom couldn &apos;t run very fast .
When I was your age , I had a girlfriend .
Why isn &apos;t Tom at school ?
Leave him alone .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m asking you to do .
Tom is not happy with this .
I could eat a horse .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was already dead .
She didn &apos;t want to get involved .
Tom has given us all this .
Tom knew why Mary hit John .
Do you think it &apos;d be fun to do that ?
She liked talking about herself .
You forgot my birthday .
I don &apos;t think he will come .
The people in the other room are speaking French .
The woman has a little bit of fruit .
It was her that told me .
We don &apos;t know where to go .
What time are you coming back ?
Tom won &apos;t even look at me .
Did Tom kiss you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t come see us for Christmas , so we went to see him .
She told me not to go there alone .
Were you married to Tom ?
It &apos;s usually a good thing .
I said shut up !
Tom started dancing to the music .
Will you sell your house to him ?
You &apos;re doing fine .
Tom and Mary have been married for over 30 years .
I &apos;ve seen you somewhere before .
I just don &apos;t want to lose you .
You made it possible .
The work must be done by Tom .
Tom has been married a long time .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in over a week .
I &apos;d love to see this movie .
I know that was a mistake .
This coat is too short on me .
I love my wife .
The soup &apos;s very hot .
Tom will change .
Are you still thinking of going to college ?
Get away !
I don &apos;t know anyone here , except for Tom .
I might as well do it now .
I don &apos;t know what happened to you .
It &apos;s not as easy as you think .
Don &apos;t bother to answer this letter .
Tom read about Mary &apos;s accident in the newspaper .
I have to know why .
I &apos;m not rich , but not poor either .
Tom would like to know why you did that .
I &apos;m not sure I can believe that .
They were sick .
I tried to convince Tom to come home .
Did they say why they couldn &apos;t pay their bill on time ?
My parents don &apos;t like my girlfriend . They think that she &apos;s not good enough for me .
I will never do it again .
Who &apos;s sick ?
Tom knows you .
Who do you think it is ?
I &apos;ll take it to Tom .
It &apos;s never going to happen .
I &apos;ll stay until tomorrow .
How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that ?
Do you want to live in Boston ?
Why did Tom do this ?
Would you like to see Tom ?
I still love Mary .
I think Tom is the only one here who knows where Mary lives .
Tom didn &apos;t even look up .
Do you want to have some coffee ?
Tom showed Mary something .
I &apos;ll go if you go .
This one &apos;s my room , Tom .
She got him to do anything she wanted him to do .
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one .
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d help her , but he didn &apos;t .
Tom seemed convinced that Mary had to do that .
Tom and Mary are in Tom &apos;s car .
You must not be late for school .
I think you &apos;re going to make it .
He found a nice apartment for Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t know exactly what it was that Mary wanted him to do .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , but Mary is .
You can say that again .
Tom said it wasn &apos;t necessary .
I never hit Tom .
Tom has a lot of money , but he has no friends .
Tom stopped eating .
Tom has at least three children .
Tom had never been late for work before .
I haven &apos;t even told my wife .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference to me whether Tom comes or not .
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday .
I know why you aren &apos;t happy here .
Tom can &apos;t work tonight .
I wonder if he &apos;ll come tonight .
There &apos;s still time .
They want to know what &apos;s going on .
I need some time alone .
Don &apos;t you have school today ?
The bus will be here in a few minutes .
What &apos;s in your suitcase ?
I &apos;m reading this book .
Did I do that ?
The ship will arrive by five o &apos;clock .
Do you plan to go abroad ?
Do you think Tom knows Mary is married ?
She has flowers in her hand .
Tom wants to wait .
Tom works every day except Sunday .
I know what you were doing .
Everybody wanted me to do it .
Tom is already here , but Mary isn &apos;t here yet .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop .
I am very sorry for what I said .
Let &apos;s wait till he comes back .
What did you eat when you were in Australia ?
Tom tried to make Mary happy .
Do you want me to believe that ?
I love watching golf .
They didn &apos;t even know who they were supposed to meet .
She has been dead for ten years .
We cannot afford it .
Just take my word for it .
They &apos;re looking for you .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom .
This problem is not so difficult that you can &apos;t solve it .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen the picture yet .
When I want to cry , I think of you .
Do you want to be my friend ?
I want to know who you are .
When will this be returned to me ?
We &apos;re having a lot of fun .
Mary is not my sister .
I visited the village where he was born .
I can &apos;t believe I won .
I want to ask you some questions .
Is your school far away from your house ?
Do you know what happened ?
You can use my car if you like .
You know me well enough to know I wouldn &apos;t do that .
My whole family &apos;s from Boston .
I wanted to go somewhere I &apos;d never been before .
I cannot afford to buy such a thing .
I have to be home for dinner .
Tom lives alone .
I did Tom a favor .
Tom stayed behind to help Mary .
Just try it .
You should try to learn a little French .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom .
You were the one who told me it was safe here .
Tom got stood up .
I &apos;m going on vacation next week .
I hate the winter .
The doctor advised that she stay at home .
You are absolutely correct .
No one is listening to you .
Tom knows that Mary kissed John .
Tom will never understand .
Tom can read well .
It is time for her to go home .
Tom never got better .
My father has never gotten sick in his life .
Do you want any of these flowers ?
I don &apos;t know who can do that and who can &apos;t .
Tom is looking for his keys .
What do you think she is doing now ?
I can &apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been there .
Tom is bad .
Tom has gone mad .
You know where I &apos;ll be .
How can we save Tom ?
I &apos;ve been waiting here for him since this morning .
I put my hat on .
You &apos;re going to do great .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about music .
You &apos;ll find a job .
Call them this evening .
We aren &apos;t afraid of death .
You can learn as much in the library as in school .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday next week .
Who stood ?
We &apos;re not young anymore .
What color do you like ?
I &apos;m happy with what I have .
He might have missed the last train .
My father died when I was three .
I think you &apos;ve asked enough questions .
Tom is interested .
I &apos;m not as stupid as you think I am .
Why don &apos;t you try and get some sleep ?
Are they students ?
We &apos;ll have to live with that .
This book is not as easy as that one .
I &apos;ll come back tomorrow .
I asked Tom why .
We found them here .
Do you think it &apos;ll be that easy ?
Tom decided to do his best .
Why don &apos;t we talk in your office ?
Where is the cat ?
I stopped smoking once and for all .
May I have a glass of wine , please ?
We were just about to start eating .
It may be that he likes his job .
As far as I know , they are still together .
He seldom , if ever , goes to church .
I went to the airport by taxi .
How far is it to New York ?
Tom isn &apos;t himself today .
We must work hard .
I can sleep on the sofa .
Tom came to visit Mary .
We need to be very careful .
Is that not possible anymore ?
I have some friends in Australia .
You made too many mistakes .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t a student anymore .
What do you want to buy ?
I need sleep .
Where do we have to do that ?
She asked him for help .
I &apos;m afraid this key does not fit .
Tom is taking pictures .
We know each other .
A dog is a man &apos;s best friend .
Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
Tom seems a little nervous .
I &apos;m not hurt .
Tom had fun .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what I want to do .
I don &apos;t understand that question .
Tom &apos;ll lose .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry .
He asked me to wait there until he came back .
What do you want me to do with this ?
You must not do that anymore .
I have a few questions .
It &apos;s hard to speak French well .
They aren &apos;t stupid .
I can &apos;t stop Tom .
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this .
This song is very popular in Japan .
Where do I find that ?
Let &apos;s take a 10 minute break .
Tom went to Boston three years ago .
Why do you want to do this ?
Tom will be here for three days .
I &apos;ll do anything but that .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s job .
That &apos;s not love .
I wasn &apos;t the one who killed Tom .
I &apos;m very happy about it .
I had no idea you knew Tom .
Tom &apos;s family was also there .
Nobody answered the telephone .
Have you ever been on TV ?
Is Tom hot ?
How many pictures did you buy ?
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to see him to the door .
Tom spoke again .
Do you get paid for this ?
I missed the train .
What &apos;re you doing with my car ?
I saw her again .
I think you &apos;re the one who needs help .
He wants to go to the United States .
I tried everything to keep him alive .
All those things are true .
Tom heard Mary talk about John .
You made a mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t want to pay that much .
Are you sure you can afford this ?
You mean a lot to me .
He does this all the time .
That looks good .
Tom has stopped playing the piano .
I just started reading this book .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anyone here .
I met him on my way home from school .
Tom wants to drink a cup of coffee .
It is time to go to bed .
Tom is the one who told me that I should study French .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
Is it easy to get there ?
Tom is going to do this .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom didn &apos;t ask Mary to do anything .
I like this color as well .
Do your homework now .
These questions are easy to answer .
Tom probably won &apos;t come .
Why are you guys so angry ?
You can play outside if you want to .
How do you know what I said ?
I don &apos;t have a problem .
I was in the hospital last week .
I want us to be friends .
I &apos;m here because I want to be .
These things aren &apos;t mine !
Tom couldn &apos;t find a job .
All men must die .
Don &apos;t be afraid to make mistakes .
Everything &apos;s going to be fine .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d ever see you again .
You &apos;re welcome to stay with us as long as you want .
Where are those people from ?
Have you ever been to a foreign country ?
They were really cold .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
Is that all you want to say ?
I &apos;ll take him .
Tom looked busy .
Tom isn &apos;t very good at French .
All hope is gone .
Look at this large map of America .
Tom had another glass of wine .
Stop crying .
There isn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Do you have any apples ?
This is about all I can put up with .
We &apos;re studying French .
Tom can &apos;t handle it .
That &apos;s what made me happy .
I cannot read without glasses .
I know it isn &apos;t always easy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will visit Boston .
What do you call this in French ?
Do you think I should go alone ?
The door opened .
Tom was sitting on a bench .
Tom and I have written several books together .
She &apos;s wearing a hat .
I almost got hit by the ball .
She was ill for a long time .
Where would you like to go first ?
I got to know Tom when I was a college student .
We have fish for dinner today .
Tom picked up his hat and put it back on .
I &apos;ll get them for you .
These are great .
Is that really true ?
Don &apos;t make noise here .
I can &apos;t make a decision on my own .
Tom broke up with his girlfriend .
Please try to stay calm .
I &apos;ve seen enough .
I wanted to sell it .
Let &apos;s all go to Boston together .
Why were you looking for Tom ?
My father was never around .
He told us to keep quiet .
It &apos;s just a cat .
Tom walked into his apartment and closed the door behind him .
Tom &apos;s famous .
I work for a hospital .
Aren &apos;t you happy where you are ?
What will you do now ?
I &apos;ll take back what I said .
Did you get something to eat ?
We have a bit more work to do .
We only have one year to get this done .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only one who had a key .
I asked Tom to help .
He should thank you .
I could never be like you .
Tom loves to cook .
I &apos;m not saying this to hurt you , but it &apos;s the truth .
Where can one buy books ?
I am very dangerous .
When did you go to work ?
Tom is older than you think .
I &apos;ll see you at home .
I &apos;ll miss you , too .
I have seen him many times .
I can &apos;t wait that long .
What a small world !
Tom isn &apos;t just my boss . He &apos;s my friend , too .
How long &apos;s this going to take ?
Tom may change his mind later .
Tom is going to stay in Australia until the end of October .
I only think of you .
I wish I could go to Japan .
Tom isn &apos;t scared .
Tom has a very beautiful daughter .
He made me do it .
They don &apos;t know what they should do with the money .
Tom kept playing .
Tom lives here .
Tom lived there .
Tom and I want to see you .
Why are you so good at cooking ?
Why is Tom not here ?
I will go to America tomorrow .
I like coffee better .
My father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
Mary doesn &apos;t look like her mother .
I &apos;ve never played golf .
Will you go in place of me ?
What makes you think I &apos;ll like it ?
Where were you yesterday at 2 : 30 ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s father .
You may not smoke in this room .
They love that .
Tom is very sorry .
It &apos;ll happen .
You must stop him .
I ate lunch with Tom .
They feel hungry .
Tom was lonely .
Are you sure about this , Tom ?
I think he has done it .
It &apos;s so sweet .
No one knew who he was .
Tom has left the building .
You can &apos;t see Tom today .
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom wants to learn how to swim .
You &apos;re not supposed to be here .
We have enough time .
Tom came to ask us to help him .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes you .
You look like you &apos;ve just lost your best friend .
Tom isn &apos;t going to sing .
That was Tom &apos;s fault .
Tom is a high school student .
I love what I &apos;m doing here .
She goes to school by bus .
That &apos;s new .
The choice is yours .
What time do you go home ?
Tom is very good at it .
Why did you say such a thing ?
I hardly understood anything at all .
Tom is younger than me by three years .
This is our car .
Tom doesn &apos;t care what people think about him .
What &apos;ll you have ?
I really am very busy .
I don &apos;t know if Tom still lives in Australia .
I &apos;m so sorry to hear that .
I know you &apos;re happy about that .
I told Tom Mary was OK .
Tom almost smiled .
Those are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom and Mary met in Boston three years ago .
You &apos;ll feel at home .
Tom and I were both right .
May I look at your passport ?
I went over to where Tom was .
Do you have any good books for children to read ?
Tom has to study hard .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to talk to me .
You know who I mean .
Let me talk .
Tom still goes to school .
Tom saw them .
Your plan is a good one .
It &apos;s been raining since morning .
Have you told your parents ?
What &apos;s your opinion about that ?
Tom usually gets to work at least thirty minutes early .
I made this for you .
I was told that I should see a doctor .
Everybody has left except Tom and Mary .
These must be Tom &apos;s .
Tom knows where I live .
Tom has friends all over the world .
Do you know that hotel ?
Tom told me that Mary was good at playing the piano , but I didn &apos;t really believe him until I heard her play .
If there &apos;s anything you want to do , you should do it if you can .
We still need your help .
I never played golf .
Tom has never been in trouble in his life .
I think I see the problem .
You look like Tom .
I have to ask Tom a question .
Tom knew that he &apos;d have to tell Mary the truth .
October is over .
Did Tom say who did it ?
Is this Tom &apos;s bike ?
Tom asked for my number .
Tom had an accident .
I wonder what I &apos;ll find in the box .
You &apos;re just making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
Which book is better ?
I understand now why he didn &apos;t go to a university .
She used to be a teacher .
She was sitting under a tree .
Where would you like to go ?
Tom has to do that tomorrow .
It doesn &apos;t mean anything .
Tom does everything he &apos;s told .
This won &apos;t be easy .
Let Tom buy what he wants .
Why won &apos;t Tom help us ?
Tom likes to drive fast .
I &apos;m not tired at all .
You know almost everything about me .
She is already married .
She paid me a visit yesterday .
We like it .
I gave Tom my word .
He is kind .
He looked as if he had been ill .
Where is your money ?
I wish I had more time .
That car is mine .
I wonder why she didn &apos;t tell him about it .
We won &apos;t be back here again until next year .
Come along with us .
We &apos;re going to do what Tom said we should do .
Tom knows what Mary said .
We &apos;re not giving up .
I love you and I don &apos;t want anything bad to happen to you .
Tom has already seen it .
Nobody noticed Tom leave the room .
Are you sure about this ?
Tom went there alone .
I don &apos;t want meat .
What do you mean by it ?
Everyone knows me .
Tom is rich enough to buy whatever he wants .
They know you .
Tom was too tired to do anything .
I actually don &apos;t work here .
Tom would like to have a girlfriend .
I have to study .
Tom spoke French better than I expected .
Bring your children with you .
May I come , too ?
Tom hasn &apos;t done what he was supposed to do .
I met him .
We can help Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t promise me anything .
Tom wasn &apos;t very happy .
We still haven &apos;t made a decision .
Do you really live alone ?
Do you think Tom was confused ?
Tom took a day off .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;s honest .
You almost killed me .
I &apos;m not going to do that again .
I went to bed early .
She pretended not to hear him .
That &apos;s simple .
Are these yours , Tom ?
You can &apos;t understand this sentence , can you ?
Bring me today &apos;s paper .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
I have a few things to finish up before I go home .
It &apos;s up to you to decide whether we &apos;ll go there or not .
Did you find your keys ?
They &apos;re all dead .
That doesn &apos;t sound stupid to me .
Tom was surprised the police knew his name .
Don &apos;t you like apples ?
Tom will probably be right .
Where are you going to study ?
Look , I know what I saw .
Do you remember what you said to me ?
All we need is a little more time .
Tom is never getting out of prison .
I am really sorry to hear that .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me that you knew each other ?
It looks like we have everything .
I should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
Tom is learning French .
Can the report be true ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of you .
You look very pretty today .
I don &apos;t have time for boys .
I hate Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
This is all your fault .
I had my pocket picked in the train .
He is now almost as tall as his father .
What I want to know is why .
Tom is careful about what he eats and drinks .
I think I had better not say anything about it .
I &apos;m not your father .
Tom was supposed to meet me here .
Tom and Mary are John &apos;s children .
Nobody here does that .
We &apos;ve come to get you .
It won &apos;t happen to me .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s father .
I &apos;m late .
No one believed him .
The noise kept me awake all night .
Do you want to see more ?
Do you know my father ?
He drank a bottle of wine .
Tom wasn &apos;t as busy as Mary .
Where does Tom live now ?
Please speak French .
They get along great .
Can you give me a hand with this table ?
She has been busy since yesterday .
Tom never got married .
I knew what Tom meant .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t mind .
He is as tall as his father .
How long has Tom been studying French ?
How much money do I owe you ?
He &apos;s innocent .
I was very scared .
I don &apos;t like your hat .
What &apos;s wrong , Tom ? We &apos;ve always been able to talk about this kind of thing before .
Tom is up there waiting for you .
I have a bit of bad news .
Tom isn &apos;t busy today .
Yesterday , I bought a book .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do it .
No one likes me .
He is eating .
Tom doesn &apos;t have his phone on him .
Tom doesn &apos;t want one .
I have been here for two years .
You &apos;re welcome .
He is nice to me .
Did she say that ?
I can &apos;t keep my eyes off of it .
That tree looks dead .
Tom doesn &apos;t write to me anymore .
Is there life before death ?
My younger brother is watching TV .
Don &apos;t laugh .
He didn &apos;t want to get in trouble .
The only girl Tom ever really liked was Mary .
We don &apos;t need these things .
I &apos;m proud of myself .
Tom sat down again .
Tom is looking for advice .
I &apos;ve known Tom ever since he was a child .
Tom looked around for his camera .
Can I use your dictionary ?
We &apos;re just here to help .
Look at the flowers in the park .
You &apos;re not rich , are you ?
It &apos;s very kind of you to say so .
I know you .
I bought a few eggs and a little milk .
Tom was lucky that he didn &apos;t get killed .
I know how difficult this must be for you .
She gave it to him .
A cat has seven lives .
I think we should do some more .
She agreed with him .
I fell in love with her at first sight .
It &apos;s all in here .
Tom is coming to dinner this evening .
I don &apos;t think anyone was here yesterday .
I &apos;d never do anything like that .
Tom is now staying in Boston .
I &apos;m proud to have you on our team .
I think I remember how to do that .
I need you to leave now .
I have to go there .
She made a good speech .
Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
Tom is the only one who can save the world .
He lost a book .
You have to start .
Who told you I was talking about you ?
Tom went to Boston by bus .
We are too drunk .
Tom called home .
I need somebody .
She can &apos;t have written it herself .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
He wouldn &apos;t believe us .
What do you do with your money ?
What should I have done in that situation ?
I have to pass this exam .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
I returned from abroad .
I just want this to never happen again .
Today is hot enough for us to swim in the sea .
I didn &apos;t ask Tom to go there .
We don &apos;t live in Boston .
I &apos;m sorry . I really have to go .
Where are your kids ?
They are about the same age .
Did you finish your homework ?
He doesn &apos;t remember anything .
Tom was here with Mary .
She &apos;s not as tall as him .
I &apos;m glad I don &apos;t have to do that anymore .
I could &apos;ve died .
Here I come .
Where is my office ?
Tom put some sugar and milk in his tea .
She will have to cook for everyone .
Tom will be so happy .
The cat was on the table .
You aren &apos;t supposed to swim here .
A few days later , he came .
I go to school on foot .
Tom is probably not hungry right now .
Why are you going ?
Who did it ?
We watch television every evening .
They all knew .
I don &apos;t want to stop .
I bought that book for Tom .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember .
Do you like rain ?
Tom told Mary the whole story .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you and Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t like being poor .
Is the water cold ?
Tom was about thirty when he moved to Boston .
He had dinner by himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t think about others .
Be careful not to make any mistakes .
He gave me a cold .
I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
Where are the other guys ?
I &apos;m sorry about what I said .
I sat down next to him .
Tom slept all day .
Do you want to go out ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Boston ?
She doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
I like Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t angry .
Why do you care what other people think ?
The morning is just a few hours away .
I found the book by chance .
I can &apos;t work like this .
She did not say anything .
Do you have rice ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
Tom &apos;s not sick .
I have an idea where to start .
You can &apos;t leave this room .
That &apos;s the way it works .
Tom is kind of tall .
I &apos;m very glad to be here .
Who wrote this story ?
I won &apos;t dance .
This story cannot be true .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t want this .
Tom plays tennis every day .
Please don &apos;t make so much noise .
It &apos;s your turn to read .
You &apos;re not Tom &apos;s type .
I just went home without saying anything .
Please give me some more coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know .
I don &apos;t want to talk to Tom .
Is that your house ?
This is the office in which he works .
Tom is much better at French than me .
I don &apos;t want to live alone .
Tom will never love you .
There &apos;s nothing left to worry about .
My father can swim , but my mother can &apos;t .
Tom was very rich .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying .
You know what I &apos;m doing .
Tom has a plan .
Could you translate this sentence ?
I &apos;m going to go to the movies .
Why do you want to go ?
Why do they do that ?
He was sound asleep .
I &apos;ve got to do this now .
Tom has nothing else to do .
You look just like your older brother .
I &apos;ve never loved you .
I &apos;ve never been this busy before .
He pretended not to be listening .
We &apos;re going to try to be there on time .
I don &apos;t believe a word you say .
I look forward to seeing you again .
Please put your shoes on .
Tom was one of us .
Tom said you might be interested in this book .
Tom bought something for Mary .
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary can .
My sister showed a new watch to me .
How can you be so calm ?
Do you know what that means ?
In October , I was in Boston .
We didn &apos;t try .
You won &apos;t find anything here .
I &apos;ll never be like Tom .
I &apos;m not busy .
The children were sitting on the floor in front of Tom .
He bought himself a dog .
Do you know who killed Tom ?
I know Tom better than anybody else does .
Tom is getting better .
Tom suggested we do that tomorrow .
Tom isn &apos;t sleeping .
My parents and I aren &apos;t close .
I said I &apos;ll do it .
She means nothing to him .
&quot; Are you hungry ? &quot; &quot; No , not really . &quot;
I know that all of this is just a game .
My foot &apos;s asleep again !
How come you know French so well ?
How do you like my new hat ?
Her hands were as cold as ice .
Tom may have won .
No one knows what to say .
I gave her her dictionary back .
He is reading a book in his room .
Tom got to work later than usual this morning . I wonder why .
Tom said he was asked to leave .
What are you going to give Tom ?
Tom only saw Mary once .
I consider Tom a friend .
Tom still has many things to do .
I &apos;m always busy with my homework .
Maybe it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
How often do you wash your clothes ?
It &apos;s raining .
I regret that decision .
I do not know when she can come .
I &apos;ve known you for years .
I find it hard to understand Tom .
Are you one of Tom &apos;s children ?
I can &apos;t remember the last time I saw you so happy .
What happened in the park ?
Everyone does it .
You won &apos;t be disappointed .
He will be very busy next month .
Can we get this over with , please ?
Tom &apos;s not in a good mood .
Mary and I are getting married .
There were only a few days left before Christmas .
Your story is hard to believe .
Do you want me to do it ?
My car has broken down .
I immediately started crying .
I &apos;ve got a lot of things to do this week .
Where &apos;s my phone ?
Can anyone answer my question ?
I live near here .
We probably don &apos;t have enough time to finish doing that today .
The house where Tom lives is in the old part of the city .
French is difficult .
I have been married for ten years .
I can &apos;t see a thing .
She has a book .
No one knows we &apos;re here .
Don &apos;t worry about it . It &apos;s not your problem .
She needs to help him .
I don &apos;t have a sister .
They don &apos;t know who I am .
I don &apos;t understand the question .
I have a good opinion of this novel .
What day is it today ?
We have everything .
I understand that .
They don &apos;t talk to me anymore .
He couldn &apos;t take it any longer .
Tom is almost always at home .
I can &apos;t let anyone stop me .
Tom knows Mary doesn &apos;t like it .
They should know it .
I have to go home .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
Don &apos;t tell anyone I was here .
I &apos;m supposed to be working this afternoon .
Tom wasn &apos;t feeling well .
Everybody &apos;s still there .
The room is full of flowers .
I &apos;m going to Boston to see Tom .
I wasn &apos;t surprised Tom didn &apos;t have to do the same thing that I had to do .
I haven &apos;t heard that word in a long time .
He will come .
Did you remember to buy sugar ?
What goes on in this room ?
I &apos;ve been telling you that for years .
She loves coffee .
Tom has never told anyone .
It would have been nice if Tom had listened to what I said more carefully .
I &apos;ve got a message for you from Tom .
We &apos;re OK .
My father drives to work .
I know no one in this city .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll like that .
Your daughter is very pretty .
You can &apos;t fire me .
I went for a drive in the country .
Tom talks fast .
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten yet .
She is kind to him .
Are you going to be there ?
I need a lot of them .
We &apos;ve made it .
They &apos;ll find Tom .
Tom arrived in Boston less than three weeks ago .
Tom has many friends to help him .
Tom has been waiting for Mary all morning , but she still hasn &apos;t come .
There are people who talk just because they have a mouth .
There is a bottle of wine on the table .
Tom isn &apos;t at home .
I have a feeling it &apos;s not going to be that easy .
He has a car .
Tom says Mary doesn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting so long .
Do you even know where the school is ?
He can only speak a little English .
You stole the money , didn &apos;t you ?
Is it for here ?
What do we owe ?
I love that dress .
I &apos;d have done it myself if I &apos;d had more time .
Not only his son , but his daughter is also famous .
I &apos;m better than him .
She plays tennis in the morning .
I &apos;m not coming with you .
Tom can &apos;t believe how stupid Mary is .
She &apos;s at home taking care of the kids .
Tom cried for help .
What do you want to say ?
I &apos;ve been here for three months .
It &apos;s going to stop raining soon .
Is that a new dress ?
Are you happy with your new car ?
Have you seen enough ?
Tom got into the car and drove off .
I don &apos;t usually wait for anybody .
I know I probably won &apos;t win .
Could you explain it to me again ?
This isn &apos;t money .
You were right about everything .
She advised him to go by bicycle .
I &apos;m very glad to hear the news .
Perhaps Tom would enjoy doing that .
It was getting dark .
Tom knows he &apos;s not supposed to help Mary do that .
Is Tom going to do that ?
Tom is going to be pleased to see you .
I like snow .
I like to play the piano .
Tom was planning on doing that tomorrow .
I feel guilty about having told a lie .
What do we have ?
He has only six months to live .
It &apos;s not a big deal .
That is really good news .
Tom has already eaten dinner .
&quot; I thought you liked him . &quot; &quot; I do . &quot;
She tried it herself .
Go on , Tom , I &apos;m listening .
I will explain it to him .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
I know what Tom knows .
Some people like summer , and others like winter .
Nobody loves me .
Tom is quite busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I have a book .
There goes our bus .
Tom pretended that he was a doctor .
They must have known it all along .
She goes to school on foot .
What do you want to do with your life ?
He &apos;s a friend from work .
How &apos;s the weather there ?
We all know that no one is perfect .
Have you guys seen the news ?
Tom and Mary were married .
When was the last time you saw your children ?
Are you still married to Tom ?
That wouldn &apos;t be good .
I wish I could have gone with her .
This umbrella looks a lot like mine .
I thought Tom might be sick .
You need to learn to listen to our advice .
I don &apos;t need anybody .
She seems to be happy .
Tom knows not to do that .
I have to speak with Tom .
Tom played tennis yesterday .
Would you like to go to the movies with me ?
That color doesn &apos;t look good on me .
I &apos;ll be in my office all afternoon .
How far away do you think that ship is ?
The light suddenly went out .
We don &apos;t want this one .
I &apos;m not nervous .
Tom lives across the street .
Has the movie started yet ?
I didn &apos;t look at Tom .
You have everything .
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t hurt .
I was just confused .
He asked a question about it .
We need Tom .
I knew Tom had something to do with it .
I thought that Tom was in Boston .
I want to see your mother .
Tom wants me to be his girlfriend .
She hardly ever works .
Don &apos;t forget we have to do our homework .
Tom can also speak a little French .
My wife and kids were there .
We &apos;ll see you when we get home .
I didn &apos;t sleep at all last night .
I &apos;ve never been so tired .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom to do that ?
Tom , here &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
They &apos;re doing great .
I like this dog .
I can &apos;t stay for dinner .
How far is it to the airport ?
I have many books .
I &apos;ll think about it .
He was married to her sister .
Tom made these for you .
What are you two doing here ?
No one works there anymore .
I &apos;d like to see my son .
Where &apos;s the money ?
Come to my house this afternoon .
What do you think you &apos;re doing ?
Tom was in bed with a cold .
Why are you going out ?
She likes walking alone .
Tom says I look like a girl .
What do you do after school ?
Can I go to the movies tomorrow ?
I wonder what it means .
Tom said that he &apos;d had nothing to do with what had happened .
I &apos;d like to know why you did it .
We don &apos;t get out much .
Tom no longer loves Mary .
Give me a piece of paper .
It has Tom &apos;s name on it .
Tom doesn &apos;t like living in Boston .
Don &apos;t even get me started .
Tom came back soon .
He arrived too early .
That &apos;s a pretty dress .
I &apos;m going to take this .
We &apos;ll miss Tom .
Look at us .
Tom will get married next month .
We could do our homework together .
That bicycle is mine .
My father has made me what I am .
Tom can say &quot; I can only speak French &quot; in thirty languages .
I gave up smoking six months ago .
You are good .
We &apos;re trying .
We knew this .
Tom is often absent .
No one &apos;s going to see me .
Tom and John are Mary &apos;s brothers . Alice is her sister .
All of us know him well .
I &apos;ll give you this book .
The river is five feet deep .
Tom said that he needs to learn how to do that .
John met Mary on his way to school .
This morning the weather was so bad that I had to take a taxi .
That could happen to anyone .
I &apos;ll be going .
We were both hungry .
We should go this way .
All Tom can think about is food .
Please don &apos;t speak so fast .
I &apos;m glad Tom has gone .
He &apos;s living from hand to mouth .
Tom is almost always home .
You must learn French .
They &apos;re playing together .
Let &apos;s meet at 6 : 30 .
I was able to convince Tom , but I wasn &apos;t able to convince Mary .
Don &apos;t say it again .
They understood each other .
Was that you in the car ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know the reason why Mary is absent .
I &apos;m not always busy .
He can &apos;t buy himself a car .
When will he come ?
It is necessary for you to start at once .
He speaks broken French .
Don &apos;t make me say it .
It &apos;s dark outside .
I would do it if I had more time on my hands .
I want you to want me .
He is free from care .
I don &apos;t know where Tom and Mary met .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
Why are you asking ?
His car is two years old .
I drank too much beer yesterday .
This book is too difficult for me to read .
It &apos;s a secret , I guess .
I &apos;ve got some good news .
Those things happen .
He took a day off .
I don &apos;t care about Tom .
I don &apos;t like school .
You look like a boy .
I need to learn French .
I &apos;m trying to help you .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that woman .
Tom asked Mary to meet him at John &apos;s house at 2 : 30 .
How are you doing , Tom ?
What &apos;ll Tom do with it ?
Is it true that you can &apos;t swim ?
You can go home now if you like .
What &apos;ll Tom do ?
It &apos;s been three years since the accident .
Tom went abroad .
What do they want us to do ?
What &apos;s on ?
This isn &apos;t for you , Tom .
We shouldn &apos;t have told Tom .
Tom went to see Mary in Boston .
I am playing in the park .
Do you think that Tom and Mary are going to get back together ?
Tom knows what Mary is thinking .
She did her best to help him .
Who kissed Tom ?
I know that already .
She can &apos;t be over thirty .
Tom didn &apos;t have to ask me twice .
I quit smoking .
I didn &apos;t know Tom then .
If you really want to speak to me , it &apos;s now or never .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d do that .
Are you hot ?
He said nothing , which made her angry .
Are you still hungry ?
Tom &apos;s office is very different from mine .
There &apos;s no wind today .
It works .
He gets around a lot .
When I &apos;m home alone , the house is too quiet .
He needs money .
I don &apos;t mind standing .
I had lunch with Tom .
The door was hard to open .
Do you know where Tom is taking us ?
Tom knew something .
Tom needs more .
This is the one I &apos;ll use .
You don &apos;t have to use a dictionary when you read this book .
I was disappointed because you weren &apos;t at home .
It &apos;s a good school .
This is a lot more fun than studying .
Is he Japanese ?
I don &apos;t feel like doing that now .
How does this work exactly ?
Tom said he thought I was dead .
Tom put on his glasses and opened the book .
They will agree on that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play golf .
Tell me what I need to do .
Everybody needs one .
I can &apos;t eat or drink very hot things .
She did it all by herself .
That &apos;s what Tom said this morning .
We plan on staying a week .
Where &apos;s our car ?
I was planning on telling you .
He likes taking a walk by himself .
I want to be able to read French .
This isn &apos;t French .
Tom will do it when he comes in .
That should be kept between us .
Do you know how old I am ?
I don &apos;t know why he said that to me .
I was on the bus .
Tom often drives his father &apos;s car .
That wasn &apos;t real .
I &apos;m still angry .
Tom and Mary are planning to come next year .
I heard you laughing .
Take as many as you want .
The weather is beautiful today .
I &apos;ll be done in an hour .
I do love you .
Do you have any plans for the weekend ?
I need your advice .
It &apos;s really dark here . I can &apos;t see anything .
I &apos;ll hurry .
That does sound fun .
Why is your mouth so big ?
Tom knows who Mary is .
Did Tom ever talk about his father ?
Tom took the day off .
Don &apos;t worry too much about that .
I want very much for you to understand .
I wish I could help you .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished his lunch yet .
He slept in the car .
Tom saw her .
I &apos;m very hot .
We were all disappointed by the game .
What did you do yesterday evening ?
Tom likes to do that .
I don &apos;t like doing that when it &apos;s raining .
Your mother would have been very proud of you .
He has changed .
Give me that .
Is he afraid of death ?
Tell me what you know .
He worked through the night .
Tom and Mary are completely against it .
Tom asked Mary if she knew John .
I can &apos;t put up with him .
There &apos;s nothing in this box .
The book was better than the movie .
He stood up .
No one seems to have any idea where Tom is .
Does anyone still do that ?
Come on , it &apos;s easy .
Let &apos;s speak in English .
We aren &apos;t children .
Why don &apos;t you like Tom ?
He is as poor as ever .
What are you guys going to do today ?
She didn &apos;t try to translate the letter .
She went with him to the movies .
Tom hasn &apos;t called yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary , but I like her .
I wish she would stop smoking .
It &apos;s very hard getting a taxi in this city .
I wasn &apos;t expecting you until tomorrow .
I &apos;m glad that I still live here .
I can see it in your eyes .
You both love each other , don &apos;t you ?
Could you do that tomorrow ?
He didn &apos;t speak to me at all .
That is no business of his .
What a beautiful night !
What has he done ?
Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell anyone .
I like reading books .
He bought it for five dollars .
She heard him cry .
I never actually wanted to do that .
They &apos;ll understand that .
Please don &apos;t be sad any more .
Do whatever needs to be done .
You &apos;re like a father to me .
I &apos;ll be lonely after you &apos;ve gone .
This train leaves at nine o &apos;clock .
Tom looked at his dog .
I &apos;m about to take Tom home .
Tom said you stole my money .
Which would you rather have , tea or coffee ?
She had no way to know about it .
Don &apos;t take Tom too seriously .
You guys are dangerous .
Tom wants to go home .
Why don &apos;t we call it a night ?
I have no idea what Tom will say .
Who stopped ?
I &apos;m disappointed and angry .
She did it carefully .
You ought to have seen it .
I know what you &apos;re going to ask .
I couldn &apos;t get hold of him at his office .
When I got out of bed , the sun was already high in the sky .
I already tried that .
Tom made himself something to eat .
I am married and have two children .
We can &apos;t go there .
Tom wants to know how long we &apos;re going to be here .
You can &apos;t go home now .
Here are the rules .
Where is the bank ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I know .
Tom and Mary work well together .
I thought you said you were bad at French .
I &apos;d like you to stop .
Tom likes being at home .
I thought you said we could go anywhere we wanted .
We &apos;re back where we started .
How did all this come about ?
Our school is right near the park .
Go with Tom .
I knew Tom was busy .
This book is interesting .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see you .
Tom must be Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
I &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
Tom got sick .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to me .
Please close the door behind you .
Tell me what I need to know .
I thought Tom was ready .
Let &apos;s always be friends .
Give me a chance to explain .
I &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
They &apos;ve taken Tom .
All you have to do is to do your best .
Perhaps he knows this story .
I have never been to the States .
Do you really not remember me ?
He is in love with her .
You have my word .
Tom was worried .
You need to tell me the truth .
I had help .
Just let Tom go .
I &apos;m sorry it worked out this way .
Tom walked over to where Mary was sitting .
How old is this TV ?
She takes after her mother in every respect .
He &apos;s too young to understand .
No one can tell .
The old man was loved by everyone .
Tom asked us to help him .
Tom only thinks about money .
Tom may do that again .
I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s going to rain today .
Tom enjoyed himself at the concert .
Tom knows I can &apos;t speak French very well .
I gave the books to this student .
Does Tom know how to cook ?
I got here as soon as I heard you needed me .
I worry about my future .
I wonder why she is so worried .
I love what I &apos;m doing .
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their son .
We expect a lot from him .
I must learn Japanese .
Why does Tom want to be a teacher ?
I heard that Tom is going to play tennis with us this afternoon .
I go to school at seven o &apos;clock .
Tom did a lot more than that .
Thank you for coming with me .
Where are you hiding ?
The money is on the table .
We really don &apos;t have time .
What else did Tom want ?
She stood up .
He happened to be there .
Tom plays the piano .
I &apos;ll give you whatever you want .
Tom and Mary often eat dinner together .
Tom didn &apos;t get it either .
What else did you do there ?
The question is whether he can do it or not .
I think you &apos;ll really enjoy reading this book .
That makes a difference , doesn &apos;t it ?
You should have come earlier .
He often appears on TV .
Tom came to my office today .
He was busy , but he took the time to show me around the city .
That is going too far .
I used to live there .
I wish Tom were my younger brother .
I &apos;m the only one who stayed awake all night .
How do you like Australia ?
Her story can &apos;t be true .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet been found .
I know Boston very well .
I &apos;m sure you already know what to do .
I really don &apos;t want to live here .
We may as well wait .
Tom made a big mistake .
He is the last man to do such a thing .
Tom looks very good .
I &apos;ll try .
Tom doesn &apos;t help me .
I went to the beach yesterday .
I can &apos;t find Tom either .
You alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
He put in a good word for me .
I thought Tom was in love with Mary .
How long have you known her ?
I have finished .
Tom stayed in Boston until October .
You never actually did that , did you ?
Tom asked us not to make any noise .
How do you know that &apos;s where Tom is now ?
I &apos;m sorry I kept you waiting .
Do you know what these are ?
Tom seems pleased .
Those aren &apos;t my rules . They &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
Tom seemed to be telling the truth .
Tom is reading a book .
Let &apos;s not tell anybody until next Monday .
She &apos;s been in the hospital for a month .
Why are you down here ?
You can &apos;t expect Tom to care about it the way you do .
They &apos;ll be looking for Tom .
The book is on the table .
Tom says he knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
I wish I could figure out how to get Tom to like me .
He never saw his sister again .
What &apos;re you doing out here ?
Thanks for staying with me .
How do I do it ?
Tom is now almost as tall as his father is .
He seems to have been ill for a long time .
We have a big problem .
Tom should &apos;ve come sooner .
This has been a long week .
I &apos;ll go back to Boston .
Tom will do that , I &apos;m pretty sure .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with Tom .
It is not funny at all .
I had to go to work .
She is as beautiful as her mother .
I &apos;m for that .
I was in the hospital a few days ago .
I can &apos;t do this either .
I &apos;m not feeling too well .
Are you finished with your work ?
Here &apos;s a picture of me .
Tom wanted to know everything about you .
I will tell the woman what I know .
This is the house where my uncle lives .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was in Boston the same time we were .
There is a television in my room .
I don &apos;t remember anything .
She never told me .
We get paid better than a lot of people do .
I read the letter to him .
That isn &apos;t Tom .
How many people do you see ?
What &apos;s this got to do with Tom ?
She isn &apos;t young .
You &apos;re very quiet today .
Why don &apos;t you come over here ?
We are coming .
You &apos;re not bad at this .
Everyone around the area works hard .
Tom looks after his mother .
You look very good .
That &apos;s really good news .
We really had nothing to lose .
What do I know ?
The two women know each other .
Where do you think Tom is ?
I think I &apos;m going to go home .
Tom said he didn &apos;t feel like talking to Mary .
She has gone to Paris .
Tom made dinner .
Tom told Mary that she could do whatever she wanted to do .
Here &apos;s the bill .
Have you eaten lunch ?
Tom wasn &apos;t in the office .
You don &apos;t have to go to school today .
I know that .
Why did you say such a thing to him ?
Tom still wants to come .
He was better than I expected .
He arrived late .
I always have time for you .
You made a good decision .
What &apos;s your favorite car ?
Tom had to go there by himself .
I think it &apos;s sad to have no friends .
I don &apos;t have enough .
I didn &apos;t think we were going to make it .
I couldn &apos;t help but feel disappointed when I heard the news .
We can &apos;t leave Boston until we finish this job .
This is very interesting .
You &apos;re wanted by the police .
Don &apos;t look down .
I ran into an old friend .
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us .
I don &apos;t remember what I wanted .
It &apos;s that important .
I have already finished reading this book .
You &apos;ll be fine .
Tom has a brother in Boston .
I can understand what she is saying .
Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
Tom wants to study music .
Tom came at me with a knife in his hand .
Tom looks young for his age .
It looks like Tom is afraid .
I wouldn &apos;t mind a cup of coffee .
I &apos;m not feeling very hungry right now .
I love that book .
Why don &apos;t I take this one ?
I &apos;m not married yet .
Where do you live now ?
How can this be ?
I &apos;d like to know what you think .
French is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
I think I found a problem .
I &apos;m trying to talk to you .
I live in this hotel .
Were you really in Australia ?
I cannot bear the pain any more .
Tom doesn &apos;t do anything .
I made these for you .
Could you drive Tom home ?
Is that a new shirt ?
Tom is sure to come .
Who is taller , Tom or Mary ?
I would like to see my father .
You killed Tom .
I don &apos;t think that would be a good idea .
You will soon get well .
Tom must be about thirty .
This coat is warm .
Tom promised that he wouldn &apos;t say anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s supposed to do .
When do you study ?
I just need five minutes .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;ll be necessary .
Don &apos;t make a mistake .
This is a story about a cat .
Tom was in Australia last month .
I see something .
I haven &apos;t seen you in a long time .
I saw what I saw .
Tom is really busy .
Tom didn &apos;t mind living by himself .
Tom couldn &apos;t find his way back home .
Is that sweet ?
Tom won &apos;t do it .
I had to walk home .
Tom sat down next to his daughter .
Tom is from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I can do that if you let me .
How hard would it be to do that ?
Don &apos;t give me that .
Tom thinks it &apos;ll be OK .
I &apos;m going out with Mary .
Is that clock going ?
I know everything about Tom .
The dog walked across the street .
I don &apos;t like it .
This is a very good question .
There used to be a church here .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s family .
You &apos;d like Tom .
I &apos;m sad now .
She went there yesterday .
Tom has it .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s stuff ?
I want to do this .
I arrived in Tokyo yesterday .
I &apos;m not going to fire you .
They &apos;re expensive .
We are at school together .
Tom has a lot of pictures .
That &apos;s not how we think .
What was he up to ?
Tom said that wasn &apos;t the case .
No one can know everything .
I don &apos;t have anything to say to Tom .
You know what Tom said about Mary , don &apos;t you ?
The baby is called Tom .
Do you like the new school better ?
No one is listening to Tom .
I &apos;m of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher .
I did exactly what you told me to do .
Tom said that isn &apos;t the only reason .
You &apos;re not welcome here .
I guess I won &apos;t be seeing you again .
I &apos;ll never do that again .
It was from Tom .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t feel like drinking beer tonight .
I &apos;m tall .
He was listening to the music in his room .
If anyone can fix this , it &apos;s Tom .
I am no longer tired .
Could you please do me a favor ?
Are you saying this doesn &apos;t matter ?
Please tell me what I &apos;m doing wrong .
How &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
Are you my doctor ?
Tom usually only wears glasses when he &apos;s reading .
I learned a lot from Tom .
Nothing is what it seems .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us everything .
I &apos;m happy Tom is doing OK .
Do you talk to your cats ?
I &apos;m not as healthy as I used to be .
You have to stay in bed until next Monday .
I wrote him to ask why .
We will fix this .
Tom and I have both been to Boston .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s house .
Children should be allowed to be children .
She went on speaking .
How often do you read books ?
Tom is probably dead .
Is there a place I can smoke ?
I have to do my best .
The food at that restaurant wasn &apos;t all that great .
So many things have changed .
Tom drinks too much coffee .
It made Tom happy .
Tom and I don &apos;t talk much anymore .
Do it again !
Everyone &apos;s waiting .
Ask me anything !
This is the same hospital where Tom works .
I could &apos;ve met you at the airport .
I saw him wash the car .
I almost feel sorry for Tom .
The mother told her daughter to do it herself .
Tom married Mary last month .
You should not go alone .
It &apos;s going to take about an hour .
I like dogs , but my sister likes cats .
I &apos;m worried about what &apos;ll happen if Tom comes .
The room is empty .
That &apos;ll do it .
I can &apos;t stop you .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary very well .
Why don &apos;t you say it ?
You know where everything is .
How &apos;re you doing ?
I sat down .
What is the name of this river ?
Tom &apos;s father died before Tom was born .
The war was finally brought to a close .
I think you should think about the future .
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake .
Tom is doing well now .
Tom must not like Mary very much .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know that Mary could speak French .
His words hurt her feelings .
Tom isn &apos;t feeling well .
Tom goes to a different high school .
I &apos;d be happy here , I think .
He is often late for school .
We &apos;ll save a seat for you .
I really couldn &apos;t have done this without you .
Tom was afraid of what people would think .
I know something you don &apos;t .
He &apos;s feeling much better .
I understand everything .
What makes you ask that ?
You can &apos;t drink here .
I &apos;ve always wanted to do this .
They were in that room with me all night .
This isn &apos;t over yet .
Do you like China ?
We don &apos;t have room in our car for anyone else .
Tom convinced me that Mary was right .
This is the only thing that was left .
I saw Tom last night in the library .
Tom helped Mary fix her bicycle .
I couldn &apos;t call you . The telephone was out of order .
Tom will need my help .
I can &apos;t explain everything .
We were on the train for ten hours .
Tom will like that .
My mother is two years younger than my father .
I love working here .
My brother is older than me .
Do you enjoy studying French ?
Let &apos;s not forget that Tom doesn &apos;t understand French .
I &apos;m scared .
I &apos;m going to Boston with you .
What do you think this is ?
I want you to come with me .
What else do we have ?
I &apos;m still waiting for my money .
You &apos;re doing everything wrong .
I like speaking French .
What &apos;s this about ?
I lost face .
Tom is completely confused .
Tom told me I should spend more time with my family .
My sister was a beautiful woman .
I heard it on the radio .
Tom hasn &apos;t played tennis for a while .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan on being there .
Tom said he &apos;d call tomorrow .
They can &apos;t start without me .
Tom doesn &apos;t sleep here .
That didn &apos;t help them any .
I &apos;ve just eaten lunch .
A fire broke out during that night .
Is this your cat ?
What don &apos;t you have ?
It &apos;s simple .
I am studying very hard .
When can I see you ?
I wonder why Tom is alone .
I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
I love Tom .
Have you decided whether or not you &apos;re going to sell your house ?
There &apos;s a good chance that what Tom told you isn &apos;t true .
I like living with Tom .
People learn from experience .
I think I found something .
Perhaps I can help you .
I think you &apos;re going to like this one .
I see how dangerous it is .
What would you like to eat ?
It was rather funny .
Do you want this ?
What do you learn English for ?
Tom saw Mary driving her new car .
We &apos;ll deal with it later .
I &apos;d rather not eat now .
Tom isn &apos;t one of us .
Tell me the good news first .
I &apos;ve been waiting for Tom since 2 : 30 .
You were so good at tennis . Why did you give it up ?
Tom was out of town last week .
I did that because I wanted to .
The room was filled with people .
He thought the matter over for three days .
Who can tell what will happen in the future ?
Tom went to Boston a month ago .
How old are you now ?
You are not allowed to leave the room .
Tom , I want to go to sleep .
I think that we can do that .
He &apos;s old enough to be her father .
He has several men to work for him .
I want to go out with you .
Tom wasn &apos;t there either .
I don &apos;t speak any French .
Everyone felt sorry for Tom .
We can &apos;t help Tom .
Why do they want me ?
What should I tell Tom now ?
Tom called Mary up yesterday .
We &apos;ve got to do that on Monday .
No one ran ahead of him .
Tom broke up with Mary and has started going out Alice .
I &apos;ll come .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be as busy as Mary is .
Tom needs hope .
Don &apos;t go home .
I thought that Tom loved Mary .
It is a long story .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom shouldn &apos;t go there by himself .
He does not know how to drive a car .
Who asked you ?
Tom is lying in bed with a cold .
Tom asked for our help .
Tom is Mary &apos;s grandfather .
I went home by train .
Tom came up with a good solution .
Tom wrote down everything Mary said .
Are we ready ?
I don &apos;t know what has happened to him .
Where is the boy ?
Just act like nothing happened .
I don &apos;t want to do this .
We &apos;ve done everything we could .
It &apos;s not exactly a secret .
His parents took him for a walk .
There was nothing you could do about that .
We go to school by bus .
We &apos;re just friends .
Tom said something to Mary .
Do you accept my offer ?
The time will come when you will understand this .
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn &apos;t answer .
Can you put up with the noise ?
Tom would love to see this .
Look at me .
I got scared just like everybody else .
She doesn &apos;t do anything else .
I already have a girlfriend .
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2 : 30 .
I want to know who used to live here .
How long has this been going on ?
I don &apos;t have to do that .
This isn &apos;t a good time .
I didn &apos;t realize how hungry I was .
He wanted to buy the book .
His name is known to me .
There will always be things we &apos;ll never understand .
What is it that you need ?
Why don &apos;t you go with Tom ?
This isn &apos;t going to be good .
Tom always keeps his word .
Tom will take care of that for us .
I wish you had told me that .
How are things with you ?
Tom never told me about this .
Tell her to call me .
Tom lives really far from here .
I went home because it was late .
I can &apos;t see you .
If you don &apos;t go , I won &apos;t , either .
We &apos;re not home right now .
Can I help you with that ?
Who would have thought Tom would change ?
I don &apos;t have to listen to you .
This one &apos;s on me .
Tom is very interested in French .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t come today .
I always walk .
I can &apos;t leave Tom .
She &apos;s my wife .
You don &apos;t know my brother .
Is that true ?
What do we do with it ?
This is going to be long .
I often break things when I &apos;m angry .
The meeting will have finished by the time we get there .
How long have you known ?
Tom walked in and sat on the couch .
The meeting was almost over .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know you .
This is my grandmother .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone .
The children are crying again .
Please look after my cats while I &apos;m away .
If you want to be happy , then be happy .
That &apos;s what I like to do .
How much money does he have ?
I don &apos;t know how long I &apos;ll be gone .
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing before he goes home .
You don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m not angry anymore .
Tom and Mary both need new shoes .
I thought Tom would give Mary John &apos;s phone number .
We don &apos;t know what Tom took .
Tom had a little money .
Tom wants to make everyone happy .
Be a man .
Did you let Tom drive your car ?
Tom was outside .
I can &apos;t kiss you now .
I wonder what &apos;s wrong with the car .
I &apos;ve never heard my mother sing a song .
Where did everybody go ?
Did somebody hit Tom ?
Here &apos;s one for you .
Why do you want to see Tom ?
Where could they be ?
I only wish I &apos;d been able to do more for Tom .
You did it all right .
Tom can &apos;t work this evening .
I &apos;ll be waiting outside .
I have a brother who lives in Australia .
What does that do ?
I &apos;m afraid for his life .
What color is Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom wants to break up with Mary .
I said get out !
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary lives .
I have to be in Boston by Monday .
I didn &apos;t study at all .
It only happened once .
He took off his clothes .
We can &apos;t live like this .
I &apos;d like to see Tom again .
Tom wanted to see you .
Tom won &apos;t even talk to Mary anymore .
Everything will turn out fine .
You &apos;ll know soon enough .
Have you ever tried telling a joke in French ?
How exactly was Tom killed ?
I know that I was wrong .
Tom wasn &apos;t right .
Can you answer this question ?
I appreciate your coming all the way .
That &apos;s my sister &apos;s camera .
Nothing can be worse than that .
Get under my umbrella .
I need to go home .
That won &apos;t happen .
I believe the choice is clear .
I &apos;ve got no time for that .
Do you take work home with you ?
I am ready to die .
Tom seldom speaks to Mary anymore .
I remember writing to her .
Tom has a nice car , a nice home and a good job .
My children are in school .
Tom didn &apos;t know he &apos;d hurt anybody .
That suit you bought was a good choice .
I don &apos;t want to sit next to Tom tonight .
Do it yourself by all means .
Tom and I enjoy singing together .
I really don &apos;t think I can do that .
Tom already knows what Mary has done .
That wasn &apos;t Tom .
He finished reading the letter .
This dog isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s .
Tom told me that I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary .
He left the door open .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to make of this .
It gets quite cold in the winter .
Perhaps Tom can help you do that .
He took his coat off and set to work .
I bought every book on Japan I could find .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is happy .
What do you want for that ?
I &apos;d rather stay here .
I said I &apos;ll get it .
You &apos;re going to have to leave .
I go to the beach almost every day .
I love this one .
Tom will never tell us the truth .
Do you know where my glasses are ?
How do you think Tom will convince Mary to marry him ?
Where can I buy it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like you very much either .
Tom started doing that a week ago .
I &apos;m not convinced .
What do you have for breakfast ?
I wonder whether Tom is nervous .
You need to learn French .
I remember seeing her somewhere .
She is like a mother to me .
I &apos;m too busy to help you right now .
If you want to , we &apos;ll go .
Tom can &apos;t hurt you anymore .
Let me get right to the point .
I think you &apos;ve been here too long .
What is the matter with your car ?
Tom promised to write every day .
I want a room for tonight .
Take care of the kids for me .
I &apos;ve loved you since the day I first saw you .
I saw Tom on TV .
I spent a couple of months in Australia .
Did you live here before ?
I hope the bread keeps until tomorrow .
I don &apos;t want to stay here .
It keeps happening .
Tom had other things he needed to buy .
I won &apos;t forget .
It &apos;s what I do .
I just wanted to listen to some music .
You would have failed without his help .
That &apos;s what I like about you .
Why are the police here ?
Tom and Mary want to get married .
Tom is poor .
He smiled at me and got on the train .
Tom can &apos;t swim and Mary can &apos;t either .
I like that tie of yours .
&quot; When should we tell Tom this ? &quot; &quot; Now is the best time . &quot;
He hates himself .
My mother has four brothers .
Tom didn &apos;t say anything at all .
It &apos;s been five years since my father died .
Tom &apos;s making his bed .
That student is Tom .
Tom is a head taller than me .
We &apos;ll see each other tomorrow in the library .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
It &apos;s always been like that .
Tom just started .
He usually comes in time .
I will translate .
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s that simple .
What were Tom and Mary doing at John &apos;s house ?
I didn &apos;t catch what he said .
He often comes late .
Is this your glass or your sister &apos;s ?
I don &apos;t need anyone .
I was here first .
What were you doing when I called this morning ?
It &apos;s difficult for me to understand French when it &apos;s spoken quickly .
You &apos;re going to have to do it yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
He is playing golf .
You &apos;re here .
Tom has been getting up early .
I was so drunk last night .
He was angry with himself .
I do not feel sad .
Tom isn &apos;t sure yet .
Tom died a few days later .
Why not talk it over with your teacher ?
Please have a drink .
You know how important this job is to me , don &apos;t you ?
Are you saying you don &apos;t know ?
I bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit .
Did you go to school today ?
Can you read that ?
Do you know what they said ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell me who to give this to .
I think that I &apos;m going to have to tell Tom everything .
Why are you so tired ?
What are you guys doing ?
Do you want to know the truth ?
Has anything changed ?
Tom and Mary go to work every day on the same bus .
We study French together .
I know exactly where I am .
I guess I should &apos;ve known .
This is going to be fine .
I forgot Tom spoke French .
Do you have one ?
I don &apos;t know why my friend wants us to wait .
Where is the bus ?
Tom says he has something to show us .
Which is the best solution ?
I &apos;ll lend you this dictionary .
Did you get a beer ?
That has changed everything .
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn &apos;t like him .
I have everything here that I need .
My sister is famous .
I &apos;m not going to live here .
I &apos;m not going to say it again .
Tom , come here , I want you .
You &apos;re in love .
You &apos;ve got to see her home .
What was there ?
I think Tom did the best he could .
Tom &apos;ll pay .
It &apos;s a beautiful day outside .
I &apos;m not telling you .
I &apos;ll call you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand that at all .
I want to go there once again .
I &apos;ll ask Tom for you .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re doing .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d want to see me again .
I think that he is honest .
What about us ?
Tom would never do such a thing .
I don &apos;t know what to say .
Tom forgot my birthday .
He should have been a lawyer .
You like it , don &apos;t you ?
I think I made a mistake .
There was food enough for us all .
I &apos;m here because of you .
What are you doing up here ?
Tom is waiting there for you .
Tom wasn &apos;t lying .
I &apos;ve only spoken to Tom twice since he started working here .
That &apos;s interesting .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that again .
I came to Australia to try to find a job .
I feel so happy when I &apos;m with you .
I don &apos;t want Tom here .
You can &apos;t make everyone happy all the time .
They sell meat at this store .
I can &apos;t read French .
We &apos;ll dance .
Tom should work harder .
The train left before they got to the station .
Why do we have to do this ?
Tom didn &apos;t even know where he was .
It &apos;s important .
There was nothing for us to drink .
I knew this would happen .
I want us to be a family .
He &apos;s eating lunch now .
You broke my heart .
Which weekend in October are you planning to do that ?
Yesterday was my birthday .
Tom stopped here .
I have three times as many books as Tom .
Tom is standing right behind you .
Where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone ?
I will join you .
Tom will have to wait .
Which cat is yours ?
I &apos;m going to the hospital .
It was lucky Tom did that .
Tom knew that Mary was in danger .
Don &apos;t you want Tom to be happy ?
Tom should &apos;ve studied harder .
Tom is innocent .
You eat more food than I do .
Those are mine , I think .
I know the whole story .
You &apos;ll be on time , won &apos;t you ?
They &apos;re surprised .
I &apos;m the one who should be doing that .
You can &apos;t always do what you want .
I &apos;ll do that for Tom .
We &apos;re going .
What do you intend to do with the money ?
Tom said he didn &apos;t need our help .
Whose is that book ?
I can &apos;t picture Tom doing that .
I also like cake .
I can do it .
Whose fault is that ?
Have you ever tried to learn another language ?
Tom and Mary used to often do that together .
This machine is too heavy for me to carry .
The problem is that we don &apos;t have a lot of money .
I don &apos;t know who made the cake .
I bought some bread .
We are happy .
I still believe in love .
Tom asked Mary for an explanation .
I like doing that as well .
You &apos;re supposed to be working .
Tom wants to see that .
Can you wait a bit ?
You &apos;re so beautiful !
I don &apos;t even think about it anymore .
There were too many people there .
You have no right to be here .
What do you have ?
He can play tennis very well .
We both know what happened .
She looks young for her age .
I drank the coffee .
You &apos;ve been very good to me .
Tom could barely speak .
You were supposed to tell Tom that .
This book is better than any I have ever read .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to like this .
You don &apos;t have to thank me .
Are you sure this is what you want ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like speaking French .
We had no choice .
We have no reason for staying here .
What good &apos;s that going to do ?
The day turned out to be fine .
You should leave it for tomorrow .
He went to London two years ago .
You have work to do .
Tom likes to go to the beach .
Tom knew he &apos;d never see Mary again .
I waited all morning for that to happen .
I know what to study .
Why can &apos;t you come ?
I &apos;ve just finished doing that .
Don &apos;t let the dog out .
We &apos;ll tell Tom .
I love to see you laugh .
There seems to be a mistake .
I must finish my homework before dinner .
What were Tom and Mary supposed to do ?
I drink coffee after dinner .
Are you in a bad mood ?
What &apos;s happening ?
I think Tom is happy .
I &apos;ll have her come here .
I love your name .
You can &apos;t let anyone know I said that .
Tom stayed in the hotel .
Will you go with Tom ?
If you don &apos;t want to do this , you don &apos;t have to .
How did you get to know her ?
She invited me to her home .
We &apos;ll run in the park .
We are good friends .
Tom allowed Mary to play his guitar .
I know you &apos;re here .
Did you sleep enough last night ?
I believe Tom knows .
How many brothers do you have ?
Let us go home .
Tom won &apos;t succeed .
I &apos;d be quiet if I were you .
Why isn &apos;t Tom playing with us ?
When did you first meet him ?
You &apos;ll like it .
&quot; Where is my wife ? &quot; &quot; She is in jail . &quot;
He &apos;ll be in London about this time tomorrow .
I &apos;m older than your brother .
Be careful what you say and how you say it .
I don &apos;t know about things like that .
I wonder why Tom has been so nice to me recently .
She looks very happy .
Tom has decided to sell his car .
I &apos;ll take this umbrella .
I don &apos;t want to go to school .
I &apos;m going to show you something .
I &apos;m at school .
Do you think Tom knew about that ?
My father asked me to open the door .
Tom won &apos;t give up easily .
Why didn &apos;t anyone say anything ?
A few minutes after he finished his work , he went to bed .
If I had time , I would study French .
What are you doing ?
This isn &apos;t possible without Tom &apos;s help .
I never make my bed .
I found this book interesting from beginning to end .
It is not easy to be understood by everybody .
Isn &apos;t there anyone else who can help you ?
I never said I wasn &apos;t happy .
I want to study abroad next year .
We still love each other .
Tom dropped Mary off in front of John &apos;s .
There &apos;s nothing left for me here .
How is everyone ?
Some people like danger .
He came back at nine o &apos;clock .
Tom got drunk last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to lose Mary .
Tom is better than I am .
If necessary , I &apos;ll come at nine tomorrow .
I took the children to school .
I &apos;m going to wash my car .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know why Mary is scared of him .
They eat meat once a week .
I wish I could talk about it .
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to ?
Tom wanted to know more about Mary &apos;s family .
I don &apos;t know that yet .
They aren &apos;t like us .
Tom wants to become a doctor .
This joke doesn &apos;t have anything to do with you .
I thought you &apos;d decided against it .
I waited for her a long time .
Who &apos;s the girl at the door ?
I &apos;ve seen the picture before .
We &apos;ve got to help them .
So , you don &apos;t think I &apos;m good enough for you .
I know Tom isn &apos;t alone .
I &apos;ll try to do my best .
What do you think is down there ?
Why are you not satisfied ?
Tom showed Mary a picture of John and another boy .
Tom has three cats .
Tom asked Mary if she loved him .
Tom said he just needed more time .
I really don &apos;t know why I &apos;m so tired .
He was drunk on beer .
I can speak a little French .
I think Tom is sick .
Not everyone likes that book .
I thought you might want it .
Tom asked me if I was hungry .
It &apos;ll be a good day .
I &apos;m not like that .
Do you really think that &apos;s a good idea ?
The lady that is speaking to that boy is his teacher .
Tom said that he thought it could happen in Boston , too .
Tom was too fat .
I &apos;m not in Boston .
I enjoy your company .
Tom isn &apos;t here . He &apos;s already left .
Who did you have in mind ?
Tom can &apos;t stop it .
I &apos;m in love with Tom .
I can &apos;t go back there alone .
When do you plan to come to Boston ?
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone .
I don &apos;t know either .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom can afford it .
My father never talked about the war .
Tom used to play tennis three days a week .
I &apos;ll look it up .
Have you heard Tom &apos;s music ?
I &apos;ve done some things I &apos;m not proud of .
I wasn &apos;t talking about you .
I can &apos;t understand this business .
You should look into it .
You should &apos;ve let me help you .
I &apos;d like to go with you , but I &apos;m broke .
If you &apos;d prefer , we can speak French .
Tom may not be in Boston .
I &apos;m glad I was able to help you last week .
If we walk , we &apos;ll be very late .
Tom has been here three years .
I didn &apos;t go .
What &apos;s Tom writing ?
He is better off than before .
Bring the key .
I &apos;m doing what I want to do .
My parents don &apos;t like my girlfriend .
He is looking for a job .
When did you arrive ?
It is a book .
What am I to do ?
I want a television set , but I can &apos;t afford to buy one .
I saw you in the park yesterday .
Mary said that she wasn &apos;t Tom &apos;s daughter .
Tom and Mary understood each other .
Tom didn &apos;t buy it after all .
Give me the keys .
I was in Boston yesterday .
You have no choice in this matter .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
I hope Tom is alive .
We need to be more like Tom .
He promised not to tell .
I didn &apos;t know that she had a child .
I &apos;d like you to come at nine .
I &apos;m early .
I &apos;m working on it .
Everybody loves my cat .
I asked her to wait a moment .
I can &apos;t put up with it any longer .
He listened to the music with his eyes closed .
I know what I like .
I don &apos;t want Tom to think he has to help me .
I love you just the way you are .
He pretended not to know me .
Someone &apos;s missing .
I saw Tom tonight .
Tom says Mary is happy .
Why would I want to have dinner with Tom ?
I need time .
That could take a few months .
Tom drinks too much beer .
Tom put his glasses back on .
What exactly do you want to do ?
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will do that .
I &apos;d like to sleep a little longer .
Did you bring yours ?
I don &apos;t think there is a doctor here .
That &apos;s exactly what I want .
I &apos;m convinced that my son is innocent .
I just want you to come .
I don &apos;t need your money . What I need is your time .
Tom got up early .
The next time you do that , you &apos;re fired .
What have you guys been up to ?
Whose bed is that ?
I think they &apos;re happy .
I &apos;m always busy .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary the truth in the first place .
It &apos;s better than nothing .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing Tom .
Tom &apos;s not in .
Is that fun ?
I &apos;ve come here to help you .
We &apos;ve got to talk .
Do you remember the town where he was born ?
He wants to play soccer this afternoon .
I &apos;m not able to fix the computer .
Tom will be back next year .
Go and look for Tom .
Tom asked everyone questions .
Tom wouldn &apos;t want that .
Tom ate at his desk .
They &apos;re late , as usual .
Could you tell what he said ?
Tom couldn &apos;t stop .
Tom couldn &apos;t stand it .
Why do you like Boston so much ?
How often do you go there ?
Tom hadn &apos;t expected that .
I should clean the room .
I want to know what that is .
It &apos;s important , so I &apos;ll do it .
If only she had known I was in Tokyo , she would have come to visit me .
I &apos;m new .
Tom is using you .
You &apos;re on your own , Tom .
I &apos;m in love .
Can you help me a little ?
She stayed at home all day long yesterday .
Tom has a friend who &apos;s in prison .
Maybe that &apos;s the reason .
I &apos;ve only had one girlfriend .
You &apos;re looking great .
The boy playing the guitar is Tom .
I really don &apos;t want anything to eat right now .
I can &apos;t say I &apos;m surprised .
There &apos;s one just near the station .
Aren &apos;t you coming ?
I don &apos;t like anything here .
That &apos;s a good plan .
Tom left without telling anyone .
We can &apos;t do it .
Tom has been lucky .
Why are you so nervous ?
Nothing is as simple as it seems .
I would rather not go to school today .
Tom likes money .
You &apos;re too young to travel alone .
I &apos;m not in any danger .
What about you , Tom ?
Tom says that he has to go to Boston tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
We are at home .
That &apos;s just what you need now .
He told him right to his face .
How long has Tom been gone ?
That doesn &apos;t sound good .
What are you girls doing ?
We get a lot of snow here in the winter .
Can you help me , please ?
Tom seems to be sleeping .
I need to talk to you about what &apos;s going to happen tomorrow .
Tom knows what that is .
Tom was having car trouble .
He was having lunch when I entered the room .
This is me .
They usually go to school by bicycle .
Tom caught three fish .
I was busy yesterday .
I need it today .
We have nothing to left eat .
Do you think I should go by myself ?
It looks as if you &apos;re right .
I know that you &apos;re a teacher .
I &apos;m the law .
Is this Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom felt better .
I am Japanese .
Tom &apos;s very , very good .
He doesn &apos;t know what to do with his money .
Give me the money .
I can &apos;t find my glasses .
Can I close the door ?
When did I do that ?
Tell me where she lives .
It would &apos;ve been nice if Tom had been here .
He told me the truth .
You still need more sleep , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ll ask Tom tomorrow .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know how to drive .
Mary wants to become a teacher .
The river was beautiful .
I &apos;ll tell you when I get back .
Tom , I want to talk to you .
We &apos;re taking off .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to drive drunk .
This is the book Tom gave me .
We never had any problems with it .
I was just here yesterday .
Who are you and what are you doing here ?
I &apos;m your age .
Tom put the glass on the table .
I don &apos;t know what else I can say .
Tom couldn &apos;t afford to buy what Mary wanted .
I was beginning to worry .
How long have you worked for us ?
He says he drinks to forget .
Tom is nervous .
Tom brought Mary a glass of water .
Leave Tom alone .
I think I &apos;m going to like this .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom became rich .
I &apos;d like to spend a few days with Tom .
That &apos;s a plan .
Tom said he heard Mary say that .
I haven &apos;t yet asked Tom for his opinion .
I don &apos;t get it .
I know what Tom does here .
What do you see ?
He can speak not only English but also French .
I told Tom I was tired .
I came here to see if there was something I could do to help , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be anything for me to do .
What was I thinking ?
I &apos;ll tell you the truth now .
He needs it .
I have only one picture of my grandmother .
Do you have a knife ?
I intend to stay a whole week .
When did you first meet Tom ?
She will be in New York for two weeks .
I was on a bike .
Why didn &apos;t you call me sooner ?
I want everyone to hear what I have to say .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was so lonely .
The island is warm all year .
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday ?
I just don &apos;t understand why it &apos;s happened .
Tom has three cars .
What have you done with my bag ?
He lives in a large house .
I don &apos;t like this shirt . Please show me another one .
Tom wasn &apos;t looking for Mary , was he ?
Please don &apos;t sit on that bench .
I thought I was going to die .
I don &apos;t feel well . Could you give me some medicine ?
Tom was asleep .
I should move to Boston .
I know you have it with you .
Aren &apos;t you going to ask Tom ?
She &apos;s young and beautiful .
That house is mine .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go to bed .
I helped my father yesterday .
Tom told him .
Tom says that he can &apos;t wait any longer .
If you eat so much , you &apos;ll get sick .
We need to know whether it &apos;s true or not .
Why do you like Tom ?
Tom told me a long story .
Tom and Mary are in the office waiting .
I love living in Boston .
Tom can speak French , too .
He came at about four o &apos;clock .
Tom seems to be busy all the time .
Where can we buy it ?
I haven &apos;t done that yet .
Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
You &apos;ll get well soon .
I &apos;d appreciate any help you can give me .
What do you say to a beer ?
He doesn &apos;t know French at all .
I am well .
Tom meant that .
Tom said he would try .
I first met him three years ago .
Tom may do what he wants .
Tom and Mary are still watching TV .
Tom is going to have a hard time doing that .
That &apos;s not what Tom does .
Tom told me that he needed some money .
What &apos;s the name of your dog ?
They are talking about music .
How many did you get ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his brother .
I think Tom won &apos;t get bored .
I thought you &apos;d already talked to Tom .
He is a student .
He will go in your place .
Tom didn &apos;t want to pay that much for eggs , so he didn &apos;t buy any .
He is afraid of death .
I bought a book .
I see that you &apos;ve found your umbrella .
Was it you that left the door open last night ?
I didn &apos;t want to be here in the first place .
Tom helped his friends find a place to live .
Tom will win .
This road goes to the city .
I &apos;d like a word with you .
I hope Tom doesn &apos;t read this .
I &apos;m not having a good day .
I don &apos;t know who that man is .
Who bought you this ?
Tom drank a glass of wine .
Tom should be up .
Do you have anything to eat ?
I &apos;m happy to hear that .
So you do believe me ?
I have no idea who that is either .
They might be able to help us .
You can swim , can &apos;t you ?
Tom looks very young .
Could I have some more water , please ?
Can you come tomorrow ?
I want to learn guitar .
He speaks as if he were rich .
I can &apos;t believe it . Tom can &apos;t believe it either .
What do you think of this work ?
Tom wanted to leave .
There &apos;s a telephone here .
Who took the money ?
Did Tom give you anything ?
Tom saved a seat for me .
Did Tom work there ?
She can speak three languages .
You &apos;re going to be a father .
You &apos;re the first girl I ever kissed .
There is a man at the door who wants to see you .
How do I thank you ?
She lives in London .
I can &apos;t put up with it .
Tom had some questions he needed answered .
Tom knew that what he was doing was wrong .
I was invited to lunch .
I &apos;ll call him later .
Can I give you a piece of advice ?
He told me to meet him there .
I &apos;ll give it a go .
It &apos;s very hot .
Do you know why Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston with us ?
Tom had problems in school .
The school looks like a prison .
I &apos;d decided not to do that again .
Did you ever kiss Tom ?
Where is there a telephone ?
That &apos;s not what Tom wants .
You &apos;d better not go out today .
Did he say that ?
I have seen him once .
Tom is being very careful .
Do you know why I &apos;m here ?
French is not only spoken in France .
When the wine ran out , everybody went home .
She &apos;s smart and beautiful .
That &apos;s how Tom did it .
He said that he didn &apos;t know .
Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that today .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how much Mary loves him .
Do you like eating fish ?
Do you want to drink ?
I thought you were in prison .
Tom did that well .
Tom isn &apos;t working .
What does Tom owe you ?
He lost his life in an accident .
I can &apos;t eat all that by myself .
I really don &apos;t understand what &apos;s so funny .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really Tom .
It &apos;s no use asking him for help .
She took to her new teacher .
You need a vacation .
Why do you want that ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know that .
I &apos;m not very hungry .
The door won &apos;t open .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think it was possible .
Leave some cake for the rest of us .
You are too late .
Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a good idea ?
No one said anything .
Tom has been living out of a suitcase for the past two months .
I didn &apos;t have time to explain everything to Tom .
We know Tom is in there .
I am to blame for this mistake .
You don &apos;t have to be here .
How &apos;s your boy doing ?
I don &apos;t want to answer the question .
You know very well how it happened .
Tom no longer has to do that .
Tom is good at speaking French .
All my friends do it .
He will do his best .
Tom isn &apos;t going to buy a camera .
I &apos;d like to see you if possible .
I promised Tom I &apos;d help him .
I &apos;m going to Boston .
Tom has a big problem .
Tom asked Mary to go to the store to buy some bread .
He put milk in his coffee .
What &apos;s your horse &apos;s name ?
I met a friend of mine at the airport .
I come from China .
How can Tom not understand that ?
You were in danger .
Nobody knows except Tom and me .
Let &apos;s study French .
Tom knew it was wrong .
I &apos;m not here because of that .
I &apos;ll phone you later .
Tom didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
Mary is talking in her sleep .
Ask Tom if he &apos;ll stay in Australia .
Please wait thirty minutes .
We want it .
Tom took his glasses off and put them in his pocket .
Tom moved to Boston three years ago .
I hope she &apos;s safe .
It doesn &apos;t have a name .
I &apos;d like you to help me do that .
Have you ever been in Boston before ?
When did you start studying English ?
What is this fish called in English ?
Don &apos;t eat so much . You &apos;ll get fat .
Tom and I aren &apos;t going to study together this evening .
Call me if you need anything .
I was worried for nothing .
Tom called back .
You must quit drinking .
My watch is ten minutes fast .
Can I stay a little longer ?
Tom went shopping with his family .
I don &apos;t know why Tom is so busy today .
He &apos;s interested in you .
You are only young once .
She was playing with her sister at that time .
You &apos;ve done it !
It won &apos;t make any difference .
Tom likes to stay at home alone .
Did you see her face ?
Now I understand .
All of us can speak French .
I &apos;ll ask Tom to help me .
Tom is too tired to study .
Tom is going to be right back .
Let &apos;s definitely do that .
I &apos;m the one who &apos;s sick .
If what Tom told me is true , then we have nothing to worry about .
Tom came just before dinner .
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll teach you how to drive .
Tom is studying hard .
What do you have to say ?
I don &apos;t know what I should do .
If you have something to say , say it to my face .
We need to talk with them .
I think I understand .
Tom does that because he has to .
We want to be here for Tom .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you &apos;re looking for him .
Tom is not as fat as me .
I think Tom was speaking French .
His son is ill .
Tom walked home .
He isn &apos;t going to buy a camera .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand that .
Come on , it &apos;ll be fun .
Do you want anything ?
Tom wasn &apos;t shy .
I &apos;ve got to try to find Tom .
You &apos;re free to say what you think .
We have to talk .
Tom eats lunch at his desk .
I know him better than anybody .
I hate it when this happens .
Take as much as you like .
You should ask Tom yourself .
I do some work for Tom from time to time .
We &apos;ve done everything possible .
Tom looks rather nervous .
Some fish fly .
Your glasses fell on the floor .
They aren &apos;t rich .
Why don &apos;t you want this ?
Is that your car ?
Do you know where we live ?
They aren &apos;t coming today .
I &apos;m angry with Tom .
I want some paper .
Your friend is correct .
Why don &apos;t you take a break , Tom ?
Tom thought he would be late .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about me .
I could not speak to him .
What are you really here for anyway ?
If you don &apos;t believe me , ask Tom .
You don &apos;t need to study today .
Tom said he &apos;d be able to help us do that tomorrow afternoon .
I know a lot about Australia .
Tom is talking .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom for days .
Tom looks worried .
That boy looks like you .
I think I &apos;ll go to Boston next weekend .
We &apos;re going back to Boston .
Can he speak French ?
It &apos;s time to leave .
Make sure you do that , OK ?
This is just water .
You can smoke here .
I think I lost my keys .
Tom is willing to do almost anything for Mary .
They won &apos;t believe me .
Tom and I &apos;ve been friends for years .
There &apos;s nothing to lose .
She lives in a large house .
Tom said he didn &apos;t speak French very well .
That &apos;s what I thought .
Tom gave Mary his phone number .
What did you get for Christmas ?
I wonder why Tom is doing that .
I speak French a little .
I don &apos;t live here .
Is Tom all right ?
I believe it to be true .
I like working with Tom .
What a night !
Not all girls are like that .
My father always gets nervous .
I don &apos;t believe it at all .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve come .
Why is swimming not allowed in this river ?
Were both Tom and Mary born in Australia ?
What &apos;s going on with you and Tom ?
We are at war .
We know this song .
I think Tom would have liked that .
Tom told me that he wanted to study French .
You don &apos;t need to go there if you don &apos;t want to .
Will you let me see you again ?
The job is as good as done .
I don &apos;t have to go .
I &apos;m lonely .
He didn &apos;t think it was funny .
Tom wanted to know how Mary had become so rich .
Please come here .
The apples are red .
I helped him with his homework .
I might ask Tom what happened .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Did you read this morning &apos;s newspaper ?
I &apos;ll be fine .
I should have come earlier .
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him .
Tom and Mary married when they were young .
How big is this park ?
Tom missed the last train home .
He can &apos;t walk any more .
I asked Tom what he wanted to do .
Tom made me say those things .
You &apos;d better not tell him .
I think Tom is doing that , too .
Tom is pretty nervous .
Is Tom still awake ?
Tom is talking in his sleep again .
Are you still Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
Everybody likes you .
Tom made a good speech .
Let Tom do it .
Tom didn &apos;t like that .
We &apos;re not going to stop here .
Tom likes running .
It &apos;s very dark .
I don &apos;t like what &apos;s going on .
Go home now .
Where are you on Monday ?
I should &apos;ve known you &apos;d come back .
Tom had Mary do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t agree .
They want more .
We &apos;re staying there for three months .
It is me that is wrong .
Tom still has feelings for Mary .
Tom turned on the TV .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand what you want .
You know what to do .
Tom believes every word I say .
You &apos;re not rich .
I &apos;m not going to kiss you , Tom .
Tom may have read the letter .
Are you taller than Tom ?
Tom wants to be here .
I &apos;ve known Tom since we were both kids .
You haven &apos;t eaten anything .
It &apos;s free of charge .
Tom has really taught me many things .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be at home .
I have to do that .
What have you come here for ?
That &apos;s a pretty big fish you &apos;ve just caught .
Tom wouldn &apos;t move .
I &apos;ve heard that .
I wish I &apos;d been here three hours ago .
What would Tom say about this ?
I called Tom up from Boston .
I don &apos;t think Tom is happy .
Are you saying Tom isn &apos;t happy ?
Do you think you &apos;ll see Tom again ?
This book is hard for me to read .
I was in Boston for almost the whole summer .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t go there by herself .
This is my job .
Come tomorrow morning .
Tom said he felt disappointed .
Tom says it &apos;s up to Mary .
You don &apos;t have to make a decision now .
We won &apos;t need your help today .
It happened in Boston .
We &apos;d better just call it a day .
We have a lot of things we need to do today .
What happened ?
I &apos;m as tall as Tom .
I gave him a book .
Tom was there for me when I needed him .
He has nothing to do with it .
Tom is too young to get married .
I like baseball .
I think he is a doctor .
It &apos;s almost time to go to bed .
Bring Tom inside .
He must have forgotten all about the promise .
I wish we &apos;d done that .
Is this too big ?
My family is not very large .
Ask around .
Do you want to leave now ?
I can speak English .
I have no time to go to America .
We &apos;ll help you out .
We &apos;re a little early .
This month was kind of difficult .
I made Tom go home .
I never realized how much I &apos;d miss you .
Who doesn &apos;t do that ?
He laughed .
She goes to school .
Mary is going to have a baby .
Tom decided to stay .
Tom and Mary had the same idea .
She is not as beautiful as she was before .
Tom says Mary needs more time to finish her report .
Was Tom funny ?
Tom is scared of Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
He drives fast .
Tom wears glasses .
It &apos;s not true .
That &apos;s too long .
You look like a policeman .
Do you want to leave it like that ?
Is it too late ?
I know what you want .
Isn &apos;t that a good thing ?
I can &apos;t remember what this is called .
I sure hope you &apos;re right .
The keys are on the table .
I &apos;m with him .
I &apos;ve all but finished doing that .
My birthday is the same as Tom &apos;s .
Tom isn &apos;t a good boy .
Tom pretended to be a doctor .
Most boys know his name .
You &apos;re Canadian , aren &apos;t you ?
My father quit drinking .
I like tennis very much .
He knows the truth .
I plan to be in Boston until October .
Tom came up to me after class and asked me a few questions .
Where did you stay in Boston ?
I &apos;m not leaving until tomorrow .
She is angry with me .
I &apos;ve been there before .
When is your birthday ?
Where did the other one go ?
I sat next to Tom .
Why are you so popular ?
I didn &apos;t know you could do that .
I &apos;m convinced we can do it .
Can you speak any language other than French ?
Tom has to look after his mother .
They don &apos;t know each other very well .
I &apos;m not good at tennis .
I like them all .
Children often make mistakes .
Why do you think that I &apos;m thinking about you ?
Tom lives in a big house .
Tom usually doesn &apos;t go to work by car .
How do we do that ?
We come here every day .
You don &apos;t want that .
Tom wasn &apos;t telling the truth about where he &apos;d been .
Did Tom say why Mary isn &apos;t here today ?
He came to Japan when he was 10 years old .
Tom bought Mary a camera .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to a good school .
He wanted to meet you .
We &apos;ve been here before .
Tom drove his children to school .
Tom is in his office .
This is my house .
Why isn &apos;t Tom happy ?
I got on the horse .
They don &apos;t want you .
We &apos;re college students .
Where is Tom sleeping ?
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go home .
Everyone in my family is happy .
It &apos;s not always easy .
I lost my key somewhere around here .
This report is well written .
Did I miss the party ?
They &apos;ll take care of Tom .
That &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
I came in through the window .
How can I forget it ?
Has Tom ever seen you win ?
This must be changed .
Here &apos;s a letter for you .
Don &apos;t make me angry . You wouldn &apos;t like me when I &apos;m angry .
It began raining just now .
You should do that soon .
Did you sleep OK ?
You &apos;re the first girl I &apos;ve ever kissed .
What is it that you want , Tom ?
Tell me what I have to do .
You don &apos;t have to decide right now .
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I had no choice . &quot;
This is my sister .
Whose book is this ?
The baby started to cry .
I thought Tom had a dog .
I could hardly tell who was who .
Tom has left his family .
She has to stop smoking .
I don &apos;t see you .
Tom had other things he wanted to do .
Tom &apos;s happy not to be in your shoes .
I was alone , studying .
Tom is going on vacation tomorrow .
I &apos;m very sorry about this .
I asked Tom to wait for a few more minutes .
I found the money .
There &apos;s not much you can do about it .
Tom and Mary are my children .
What do I have to do to convince you ?
I want to go to the park .
I &apos;m coming right away .
Tom and Mary must have something in common .
The dog ran after the ball .
That &apos;s how we did it .
How did it end ?
Tom never called .
Tom knows Mary better than I do .
Tom did it right away .
Tom set the bird free .
Tom is easy to get along with .
Tom likes apples .
I didn &apos;t read it all .
That &apos;s not easy .
Do you like this ?
I was too happy to sleep .
She went to the hospital yesterday .
She looks just like my sister .
You &apos;ve changed .
Don &apos;t make an enemy of Tom .
I met Tom at a party .
He came here ten minutes ago .
We must finish our homework first .
Tom said he wanted to stay at home all day .
Tom bought drinks for everybody .
Tom is early .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what this is .
You should try to be more like Tom .
What else could you expect ?
Tom saw everything .
That &apos;s my boy .
Can we help ?
Did you drink a lot ?
Tom bought some bread .
I shouldn &apos;t have sold my car .
It &apos;s going to rain this evening .
He brought his dog to school .
Tom doesn &apos;t always do what others expect .
I hit Tom .
Tom said that Mary likes you .
Did Tom really say that ?
Those people over there are speaking French .
The cat is sleeping on the table .
It would be better to try .
Tom wasn &apos;t in .
What Tom has told you is true .
Did you have fun in Boston ?
Does Tom have a secret ?
We &apos;re going in here .
She read his letter again and again .
Tom is great .
I have a great deal to do .
This isn &apos;t about you .
Please wait here for a while .
Tom can &apos;t do that .
What is it you really want to tell me ?
I &apos;ve always wondered what it would be like to be rich .
He does not like cats .
What &apos;s with everybody ?
Keep the change !
Tom lived there all by himself .
Do you really want to wear that ?
People around here often do that .
Would you mind not doing that ?
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom .
How long will it take me to finish my homework ?
Tom wrote this letter .
You will need time to understand .
I want Tom to come home .
Please give me a glass of water .
Give me the knife .
How far away is your school ?
Do you remember who told you that ?
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a man .
I don &apos;t think Tom took us seriously .
Nothing happened today .
I think Tom is thirty .
That ball could &apos;ve hit me .
Tom seems to enjoy speaking French .
Please tell Tom that Mary called .
He got rich quickly .
America loves you .
How did Tom like the gift you gave him ?
I was expecting you last night .
Tom didn &apos;t want that .
I &apos;m here to have fun .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three years .
It &apos;s time to go to bed . Turn off the radio .
What makes you think I &apos;d want to see that ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
They &apos;re outside .
Have you already met him ?
No one is going to understand you .
Is anybody here ?
I &apos;ve been worried sick about you .
I came here to learn French .
Tom has a good job .
Did you fall in love with her at first sight ?
I have more books than I can read .
They really did win .
Was the book interesting ?
Tom will never be able to do that .
I &apos;d like to help you .
Is this your homework ?
I have read that story in some book .
Tom thinks Mary is here .
Tom used to go to school with Mary .
We have a lot of things that need to be done .
I was born here .
Tom shut his eyes .
I have to go to the little boys &apos; room .
Tom is not looking happy .
Tom realized that he might need more money .
Tom loves Mary more than I do .
My hair &apos;s too long .
What did you have for lunch ?
Tom can swim , but Mary can &apos;t .
Tom isn &apos;t at home , is he ?
That &apos;s not going to stop me .
I will explain it to her .
Tom is quite old .
He wears glasses .
I thought I told you not to come .
I should just tell Tom the truth .
What do you like ?
I &apos;m going there now .
Don &apos;t leave the room .
I knew Tom was waiting for Mary .
Do you know how deep the water is here ?
You will be better soon .
Tom is working on it .
Tom doesn &apos;t watch a lot of TV .
That wasn &apos;t bad .
People say that he &apos;s still alive .
He can &apos;t be under thirty .
Aren &apos;t you going to be there ?
Tom thought it would be difficult for Mary to get a ticket to that concert .
Is it too far to walk ?
Please telephone him .
Her friends look up to her .
I &apos;m going to study French this afternoon .
Tom , is that you ?
I ran .
Did Tom buy it ?
The restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I expected it to be .
Did somebody get hurt ?
Tom asked Mary to read it for him .
I want you here .
Let Tom know .
I know a man who speaks French .
You don &apos;t even know Tom .
I think Tom looks really good .
I &apos;ll go look for Tom .
This isn &apos;t about me .
I see him in the library now and then .
I can do it by myself .
I don &apos;t have to say anything to Tom .
We &apos;re not going home .
You have friends here .
This isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
I bought him a drink in return for his help .
You said you &apos;d go to Boston with me .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
Tom is the father .
I didn &apos;t know what to do next .
I made that for Tom .
Tom &apos;s safe .
Tom and I are not a couple .
I am not coming today .
Tom could die .
You shouldn &apos;t wait here .
Do you know how to get home ?
This is their house .
Tom eats a lot .
What did Tom have to eat ?
Tom says he comes here every year .
I wish you weren &apos;t always so busy .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
Tom made many mistakes .
Nobody seems to know where Tom is .
I wonder what Tom means by that .
I read the whole book in one day .
Tom wanted to live .
Tom is going to Boston .
I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go .
What &apos;s your take on this ?
What you are saying does not make sense .
Why are you mad at Tom ?
It looks very expensive .
Tom told Mary not to swim with John .
She can &apos;t afford it .
Tom wants us to go to church .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows I &apos;m Canadian .
It wasn &apos;t hard to understand .
When did the accident happen ?
Tom didn &apos;t have a chance .
Why are you saying that to me ?
It &apos;s very small .
We don &apos;t need your help .
Everyone was happy .
I like to play tennis .
I &apos;m pretty sure the first thing you &apos;ll want to do when you get to Boston is call home .
Tom is worried about his future .
They are at lunch .
This table is in the way .
Tom has to speak French at work .
Please write down my address .
Tom wanted people to like him .
Tom found one .
Tom and Mary almost got married last summer .
Why do you think Tom wanted to do that today ?
I &apos;d love to see them .
I can &apos;t understand that word .
Tom does this all the time .
Tom said he didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
Tom read a lot .
Tom knows us very well .
The only girl that will even talk to Tom is Mary .
Do you have a TV ?
I just wanted to see you again .
This book isn &apos;t as easy as that one .
You can &apos;t hope to have your own way in everything .
Is this a river ?
He fell into a deep sleep .
We &apos;re at home .
He can swim faster than any other boy in his class .
Look at that one .
This is the first time I &apos;ve been here .
Tom sat in front of me .
The teacher and I sat face to face .
Tom said that he couldn &apos;t wait anymore .
You &apos;ll find out soon enough .
I still remember his name .
Give it to me .
I hope that &apos;s not true .
You have to follow the rules .
Don &apos;t you think I know my own father ?
I will help him tomorrow .
Tom asked Mary several questions .
We played a baseball game yesterday .
Everybody knew Tom was in trouble .
Tom can help me .
Whose room is this ?
You &apos;re not going to do it , are you ?
Why does Tom always look so tired ?
Where did you hear that ?
I &apos;ve just finished eating breakfast .
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
Our school is in this village .
They don &apos;t like to do that .
When I saw him last , he was still a child .
Tom looks a lot older than he really is .
I had no idea who she was .
The train got in on time .
Tom should be given a chance .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m too tired to help him .
Tom told everyone that he was able to speak three languages .
I &apos;m as old as Tom is .
It &apos;s very hot today .
What did Tom want ?
Tom wanted to have dinner in bed .
How did Tom pay for all this ?
I hear you &apos;re very rich .
Tom is only a couple of years older than me .
You &apos;d better stay here .
He will go to New York next month .
Nothing can stop him .
You don &apos;t happen to know where Tom is , do you ?
She herself gave him something to eat .
I &apos;m seeing you in a new light .
What was Tom doing out there all by himself ?
I need this job .
He is far from honest .
I don &apos;t know those people .
I was tired after doing that .
We have to buy them from abroad .
Do you like my new clothes ?
It &apos;s been ten years since I came to this town .
Tell me your plan .
Tom didn &apos;t give up hope .
You could drive home by yourself .
Tom has a cat , but Mary doesn &apos;t .
Tom likes to play tennis .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come or not .
Get serious .
My father used to eat at this restaurant .
Why are you planning on going home early today ?
Tom is in a meeting right now .
Who are you ? What &apos;re you doing here ?
Tom died before Mary was born .
Tom makes Mary very happy .
I have as much time as you do .
The movie was almost three hours long .
I think I should &apos;ve asked Tom to help .
You &apos;re good at doing that .
Look ! She &apos;s coming !
Your name isn &apos;t Tom , is it ?
How many cats are there in this house ?
You &apos;ve got to help me .
I know about Tom .
A man must be honest .
I &apos;ll go tomorrow if the weather is good .
I need to go to work .
We &apos;re still looking for Tom .
Where is the problem ?
Give me a light , would you ?
We don &apos;t need him .
I &apos;ve told you not to call me Tom .
Please come again .
Tom didn &apos;t think that what Mary said was true .
We &apos;re not married .
Can I borrow your computer ?
My sister is three years older than I am .
Tom is the only person I &apos;ve ever really been in love with .
That wasn &apos;t so bad , was it ?
You &apos;re the enemy .
I want to see you as soon as possible .
Tom said he could help Mary .
You came too late .
We want a car .
Tom said he wanted to be there before 2 : 30 .
Who &apos;s that in the car with Tom ?
Tom has to walk to school every morning .
I &apos;m just looking .
Who stole the apple ?
I &apos;d like to know what your opinion is .
She lives far from there .
I &apos;ve been better .
We have a lot of time .
My friend helped me .
It &apos;s not like I want you here .
What we do is up to you .
You don &apos;t have to tell Tom twice to do something .
Tom doesn &apos;t look anything like his brother .
I &apos;m not over it .
I &apos;m not Tom . I &apos;m John .
I like them .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think Alice was pretty .
It was my fault .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d seen John .
This car is going to break down .
Tom said that he thought that it could happen in Boston , too .
We get along really well .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
We don &apos;t want to know .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom can do that .
I &apos;d like to live in Boston .
Do you have a family , Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t in this picture .
Did you write this book ?
Do you really want me to go there right now ?
I &apos;m going to my grandmother &apos;s .
Tom put down his coffee and picked up his phone .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything since yesterday .
I &apos;m going to go sit in my car .
Tom told me not to do it this way .
What &apos;s that guy &apos;s name ?
I will give you a call as soon as I know for sure .
I understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
I &apos;ve missed another chance .
It &apos;s happened .
My family lives in Boston .
I also wanted to know .
I had no idea you could dance .
You have to decide that for yourself .
Tom had a good opinion of Mary .
Why are you in such a bad mood ?
That kind of thing can &apos;t be found just anywhere .
I don &apos;t remember Tom &apos;s face .
Tom is going to be glad to see you .
I am interested in this book .
What &apos;ll Tom say ?
What &apos;s the best way to learn how to swim ?
Nobody wants to play with Tom .
Who is going to speak tonight ?
What was I saying ?
You &apos;re not a child anymore .
Tom didn &apos;t even want to go to the park .
I haven &apos;t told Tom anything .
He &apos;s almost always in the hospital .
That one &apos;s good .
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is .
It &apos;s not a secret .
Tom needs to go to the hospital .
I like dogs more than cats .
I &apos;m a good student .
Tom and Mary usually go to school by bicycle .
He told me about it .
Why does Tom want to stay in Boston ?
It &apos;s great to be here .
I &apos;m already at work .
Why don &apos;t we take a look ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did it .
Tom knew that I was ready .
Your name &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
What do you take me for ?
Will you let Tom leave ?
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is .
That won &apos;t work .
You don &apos;t want to do this .
It couldn &apos;t be Tom .
I left Japan for the first time in ten years .
Tom has started studying French .
I do the best I can .
Do you guys want to have some fun ?
Tom always does that in the summer .
Why do you want to die ?
I like coffee hot .
You should see a doctor .
It &apos;s hot today , isn &apos;t it ?
I saw one .
Tom is easy to talk to .
She is talking .
I &apos;m so happy .
Tom already knew the answer .
Tom and Mary are getting married .
I want to know what to expect .
Her bed is next to the wall .
What have you been doing all this time !
My book is here .
Tom never told me what happened .
I don &apos;t like what I &apos;m seeing .
We &apos;re never giving up hope .
I &apos;m having dinner now .
What would you like to do tomorrow ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like us ?
I know very little about him .
You know him .
We &apos;ll go there again .
I need to borrow some money .
Tom seems stupid .
He works every day except Sunday .
I want you to do this .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt Tom .
They believe in a life after death .
I don &apos;t fear death .
Don &apos;t play in the street .
I &apos;m still looking for a job .
Tom isn &apos;t looking .
Tom has a lot of things to do .
Who &apos;ll come ?
I didn &apos;t have enough time to do what I wanted to do .
It is too late .
There must be a solution .
I thought Tom told you about me .
Tom asked too many questions .
I don &apos;t like pizza anymore .
Tom knows what he &apos;s going to do .
Tom is in his car .
I hope you caught more fish than I did .
I didn &apos;t say you took it .
Tom won &apos;t live much longer .
The teacher didn &apos;t let the students ask any questions .
I forgot my own birthday .
She is no less beautiful than her mother .
I think I &apos;ve had a little too much to drink .
I &apos;m sorry I have no pencil to write with .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .
We know it &apos;s not about that .
Tom is exactly the same age as me .
Tom thought Mary was right .
He doesn &apos;t eat anything other than fruit .
Don &apos;t go out there .
I know exactly where you are .
He is able to speak five languages .
I have another job now .
He broke into a house .
You must apologize to her , and do it at once .
You have to see it .
Who was the woman you were talking to ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know Mary .
Maybe I don &apos;t want to know .
Do you believe him ?
Tom and Mary are both students .
We can &apos;t go back .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will come .
You &apos;ve hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
Tom can speak French pretty well .
I &apos;ll give you anything you want .
How do we find it ?
Why don &apos;t you go there ?
What do you want us to do ?
Did Tom vote ?
I don &apos;t know what you want .
She is proud that her son has become a doctor .
Mary has a new boyfriend .
That joke was funny .
I like being a teacher .
Who am I speaking to ?
You &apos;re absolutely wrong .
I &apos;ve spoken in French with Tom many times .
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends .
It &apos;s really Tom .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I &apos;m glad you like my apartment .
Tom seemed to have been very busy .
I remember them .
How bad do you want this job ?
He started to sing .
I forgot how good you were at golf .
Who are the people I saw her with ?
Can you walk to school , or do you have to take the bus ?
You have to move .
Tom has seen it , too .
Tom may not be happy .
I &apos;d like you to be there .
What did he say ?
Ask her what her name is .
Tom needs a job .
I feel so lonely .
Those are our books .
Go and find Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t drink the milk .
Do you have beer ?
I go to school .
Tom can run faster than me .
I can &apos;t believe that you like that restaurant .
I thought that he knew everything about Japan .
Did you see Tom today ?
Tom says he knows you .
Did you go and see Tom ?
I want to get married and I want to have kids .
What does Tom want us to do ?
I didn &apos;t do anything .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me .
When did you marry your wife ?
Tom dropped his books on the floor .
It &apos;s going really well .
No one else was in the room .
Are you writing a letter ?
You must know Tom very well .
I will go to the university tomorrow , too .
He &apos;s been waiting here for a long time .
She has a new man in her life .
You are not a student .
I don &apos;t think I said that .
I lost my key .
You look pretty drunk .
How many hours a day does Tom watch TV ?
Tom certainly won &apos;t get my vote .
That goes without saying .
It &apos;s not against the law .
I didn &apos;t see you .
Tom sat on the bench with Mary .
It &apos;s not clean .
Tom lost his son in the war .
I never learned how to swim .
Tom knows Mary can &apos;t speak French very well .
I went on with my reading .
Tom has a small car .
No one would talk about it .
Where do you want us to go ?
I wanted to dance .
Tom will come .
Are you Tom ?
Tom told me about the accident .
I want you with me .
I only have ten books .
Tom has already done it .
Tom found Mary a good job .
Tom seemed hurt .
That &apos;s not how it is .
We know they &apos;ll come .
We &apos;ve had a lot of rain this year .
Tom seemed surprised at the news .
Every day he says something different .
Tom was convinced that Mary no longer loved him .
I can &apos;t tell Tom the truth .
I hate myself sometimes .
I &apos;m driving to Boston tomorrow to visit Tom .
The girl doesn &apos;t like to play soccer .
I &apos;m going to take Tom home .
It is easy for me to solve the problem .
I see why you don &apos;t want to go there .
What do you think they are ?
What did you do exactly ?
Tom said he was glad that he didn &apos;t do that .
They didn &apos;t do anything .
It &apos;s easy to answer your question .
Do you know who they are ?
I like it out here .
This wouldn &apos;t be about Tom , would it ?
Come alone .
Tom closed his eyes and thought about Mary .
You have to go .
What kind of things do you enjoy doing ?
Why don &apos;t you take a taxi ?
Do you think you &apos;ll be happy here ?
Tom knows he has no choice .
Could you do that , Tom ?
Please give me a piece of paper to write on .
I like languages .
We only want to help you , Tom .
I must find Tom .
He does not listen .
I &apos;m studying several languages .
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is ?
This man loves my sister .
It &apos;s a big world .
You don &apos;t seem to care what happens .
What Tom said wasn &apos;t true .
Tom is much older than I am .
Tom wanted to speak with Mary .
I know that Tom is in love with Mary .
I want you to be with me .
Did Tom say what it was about ?
You know who I am , don &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
They say that he &apos;s still alive .
He &apos;s ready to go .
Try to keep your eyes open .
They made the right choice .
Tom sat down on a bench .
No one came with me .
You should stay at home today .
My father &apos;s car is very nice .
That doesn &apos;t change anything .
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him .
Tell me why you think that .
He isn &apos;t young .
I think I won &apos;t go to work today .
He looked quite tired .
I &apos;m extremely sorry .
Get away from here .
Come on , Tom . Let &apos;s go home .
This is sick .
Tom might become famous .
Tom had never kissed a girl before .
You shouldn &apos;t leave the baby alone .
Who does Tom think is going to win ?
Tom knew that Mary was tired .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to move to Boston .
I can speak French .
I &apos;m afraid .
It would &apos;ve been better if we hadn &apos;t done that .
I knew I could do it .
We waited for you all day long .
I have something else I need you to do .
Have you been married for a long time ?
I want to go home and sleep .
You look healthy .
It &apos;s been fun .
She &apos;s only a child .
Do you think you can do this alone ?
I was invited by an old friend .
I bought it for 10 dollars .
Is Tom going home ?
You should &apos;ve seen that movie last night .
How long have you been learning English ?
You &apos;re no longer part of my life .
He has been dead for three years .
This is not good .
I hope we &apos;ll be seeing you around here soon .
I think Tom hates my dog .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
I didn &apos;t know it at the time .
I want to stay home and read a book .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you ever again .
What does this word mean ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to work .
This looks great .
You know why we &apos;re here .
This winter will probably be very cold .
Let &apos;s begin our work at once .
It is going to rain very soon .
I came here to make you an offer .
What made you think of that ?
I didn &apos;t realize it was so late .
I &apos;m going to give it to you .
Tom studied French .
You should meet him .
Can I see , too ?
Tom didn &apos;t go to work all last week .
He came here again .
I &apos;ll walk home .
If someone &apos;s in trouble , you should help them .
Tom can &apos;t talk .
No one lives in that building .
She tried .
Tom works here .
I gave Tom my word that I wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary about that .
I don &apos;t quite agree .
I will play tennis this afternoon .
He doesn &apos;t live there anymore .
Tom hasn &apos;t called .
All is quiet .
Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
Did you find another picture ?
Who likes Tom ?
There &apos;s a new boy in school .
What is two times two ?
My uncle , who lives in Paris , came to see us .
That isn &apos;t enough .
I &apos;ve got almost everything I need .
I &apos;ll come when I have done my homework .
I come from a big family .
Let &apos;s begin at the beginning .
Tom is married , Mary isn &apos;t .
Tom didn &apos;t need it .
Tom didn &apos;t really seem surprised .
Are you feeling better , Tom ?
I &apos;m convinced that my daughter will pass the exam .
He is having lunch now .
Tom seems to always be running into people he knows .
They went to the movies last night .
I have to go shopping .
It was night .
Tom and Mary just got married last year .
I wasn &apos;t busy .
Where did you get this money ?
Tom died three weeks later .
She looks exactly the same as she was at school .
You don &apos;t want to say no to Tom .
It &apos;s not up to you .
Come back in a week .
I asked Tom to sing .
How long has she been sick ?
I &apos;m not going to open this .
It makes me kind of happy .
I came here to tell you something .
I want your money .
I &apos;m not so convinced .
It looks like no one &apos;s home .
Do you think it was Tom who did that ?
He didn &apos;t know what to do next .
I left earlier than my sister .
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle .
We need to know where Tom is now .
You &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
Tom wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
Did Tom swim yesterday ?
You need not go there .
It was too expensive .
You shouldn &apos;t go to school .
I had not waited long before the bus came .
I will help you when I have finished my work .
Tell me what it was like .
What did you do in Boston ?
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him .
Can &apos;t you help us ?
He seems hungry .
I was waiting for you .
Tom and Mary looked into each other &apos;s eyes .
&quot; What &apos;s your name ? &quot; I asked .
I don &apos;t make mistakes very often .
We &apos;re friends .
Tom did it all .
I &apos;m a little hungry .
Tom told me I &apos;m better at doing that than Mary is .
It &apos;s said that he knows the secret .
I know Tom is mad .
You are absolutely right .
I &apos;m eating now .
I &apos;d like to see Tom .
I was afraid of my father .
Tom must be innocent .
Tom is very interesting .
I met his sister last week .
Do you wish to see my passport ?
I know how angry you are .
I don &apos;t have any books to read .
Tom goes abroad every year .
How about another piece of cake ?
My family is living in Boston .
He was seriously injured in a traffic accident .
I &apos;m still in school .
We enjoyed the party very much .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t forget Tom .
There are more women than men in the world .
Tom never did anything for anybody , except for himself .
Has it arrived ?
Tom came in and immediately sat down .
We &apos;ve got time .
That &apos;s a good idea !
Tom has bought a house in Boston .
Why can &apos;t I go ?
Our friends took a walk in the park .
I know the house where he was born .
I wish you &apos;d never been born .
She gave me several books .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will get here .
I found her kind .
Tom said he &apos;s fine .
She could solve the problem , and so could I .
I decided to buy a car .
Tom is waiting to see what will happen .
Did Tom buy anything ?
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him .
No one will believe us .
That &apos;s too much .
He wants the camera badly .
It &apos;s great to see you .
I do not know anything about him .
I need to speak to someone right away .
That is your book .
I &apos;ll take Tom to Mary .
Don &apos;t do it , Tom .
The island is covered with ice and snow during the winter .
Can you buy one for me as well ?
Thank you for your explanation .
We don &apos;t want you to do that .
We were just talking about you .
I know Tom has been hurt .
Tom is very kind to us .
Is there something that you want ?
He lives in Boston .
That medicine helped a lot .
Tom is not too pleased .
He lives somewhere around here .
Could you please take me back home ?
I loved that house .
I haven &apos;t heard anything .
You did that really well .
I don &apos;t care how long ago it was .
Tom must be hungry .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
You should never ask a woman her age .
I &apos;ll be at home the next time she comes .
Could you show me the way to the station ?
Go back to sleep .
Would you please show me how it &apos;s done ?
I know that Tom is nice .
Tom wants to learn how to talk to girls .
Tom couldn &apos;t find anyone to dance with .
Tom wants his money today .
You can use a dictionary for this exam .
Tom has no friends to talk with .
It takes you an hour to go to the station on foot .
I can &apos;t sing .
Tom and I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Tom wanted to know what had happened .
You &apos;re not very good at it , are you ?
I don &apos;t want to call the police .
I &apos;m there for you .
You can &apos;t even help yourself .
I &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s Tom .
Let me show you how to do that .
It &apos;s what I &apos;m used to .
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday .
I &apos;m coming to Boston in October .
Don &apos;t come here anymore .
What else ?
I think Tom knows where Mary lives .
Tom might have missed the train . He hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
I &apos;m trying to learn French .
Tom is working on the new plan .
Tom needs your love .
I &apos;ll see you in class .
Tom didn &apos;t quite know what Mary meant .
I haven &apos;t seen you in three years .
How well do you know Tom ?
I might not go swimming today .
I know Tom has gone to Boston .
It almost worked .
There are too many people in this room .
I go right home after work .
Can &apos;t you stay a little longer ?
She &apos;s forgotten how to do it .
I &apos;ll take Tom home .
You &apos;ll have to do it , whether you like it or not .
I rarely see Tom anymore .
Have any letters arrived for me ?
How did you like the party ?
The man is all but dead .
Tom read a book all morning .
I talk in my sleep very often .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s all true .
I hope that Tom will never do that again .
He left early in order not to be late .
Tom has been in prison for a long time .
Who is that woman ?
You want to go to Boston with Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Tom won &apos;t be here till 2 : 30 .
There has to be a way .
I &apos;ll meet with Tom .
I can &apos;t speak English at all .
She is not tall .
Tom taught me some French .
You should not give your children everything they want .
I hope Tom comes soon .
Tom lost .
Why do you think I came ?
I enjoy reading books .
They won &apos;t help you .
They don &apos;t seem to be Americans .
What do you have on for tomorrow night ?
Please don &apos;t sit there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom &apos;s around at the moment .
I quit smoking a year ago .
I &apos;m going home now .
Is Tom satisfied ?
Please ask whether they have this book at the library .
I saw them .
I &apos;ve got to leave soon .
Tom isn &apos;t in jail anymore .
No one is going to know .
Nobody does that .
Did he come by bus or by train ?
I have eight brothers and sisters .
What did you buy ?
Tom has a picture he wants to show us .
He and I are friends .
Do you know Tom and Mary ?
We need to clean the car .
It makes me feel sad .
My headache has gone .
How are you , Tom ?
He &apos;s a good boy .
I &apos;m not like Tom .
&quot; Who helped you ? &quot; &quot; Tom did . &quot;
No one lives in this house anymore .
Tom appears nervous .
This house is far too small .
It &apos;s nice and warm in here .
One must do one &apos;s best in everything .
I didn &apos;t really know what to do .
Have you finished writing the letter ?
Tell Tom which bus to take .
He finished reading the book .
We both know Tom is innocent .
&quot; What were you just doing ? &quot; &quot; I was talking to Tom . &quot;
Have you had lunch ?
You can use my desk if you want .
Don &apos;t you want to help ?
I &apos;m still not talking to you .
They found it .
I just hope no one saw me .
This dog is white .
We &apos;re not where we want to be .
I &apos;ll be working all day tomorrow .
You have what it takes .
How hungry are you ?
I can &apos;t keep you here any longer .
We need more people like you .
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston .
I learned a lot from you .
She is always scared .
The train arrived in London .
You &apos;re driving me crazy .
I can &apos;t do anything about it now .
Tom knows I &apos;m at home .
Tom asked to be left alone .
Can you remember his name ?
That one over there &apos;s really cute .
Tom really likes going to the movies .
All you need to do is wait .
Let &apos;s dance .
How often do I have to tell you ?
I &apos;ll never forget that .
How about you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to apologize .
You don &apos;t have to come if you don &apos;t want to .
What &apos;s Tom doing there ?
He seldom goes to church .
I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the right decision .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
No one has seen Tom .
Are you happy here ?
I think that she will not come .
It &apos;s been three days .
Let &apos;s go to my place . There &apos;s something I &apos;d like to show you .
I don &apos;t like that kind of music .
I &apos;m not done with you .
I miss her a lot .
I &apos;m not taking Tom &apos;s word for it .
You &apos;ve taken a long time eating lunch .
What &apos;re you doing today ?
Where should we meet ?
We &apos;re sorry about it .
Tom says that he wants me to go to Boston with Mary .
Don &apos;t call me so late at night .
This is very important to me .
Tom and Mary got married in a small church .
I can &apos;t believe that someone who &apos;s supposed to be my friend would say things like that about me .
I think you &apos;re in danger .
The police will find us if we stay here .
She was tired but decided on walking .
I &apos;ve come to take you home .
There is nothing to do but apologize .
I played with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary kiss him .
What did you have for lunch today ?
Tom can write well .
You aren &apos;t yourself today .
When was the last time you saw the cat ?
Tom went out to eat .
It works now .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom drunk before .
You shouldn &apos;t go .
I don &apos;t want to drink that .
You would be safe there .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
I thought you said you didn &apos;t do that kind of thing .
Tom looked young .
This is from Australia .
Where was Tom born ?
He always looked happy , but never was .
Why did he do that ?
He wanted to buy a book .
The problem is that I don &apos;t have any money .
It &apos;s cold .
Were you drunk last night ?
What did they say to you ?
She thought for a few minutes .
You must go through with your plan .
It &apos;s against the rules to smoke at the office .
Tom is coming .
Tom goes to school five days a week .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind .
Tom is listening to the radio .
Tom wants to become a teacher .
Who do you think would do such a thing ?
You should &apos;ve come to the party .
I will not be busy tomorrow .
I think you &apos;re being a little too careful .
I thought what Tom did was cute .
This is where I went to school .
They didn &apos;t know what to do first .
Everyone &apos;s watching .
Tom finished reading the book and returned it to Mary .
I &apos;ve got big hands .
Tom hasn &apos;t spoken to me about it yet .
I don &apos;t know what to make of this .
Come on !
That &apos;s just not enough .
Tom and Mary are talking .
Tom may have missed the train . He hasn &apos;t come yet .
Tom sat down and read the paper .
He must have gotten over his cold .
What time &apos;s your train ?
I was looking at her .
When did you change your address ?
I went to see Tom , but he wasn &apos;t there .
Was his story true ?
I apologize . It was my mistake .
What does Tom think about it ?
What does your father do ?
Tom only drinks coffee .
Tom sounds worried .
You shouldn &apos;t smoke so much .
It &apos;s still a little early to eat lunch .
I &apos;m a university student .
Tom said that Mary was very tired .
Today I don &apos;t feel like doing anything .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;ll rain tomorrow .
What do they think ?
Tom seldom speaks to me anymore .
Why don &apos;t you go to bed ?
She doesn &apos;t eat meat , does she ?
I &apos;m calling from Tom &apos;s .
It is very cold today .
The child cried for help .
I &apos;ve seen them .
Tom promised not to hurt Mary .
Mary thought she could change Tom .
I &apos;ll give you my car .
Your hand is as cold as ice .
I want to work in a hospital .
She likes to listen to music .
Are you going to go with Tom ?
What is it you want from me ?
Tom is going to like being in Boston .
Be careful . The soup &apos;s very hot .
I &apos;d rather go to Boston .
The teacher said , &quot; That &apos;s all for today . &quot;
Tom doesn &apos;t know who he should ask .
I can &apos;t even do that .
No one will believe me .
I can &apos;t take you to work with me .
Do you want it or not ?
Tom is going to do that for you .
I told Tom I &apos;m from Boston .
I don &apos;t ever want to speak to Tom again .
She was tired , but she kept working .
Tom has been in the hospital for three days .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy a new bicycle .
It is said that he is sick .
Tom told Mary about his new car .
Whose glasses are these ?
Not everyone is like you .
This is going to be easy .
Tom brought his son to work .
There are some books on the desk .
I &apos;ve got one like that already .
What did Tom do yesterday afternoon ?
Tom knew that Mary was hungry .
We have to do that this week .
I &apos;m busy right now , Tom .
I &apos;ll see you later .
He is eight .
Are you interested ?
I can swim .
I don &apos;t think your mother will like it .
How old is Tom ?
Tom can &apos;t see anything without his glasses .
You weren &apos;t there .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m so stupid .
Tom came with Mary .
Tom is very likely to be able to do that .
I don &apos;t know what Tom is doing .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
When are you off ?
Tom died young .
Everybody knows for a fact that he is still alive .
Are you my father ?
I saw the teacher walk across the street .
I &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t go there by yourself .
He had a book in his hand .
Tom plans to go to Boston next week .
I hope everything &apos;s going well with you .
Tom stood in front of Mary .
I can &apos;t help it .
I think Tom can do that .
Have you ever seen him swimming ?
Whose plan is it ?
I thought Tom and Mary broke up .
He is rarely in a good mood .
Tom was at the library .
Tom still didn &apos;t know what to do .
Did I win ?
You can &apos;t seem to finish anything .
I want to visit Boston , too .
I &apos;m going to call for help .
That &apos;s no reason to get angry .
This was his one and only hope .
I will never forget this .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to dance .
It &apos;s the only way to find out .
How long have you been in Boston ?
Let &apos;s just be friends .
He is not as tall as his brother .
He left the book on the table .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t know the answer .
Tom knows what it takes .
I ran to school .
They &apos;re best friends .
Give me back my book . I need it again .
This is all you have to do now .
I brought a pizza .
You did what had to be done .
You don &apos;t need to be afraid .
Tom went home on foot .
I am reading a book now .
Tom is very likely to be late .
We &apos;ve seen them .
I &apos;m not so lucky .
Tom didn &apos;t get a driver &apos;s license until he was thirty .
&quot; Where were you ? &quot; &quot; I was at a friend &apos;s house . &quot;
Are Tom and John brothers ?
He wore glasses .
You must eat .
Do you think Tom is really sorry ?
She needs it .
Do you still think it won &apos;t happen ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t seem too busy .
We have everything we need now .
When you &apos;re a father , you &apos;ll understand .
I know what I need to do .
Tom has probably already forgotten about you .
I think Tom is a student .
We can &apos;t look at that right now .
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
Tom seemed honest .
Would you like some more tea ?
Tom still speaks French every day .
Who &apos;s here ?
I intend to try .
We need to stop them .
Tom has a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
I think you &apos;re hot .
You &apos;ll like this .
Our train arrived on time .
Tom might still be living in Australia .
Take as much or as little as you &apos;d like .
It seems to me that he is honest .
I don &apos;t think I can do this alone .
What just happened here ?
I should &apos;ve been there with you .
I know how women think .
Where are you going exactly ?
We lost our cat and Tom found it for us .
He has been in Japan for three years .
Tom is probably alone in his room .
Those men are speaking French .
Tom just won .
Tom fell from the tree .
Tom made it .
There &apos;s no one left .
It &apos;s going to happen sooner or later .
Tom is going to do that again .
She showed me her new car .
He didn &apos;t get the joke .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary coming ?
I don &apos;t know for certain when he will come .
What &apos;s wrong with you , Tom ?
Get Tom something to drink .
Tom is safe now .
Why aren &apos;t you with me ?
How about a cup of coffee ?
You shouldn &apos;t drink that water .
I failed the exam .
Tom couldn &apos;t do what he was asked to do .
Tom seemed to know what he was doing .
I didn &apos;t know that your mother lived with you .
Tom decided not to go to the party .
We have seen no one .
Tom was told to go home .
Turn off the light .
Why does Tom think I &apos;m here ?
Tom probably thought I wouldn &apos;t like doing that .
I seldom speak French anymore .
Tom &apos;ll remember .
I &apos;m not sure I can swim that far .
Tom was busy .
Tom wanted to say more , but he couldn &apos;t .
This answer makes me angry .
I can &apos;t save anyone .
They could not find work at home .
I &apos;m glad of that .
You should keep your promise .
I &apos;m sorry , but I didn &apos;t know it was a secret .
We didn &apos;t talk long .
We went to the movies .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat meat anymore .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a new car .
You did this on purpose , didn &apos;t you ?
I was asked to do this .
Did you speak to Tom yesterday ?
When did Tom start working here ?
She looked lonely .
Why do you think that is ?
You &apos;ve confused the students .
Let &apos;s go and see Tom .
You &apos;re in the way .
I asked Tom where he and Mary had first met each other .
You know why I &apos;m here , don &apos;t you ?
I have the same problem .
He promised to marry her .
Tom promised me that .
That &apos;s the law .
Tom &apos;s family is in Australia .
Tom forgot Mary &apos;s address .
Tom told me you speak French .
It looks easy when you do it .
Leave that box where it is .
Have they gone ?
Tom never wears a hat .
Do you want me to tell you what Tom did ?
I know that I &apos;m fat .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
We would like to buy a sofa .
You must do it yourself .
I don &apos;t know what Tom will think .
She used to play tennis with him .
I need some sleep .
I went to Paris .
It won &apos;t be that hard .
Do you really want someone else to do it ?
No one else could do my work .
I do not know whether it is good or not .
This isn &apos;t a hospital .
How &apos;s it going at school ?
You never told me you had a sister .
I &apos;ve just arrived at the airport .
Would you like some more bread ?
I can be there in ten minutes .
We &apos;ll be there in less than three hours .
I know what you want to do .
I think I understand you .
Is this all we need ?
You don &apos;t have to eat .
Tom knows a girl who can speak French quite well .
Your letter made me happy .
Did you phone me ?
Where did Tom work ?
I had no idea you couldn &apos;t speak French .
I like sugar .
You should &apos;ve gone home already .
Tom does have to do that .
It looks like Tom is shy .
I &apos;m not satisfied .
This is a picture of my car .
Tom dropped his suitcase and ran away .
I don &apos;t want to talk about school .
I want to be with you more than anything .
She called me up from Tokyo .
I wish I were as young as you .
I don &apos;t remember who gave me this .
It &apos;s really cold today .
I think I &apos;m love with you .
Tom is interested in golf .
Just say what you want to say .
I don &apos;t have the time to help you right now .
Tom needs new clothes .
Tom wouldn &apos;t talk to Mary .
Tom can do all that and more .
We used to talk about our future .
His speech impressed us very much .
I &apos;ve been shopping with Tom .
I thought it was pretty good .
I don &apos;t know when Tom and Mary met .
When did they leave ?
Tom shut one window and Mary shut the other .
My brother is very tall .
I think it makes sense .
Do you have any idea what &apos;s wrong ?
Have you done this kind of thing before ?
Tom said that Mary shouldn &apos;t have walked home alone .
She advised him to go to the hospital .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I didn &apos;t mean it that way .
Mary makes more money than her husband .
I have to answer this letter right away .
His daughter has become a beautiful woman .
Tom said he thought it could happen in Boston , too .
I &apos;m good at soccer .
He doesn &apos;t eat anything except fruit .
Tom was never really in love with Mary .
She seems happy .
Aren &apos;t you going to go with me ?
What &apos;s your mother like ?
Where is the library ?
We &apos;ll deal with that later .
They should ask Tom first .
These books are mine and those books are his .
I &apos;ve been here for three days .
If you don &apos;t want to talk to me , you don &apos;t have to .
They are very big apples .
I &apos;m happy to do this for you .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French very well .
I tell you the truth .
Tom and Mary are still just kids .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you some day .
I was a little afraid .
I think those are Tom &apos;s .
Tom looked at me like I was crazy .
That was the moment of truth .
I &apos;m not sure he wants to talk to me .
How did they know ?
I want to sing the song .
Give up smoking if you want to live long .
I &apos;ve been trying to call Tom all day .
I am in Tokyo today .
Have you read all of these books ?
I thought Tom was meeting us here .
People change . There &apos;s not much you can do about it .
Tom asked me to help him .
I &apos;m not buying your story .
I met her by chance in the library .
You can wait for me here .
I have waited a full three hours .
She is helping him .
I know Tom isn &apos;t a Canadian .
I can &apos;t think straight .
The boy has learned to read .
Tom didn &apos;t know that .
I feel really good now .
What &apos;s Tom look like ?
What &apos;s the plan , Tom ?
Has Tom found his keys yet ?
I wouldn &apos;t want to die here .
Tom never keeps his word .
Let us do our job .
I knew it .
Why do you want Tom to do that ?
My glass is full .
I wonder whether Tom likes me .
I &apos;m not going to see you again .
Tom could hardly hear what Mary was saying .
Tom , what are you doing here ?
This is very easy .
Tom can get it .
I &apos;m alone now .
I don &apos;t think that Tom is happy .
Tom would &apos;ve helped you .
I can &apos;t drive a bus .
What were you doing up there ?
I &apos;m not old .
She loves us .
Aren &apos;t you happy here ?
I &apos;m not sure why I &apos;m here .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to church very often .
Did you hear the news on the radio this morning ?
What are you going to do there ?
That man was born lucky .
Who found her ?
Go get some water .
Where can I find the milk ?
I found it .
You may not want to know .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
I want Tom to be here for Christmas .
I heard her sing a song .
Tom probably went swimming yesterday .
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think so .
I wish I could run as fast as Tom .
Don &apos;t go yet .
You can bank on that .
Do whatever you think is best .
I came here to do that with Tom .
I &apos;m never too busy for you .
We need to have a contract .
I &apos;ll let you know in a day or so .
I &apos;ve never done it before .
I hate losing money .
How long were you at the party ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need a lawyer .
Tom pretended that he was sick .
Tom and I are like brothers .
I now finally understand what Tom was trying to tell me .
Tom has three children to support .
He did not speak at all .
Tom plays the piano very well .
She kept working .
I don &apos;t know why I keep doing that .
Mary said that she loved me , but I didn &apos;t believe her .
To me , it is important .
He made a speech in English at the meeting .
How late is it ?
I get the point .
Tom knows how to make money .
We &apos;ve got less than an hour .
Who am I talking with ?
When I came home , Tom was watching TV .
The baby fell asleep .
Tom wasn &apos;t invited .
What Tom does is his own business .
Take some money just in case you need it .
I get lonely at times .
I finally understand .
I asked if I really needed to do that by myself .
Did she say it ?
You can &apos;t stop now .
There &apos;s got to be something you can do .
Who would have thought back then that Tom had only seven years to live ?
I found the story interesting .
I think Tom wants something to eat .
We &apos;re Tom &apos;s parents .
Do you like any of these pictures ?
I saw Tom in the library yesterday .
I don &apos;t have a house anymore .
I don &apos;t want to give up .
How do I get out of here ?
You have to believe me .
Tom is the one who told me who to give it to .
Come here . I need to tell you something .
I think you &apos;ll want to see this .
What has become of him ?
Everybody had a hard time .
I wonder why Tom went and did something like that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how tall Mary is .
He had to work hard day and night .
I &apos;m going back to America .
Tom told Mary a joke .
Maybe Tom knows something .
Tom and Mary are no longer together .
Tom was glad that Mary was home with the children .
I want to find Tom .
Tom refused to go to the hospital .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why .
Tom is older than I am .
I don &apos;t like big dogs .
Mary isn &apos;t as beautiful as Alice .
I know Tom won &apos;t tell Mary .
I think I missed something .
Tom had no plan at all .
I can &apos;t remember her name .
She watched him eat .
Tom seems to like talking about himself .
Tom knew what kind of woman Mary was .
Tom began to learn French .
Are you going to see Tom ?
I know it &apos;s in the apartment , but I can &apos;t find it .
Tom has been like a father to me .
She can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I didn &apos;t need to tell him .
Tom is a student , isn &apos;t he ?
I think Tom is going to win .
I love ice cream .
Tom is the only one who can help you do that .
When were you in Boston ?
Why do you want this job ?
I don &apos;t have enough time to eat lunch today .
I &apos;m really happy that we won .
Tom has friends .
Leave this to me .
Tell them the truth .
I don &apos;t need it .
Tom told Mary that she could do whatever she liked .
Tom talked in his sleep .
Tom is much taller than you .
Tom doesn &apos;t ever speak French anymore .
She is not less beautiful than her sister .
My father is still ill in bed .
She is getting on .
I &apos;ve done it before .
Everyone seems to be hungry but me .
My father used to say that time is money .
All I know is that he came from China .
I hope to see you soon .
I don &apos;t think that Mary is as pretty as Alice .
Why did Tom buy that ?
How many hours are left ?
Do you want me to go with you ?
I wish I didn &apos;t have to work .
Do you want to go to Boston ?
Why am I not surprised ?
There &apos;s something I need to ask you .
I &apos;ve said all I have to say .
The Japanese eat rice at least once a day .
I worked all this week .
I had no idea you were in here in Boston .
What did you say ? I can &apos;t hear you .
I &apos;d like to sing a song .
Don &apos;t you think I know that ?
I don &apos;t ever want to see you again .
Can I pay later ?
Tom sold us out .
I &apos;ll try harder .
It was not always this way .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice wasn &apos;t beautiful .
No one knows his real name .
I &apos;m not going to stay here with you .
Tom is going to love doing that .
She always keeps her room clean .
I want to run .
Tom doesn &apos;t like this .
Tom is crazy about Mary .
Have you made up your mind to come with me ?
I thought you said your car was stolen .
Give Tom a drink .
He says he will come .
I &apos;ve never met her .
I bought it yesterday .
Do you think people will make fun of me ?
Do you have an explanation ?
Let &apos;s start tonight .
I don &apos;t know what that thing is .
They &apos;re rich .
I &apos;d like to go abroad one day .
Tom turned down the offer .
Why isn &apos;t Tom helping ?
I agreed to the proposal .
How long was Tom married ?
He doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
I hate girls like that .
Tom wants this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about a thing . Mary will take care of everything .
I helped Tom a little bit .
Tom broke in .
Tom did everything he could to help Mary .
Who do you think goes there ?
Is that coffee ?
We have all the time in the world .
All Tom does is eat .
Will it hurt a lot ?
Are we safe here ?
Where did you two meet ?
I &apos;ll show you my new car .
I like both .
Do both of you have the same opinion ?
I &apos;m already tired .
Tom bought a camera for me .
I think you &apos;d better leave now .
I promised my parents I wouldn &apos;t drink .
That &apos;s how I know .
Mary is the love of my life .
Tom promised Mary that he would never see Alice again .
I don &apos;t know what Tom promised .
You missed Tom by about three hours .
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake .
Where do you live ?
We have work to do .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s car ?
I know Tom is in Boston .
Tom still can &apos;t speak French very well .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know a thing about it .
He left his wife .
I don &apos;t know him .
I couldn &apos;t speak French .
We &apos;ll do it this way from now on .
I was a little surprised .
So far , so good .
That &apos;s how I would do it .
Tell me what to do with it .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mother .
Nobody did anything .
Your plan is a good one , but mine is a better one .
Are we going for a walk ?
It &apos;s about time I was going home .
At home , we only speak French .
That is all right .
How long do we stop here ?
What advice did Tom give you ?
We &apos;re not like that .
Tom is not very good at French .
He will be missed .
You may not have to go .
What &apos;s Tom going to do with it ?
Can I go ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever seen Tom do that .
I think Tom isn &apos;t going to do that today .
It &apos;s the only way .
This telephone doesn &apos;t work .
We &apos;ve found it .
Tom doesn &apos;t get out of the city much .
That isn &apos;t likely to be a problem .
Would you like to go for a swim with me ?
I think Tom is too old for Mary .
Your things are all here .
Why did Tom kill Mary ?
We have to stop this .
I asked Tom a few questions .
I hope it won &apos;t rain this afternoon .
If Tom isn &apos;t here by 2 : 30 , he probably won &apos;t come at all .
Are you sure we &apos;re allowed to do that ?
Is that what you said ?
Would you really do that for me ?
I have too many things on my mind these days .
Stop it .
What you did was wrong .
What time is the last train ?
There are few mistakes in your report .
I &apos;m here for you , Tom .
Tom can &apos;t stay long .
I went to bed very late .
It &apos;s much too dangerous here .
Tom is no longer my friend .
Were you at home last night ?
Tom says he saw Mary .
I don &apos;t think that this is Tom &apos;s umbrella .
Tom will probably come tomorrow .
He told me not to drive too fast .
I &apos;ve been waiting here for three hours .
I still don &apos;t know .
She bought him a camera .
Tom is liked by everyone .
You &apos;ll love it .
I can &apos;t believe how beautiful you are .
I had something else in mind .
I know the person that you came with .
We visited Tom .
Tom lost Mary .
No one I know knows how to do that .
I &apos;m no longer married to Tom .
It &apos;s only me .
What is it you want to know ?
I want to go and see Tom .
Tom already has plans for Monday .
Tom looks healthy .
Where would I find books ?
Don &apos;t pick up that phone .
Do you want to know his name ?
You &apos;re out of order .
It &apos;s too big .
I &apos;ll go swimming tomorrow .
I would like that .
Do you know how deep the water is ?
When does it arrive ?
He will come tomorrow .
I will arrive in four hours .
Take an umbrella with you .
We &apos;re not going there .
I had a feeling you were going to say that .
I want to know who told Tom that .
I heard you say that this morning .
This is Tom &apos;s school .
I &apos;m really confused .
No one will be fired .
Today , I &apos;m finally going to tell Tom what I really think of him .
I was born in America .
I &apos;m studying French .
I know I love you .
I think you &apos;re going to like Tom .
Tom looked through the small window in the door .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t likely to do that .
I wasn &apos;t drunk .
I &apos;ve been saying that all along .
We have lost sight of him .
Tom said you lived in Boston .
You can &apos;t say I didn &apos;t try .
She wore glasses .
Tom said that he bought an old car .
Yesterday was hot .
Go up these stairs .
Nobody knows where Tom went .
Tom will speak .
I &apos;m really not supposed to do this .
I said don &apos;t do that .
Did you eat too much ?
Tom is home now .
I wonder what made Tom think I wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
Are those yours ?
You may swim now .
I don &apos;t want to think about what could have happened .
Tom is scared of Mary .
Tom was supposed to be here by 2 : 30 .
Have you read the book yet ?
What does Tom think of Mary ?
He fell off the horse .
I &apos;m sorry I got you in trouble .
Keep an eye on my bag for a while .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
This river is dangerous for children to swim in .
I &apos;ll let you know .
Tom put the children to bed .
I want to speak to Tom .
I saw it , too .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know who he should ask to help him .
There has got to be an explanation .
I think we did a good job .
That one &apos;s OK .
It has nothing to do with you .
Is Tom still mad ?
Is this the train for Boston ?
I read this in the newspaper .
Tom has to stop doing that .
He is able to speak ten languages .
It &apos;s not so bad here .
Where &apos;s your key ?
I stopped going there .
This box is heavy .
What &apos;s your explanation ?
What do you think of the new teacher ?
They aren &apos;t mine .
I &apos;m not well .
May I call you Tom ?
That &apos;s our train .
I can &apos;t go to school today . I &apos;m sick .
When do you need it by ?
No one lives in that building anymore .
That &apos;s what Tom does .
Let &apos;s wait until Monday .
I bought a new car .
I &apos;ll never do it again .
I don &apos;t think we were seen .
What kind of person is Tom ?
Tom walked past the table where Mary was sitting .
I almost forgot my passport .
Let &apos;s have lunch .
Tom &apos;s young .
What happened to you yesterday ?
He can hardly speak .
Is Tom the one who told you that ?
I thought Tom wasn &apos;t at home .
Tom will be giving a speech today .
What time do you open ?
He took back everything he said .
I want you to be happy .
Tom threw the phone against the wall .
This must be my book .
We talked .
Tom doesn &apos;t find this as funny as Mary does .
How did you know where to find me ?
This probably means war .
My sister married a doctor .
Her sister I like very much , but her brother I do not like .
She asked me to open the window .
He seldom comes to see me .
The weather is bad today .
I want to thank you , Tom .
I told Tom myself .
She gave him a present .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t yet know why Mary wants to do that .
We hardly even talk anymore .
That man has one box .
How did she tell them ?
It &apos;s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all .
Don &apos;t you want to know why I didn &apos;t do that ?
You have no idea , do you ?
Tom speaks French .
She knew something was wrong .
Tom is hardly ever at home .
I already feel better .
Tom said that he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself .
If you tell people what they want to hear , they &apos;ll do what you want .
Tom bought himself a new guitar for Christmas .
I want you to help Tom .
I don &apos;t want to eat anything .
It &apos;s very warm today .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
I wish you would &apos;ve stayed home .
We have to get at the truth of the matter .
Tom was very drunk .
I hope you &apos;ve learned something from your mistake .
It &apos;s difficult to please Tom .
I &apos;ll get in touch with you next week .
I looked around , but saw nobody .
I could barely speak .
There &apos;s something I need to say to you .
He was about to start .
I thought you were happy here .
You can always sleep on my couch .
Let &apos;s see what Tom has to say about Mary &apos;s plan .
No one should ever have to do that .
Tom had a good reason .
Tom just bought a car , too .
This has got to stop .
Don &apos;t stop .
Did you really expect him to tell you the truth ?
I promised Tom I &apos;d wait .
She said that I should quit smoking .
It takes time .
Tom is better .
I feel cold . Would you shut the window , please ?
Those who know him like him .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all live in Australia .
He &apos;s worried that he might be late .
How did you convince them ?
I had my watch stolen .
I want to quit .
I &apos;d better go now .
What are these doing here ?
I &apos;m the only one other than Tom who knows how to fix this .
I should &apos;ve stayed at home today .
I can not bear this noise any more .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re pleased .
Did you find a job ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want it , does he ?
That car is Tom &apos;s .
If I were in her place , I wouldn &apos;t give up yet .
We did the best we could .
What a beautiful baby !
How long are you in town , Tom ?
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s problem now .
This isn &apos;t my money .
That &apos;s all for today .
What made you say that ?
It was good news .
It &apos;s cold in here .
Who doesn &apos;t like the beach ?
I &apos;ll get Tom for you .
Tom already knows the truth .
Tom helped me do my homework .
He did it right away .
I don &apos;t understand why you want to do that .
Tom is likely to win this game .
Someone entered the room .
Tom stopped dancing .
Tom put out the fire .
Tom isn &apos;t going to see Mary again .
I should have done this weeks ago .
Tom has asked Mary not to do anything .
How are things going with Tom ?
I don &apos;t care what you do with your money .
We want to have a baby .
Mary spoke Japanese slowly .
We want out of here .
I am crazy about golf .
There &apos;s no reason to be afraid .
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
I had to buy some food .
This book is easy to read .
This job is too much for me .
I &apos;m very proud of my daughter .
I &apos;m getting nervous .
There used to be a bridge here .
Take care .
Tom is prepared to help us .
I already told you that .
Can I see your license , please ?
I don &apos;t think Tom knows exactly how that happened .
Tom hates everybody .
I want the money .
You look very happy .
My friends won &apos;t talk to me anymore .
I don &apos;t have enough money yet .
Just do what you usually do .
Let &apos;s get together tomorrow .
This is too expensive .
You were never alone .
I &apos;m finished with you .
Tom told Mary not to trust John .
I &apos;ve already been working here for a few months .
Does Tom have it ?
It would be nice if I could travel to Japan .
Tom isn &apos;t that crazy .
Her story was not interesting .
I &apos;ll help Tom .
We were all asleep .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will agree to go or not .
They came here one after another .
I often read books .
I have to go to Boston .
Can we help you ?
Here &apos;s my passport .
If you want to pass the exam , you need to study .
When will it begin ?
I &apos;m sorry , Tom . I can &apos;t do it .
We must sleep outside today .
Tom , I have something to tell you .
It &apos;s not a secret anymore .
My children are hungry .
I saw it with my own eyes .
We have to wait for him .
The room was cold .
Tom is going to love that .
You almost died .
We &apos;re very disappointed .
He told everybody at school .
Is my French really so bad ?
I didn &apos;t think that was any fun .
He said , &quot; So long , my friends , &quot; and left us .
If I &apos;d had a little more money , I would have bought it .
Are they Japanese ?
We &apos;re not sure if she &apos;s right .
Tom and I already know each other .
I &apos;m sure that he &apos;ll come on time .
I wonder who &apos;s going to be at the party .
Go on home .
Is everything ready now ?
I wish I &apos;d never asked you that question .
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying .
It is not because I hate him , but because I love him .
Are you sure you want to be alone ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look too well .
Tom says you should always tell the truth .
It seems Tom &apos;s in love with me .
Tom broke up with me .
Go somewhere else .
Tom is working on your car .
I &apos;m not the enemy .
I know about Tom and Mary .
It &apos;s hot .
I don &apos;t want to come back here ever again .
Tom has just come home .
He was really impressed .
Why isn &apos;t it good ?
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary does .
It was a beautiful night .
Don &apos;t listen to that man .
This is my desk .
This isn &apos;t my first time to be here .
It might be a long time before you see me again .
I should &apos;ve known Tom had something to do with it .
I &apos;m going to take this home .
Tom can &apos;t find a job .
I already spoke to Tom .
The accident happened two hours ago .
You weren &apos;t that bad .
He comes here every three days .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something .
That &apos;s your decision .
It &apos;s necessary for you to go .
I was very impressed by Tom &apos;s speech .
Please get whatever you like .
Tom moved to Boston .
Tom gave up all hope .
I know what &apos;s good for you .
I am sure .
I &apos;ve been living in this house since last month .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know you .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
There used to be a large park here .
How do we stop Tom ?
Don &apos;t you like girls ?
Who found you ?
Do you have enough food ?
What do you know about Tom &apos;s family ?
Tom is planning to eat dinner with Mary tonight .
It &apos;s not from me .
I don &apos;t want to ever speak to you again .
May I smoke ?
I &apos;m not afraid of the future .
I have been loved .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston longer .
Is it hot ?
Do I have to wear a tie at work ?
I don &apos;t want to name names .
Tom pulled Mary out of the car .
Everyone was hungry .
When do you usually eat lunch ?
Are you still together ?
We &apos;ve been together for three years .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom is gone .
Tom isn &apos;t exactly welcome here .
Tom isn &apos;t going to want Mary to do that .
You shouldn &apos;t have come alone .
You look younger .
He stayed in the hotel .
I don &apos;t want to visit Tom .
That &apos;s no good , Tom .
I &apos;ve lost my bag .
This river is deep enough to swim in .
Tom loved running .
I heard that Tom used to live in Boston .
We &apos;re almost out of sugar .
You &apos;re way too late .
Tom can &apos;t be sick .
We play tennis every day .
Is Tom really a student here ?
That &apos;ll make Tom very happy .
The meeting took place yesterday .
How does Tom know that ?
When did he arrive here ?
I &apos;ve never had to do anything like this before .
I &apos;m thinking about it .
I want you to be my friend again .
Did Tom go home ?
No one knows where Tom has gone .
You &apos;re so good at singing .
Tom probably died .
Tom played tennis .
What makes you happy ?
They must be dead .
I am six feet tall .
Are you still angry with me ?
I want to see your house .
I &apos;ll get this to Tom .
I feel sorry for him .
How is your sister ?
She loved me in the same way that I loved her .
She opened the door .
I can &apos;t explain it either .
Tom said Mary is very tired .
It &apos;s OK .
Is everything OK at the office ?
I heard that he was very rich .
That &apos;s all Tom wants .
I wonder why you would say something like that to me .
Tom says he &apos;s in love with Mary .
I don &apos;t understand what you are saying .
How cold is it ?
There it is .
You &apos;d better go .
Tom was at home alone .
Tom moved out of his parents &apos; place .
Tom had no idea where Mary went .
We &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
Do you know what that guy &apos;s name is ?
I &apos;m not finished .
He showed her the way .
We &apos;ll make it .
Maybe we can talk about that later .
I wonder what goes on inside Tom &apos;s head .
Was Tom with Mary ?
Are Tom and Mary really friends ?
I can &apos;t eat the apple .
We aren &apos;t that poor .
She is not old enough to travel abroad by herself .
The boy playing the guitar is my brother .
This has never happened before .
I would often take a walk before breakfast .
You seem to know me , but I don &apos;t know you .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand me the way you do .
Please tell me it &apos;s a joke .
Do you know that I &apos;m in love with you ?
You don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s home is , do you ?
What does it say ?
I &apos;m down here .
I don &apos;t mind doing it .
Tom is shy .
Tom is coming to Boston .
My book is on your desk .
He makes three times more money than I do .
I really don &apos;t know Tom that well .
I hate people who say that .
You know it better than me .
I thought Tom was guilty .
Tom now lives in Australia .
Nobody was listening to the speech .
It seemed like a good idea .
I can &apos;t live without you .
He may have missed the last train .
Tom won &apos;t think that &apos;s funny .
I love you , Tom .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Where did he find the money ?
The train station will be closed from tomorrow .
We &apos;ve spoken to each other before .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
I didn &apos;t know who else to ask .
How are you going to spend your weekend ?
I will deal with him myself .
Nobody can love him .
Did Tom like it in Boston ?
We got to the station at six .
I can &apos;t believe Tom said that .
Don &apos;t forget Tom .
Tom and Mary know each other , but they &apos;re not really friends .
How could I help you ?
My uncle gave me a camera .
Tom has arrived .
I &apos;m going to take tomorrow off .
I own this car .
What &apos;s taking Tom so long ?
I never read in bed .
The message was in French .
Is this book yours ?
I don &apos;t much feel like working these days .
We all just want to be loved .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s brother .
I &apos;m going to take my car .
This is the girl that came yesterday .
We &apos;ll go see Tom .
I &apos;ll see you in there .
I believed what Tom said .
We went without him because he wasn &apos;t ready .
How many books does he have ?
All children do not like apples .
Put your hands against the wall .
I &apos;m as old as Tom .
Does Tom get into the city very often ?
It &apos;s a dictionary .
He wrote a book about China .
I &apos;m doing what I think is right .
That &apos;s my line !
Tom is walking his dog .
Let &apos;s be friends .
Did Tom go to the concert last Monday ?
His advice didn &apos;t help at all .
Someone might see us .
Why don &apos;t you believe me ?
Tom is very busy now .
I want Tom here .
Tom can run faster than I can .
Mary came up to me when she saw me .
What else did you buy ?
What don &apos;t I understand ?
Is it true that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s sister ?
Tom was up late last night studying .
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him .
Your secret will be safe with me .
Tom is going to miss Mary .
Is that your new girlfriend ?
Let &apos;s see what will happen .
What were you doing about this time yesterday ?
I &apos;m glad you brought this up .
He and I are brothers .
It &apos;s not like that .
Tom couldn &apos;t convince Mary .
Tom held the gun to Mary &apos;s head .
I left your book in the car .
Tom didn &apos;t understand a thing .
We trust him .
I don &apos;t understand women .
Was Tom surprised ?
I never want to talk to you again .
Tom doesn &apos;t like the way Mary talks .
May I trouble you for the salt ?
You think I &apos;m crazy , don &apos;t you ?
They won that game .
The book is red .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat , does he ?
The doctor arrived in time to save her .
I &apos;ve already told you what I think .
They weren &apos;t impressed .
She &apos;s not my type .
We expected that to happen .
He is my teacher .
This bus will take you to the station .
You know me well enough to know I wouldn &apos;t do something like that .
Leave me some ice cream .
What does Tom have ?
It looks like Tom got what he wanted .
You didn &apos;t tell me Tom speaks French .
There &apos;s no hope .
We are a family .
We must work faster .
I am in the classroom .
We should go inside the house .
Tom is not our man .
She speaks too much .
He may not come .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to tell Tom .
It &apos;s interesting .
Tom is much older than Mary .
Tom is very cute .
I like wine .
They &apos;re about to go .
I would like to hear your opinion .
Isn &apos;t that the truth ?
I thought you said you were going to be working today .
Some children are swimming in the sea .
What has Tom ever done for me ?
Our company has a long , long history .
Tom asked Mary to be quiet .
I know who lives in this house .
Tom wore a new coat to school today .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French well .
I &apos;ll never change my mind .
Why don &apos;t we eat at a restaurant tonight ?
Tom does that , too .
Nobody saw Tom .
He asked me if I was busy .
You have my word on it .
I go to school because I want to learn .
Tom left the window open .
What do you have in mind ?
Did you give Tom something to eat ?
Tom didn &apos;t drive .
Tom will go in your place .
Do you like me , too ?
It &apos;s always like that .
That was then and this is now .
I &apos;m not used to this .
We &apos;re ready , I think .
We &apos;re going to wait until Tom gets here .
I am free this afternoon .
The two of them got back together .
You &apos;re so right .
Are you scared ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like Tom .
It may well be true .
This car looks like mine .
I don &apos;t have time to say this twice , so listen carefully .
I have nothing else to lose .
I don &apos;t like what you &apos;re saying .
Can we talk about this later ?
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t hear you .
Tom came home drunk .
Leave it off the list .
Please give me this book .
He could not swim .
You &apos;re like Tom .
I have a lot of work to do .
Where will we eat ?
Tom couldn &apos;t see anything .
How cute !
Now that you are no longer young , you must think of your future .
I told Tom I would do my best .
What can you give me ?
Why don &apos;t we ask his advice ?
I wouldn &apos;t be too sure if I were you .
The boy tried to be a man and not cry .
Tom was alone .
Tom tried to save Mary &apos;s life .
I &apos;ll work alone .
I think you &apos;re both right .
I am seeing a friend tomorrow .
What &apos;ll you drink ?
Tom asked for my help .
Isn &apos;t life beautiful ?
That &apos;s not what we want .
Don &apos;t look at it .
Tom , this is Mary &apos;s brother John .
You don &apos;t even know where you are .
It &apos;s far too dangerous .
It &apos;s too dark .
We had a very hot summer this year .
Perhaps Tom can borrow some money from Mary .
May I ask a couple of questions ?
Do you think Tom will visit us next summer ?
This happened before .
My family means everything to me .
Tom just doesn &apos;t understand .
I didn &apos;t tell Tom anything .
Here &apos;s where they usually have dinner .
I &apos;ve never had to go there before .
I have to do this before class .
He was so poor that he couldn &apos;t buy bread .
Do your best in everything .
Tom shut himself up in his room .
Everything in this room needs to be sold .
I &apos;ll take you there .
In that case , I &apos;ll change my mind .
My mother told me why my father was so angry with me .
Tom got back in his car and drove away .
I just wanted to let you know I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
I know how busy Tom is .
Isn &apos;t Tom your brother ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go .
I &apos;m happy to be here again .
I want a good dictionary .
How is Tom going to Boston ?
Are you dead ?
How far is it from here to the sea ?
I don &apos;t want to talk about my family .
I &apos;ve never told anyone .
He started singing .
I think we had better wait for another 30 minutes .
Tom doesn &apos;t know he shouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
I told Tom not to come .
We can &apos;t see each other again .
Tom didn &apos;t give me a chance to explain what I meant .
I didn &apos;t ask for help .
I have to change .
Tom didn &apos;t like my idea .
If you have hope , anything can come true .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
I &apos;m sorry , but Tom isn &apos;t home .
When can I call you ?
You are very kind to show me the way .
It is just half past seven .
Do you know what this is ?
I &apos;ll always love Tom .
Tom is already waiting .
My father bought me the book .
I think it &apos;s worth a try .
He still loves her .
Are you happy with this ?
Tom wants to stop us .
I want to see Tom again .
Can you guess her age ?
My father is as busy as ever .
Tom refused to leave .
We were like brothers .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all live in Boston .
It &apos;s too easy .
Tom said that he thought that he should learn how to do that .
Could you please stop saying that ?
The baby is still sleeping .
Does Tom do that for money ?
Why weren &apos;t we told the truth ?
Who is in this room ?
Every boy here has a girlfriend .
I let Tom in the house .
Who can that be ?
I &apos;m very shy .
I didn &apos;t sleep on the plane .
They accept students like Tom .
Excuse me , but I think this is my seat .
I can &apos;t believe that you enjoyed that movie .
She works very hard .
Tom must &apos;ve left the water running .
She didn &apos;t show up at the party , but nobody knows why .
Tom gave Mary something that she needed .
You don &apos;t speak English , do you ?
Have you eaten ?
May I go first ?
She wrote a book about animals .
Maybe I should go help Tom .
I &apos;m looking for you .
I thought it was funny , too .
I will let you go home at once .
Why don &apos;t you say something ?
I see what you &apos;re doing .
He speaks English .
Tom couldn &apos;t play the guitar .
I didn &apos;t know you were so good at French .
Give me that money .
I &apos;m hungry now .
As I told you earlier , I can &apos;t help you .
You &apos;re just in time for dinner .
I know Tom is tired .
You have made many mistakes .
I kept on reading .
Why is she here ?
Tom is just a friend , not my boyfriend .
I have to say this .
Where could he be ?
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
I don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
Why &apos;s Tom staying in Boston ?
Tom also speaks French .
Everybody was looking for Tom .
Leave my things alone .
He is almost always at home .
What did those two men want from you ?
Can I speak with you a moment ?
How could Tom know ?
Why is Tom not doing that ?
Do you want to eat anything ?
How about your place ?
I didn &apos;t like Boston at all .
If you have a minute , you might want to read this .
Let &apos;s keep an eye on this .
I really , really want this .
I don &apos;t think I want to know .
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school here anymore .
Let &apos;s leave the room .
That &apos;s good , too .
He saw the girl .
Tom sat down next to his brother .
Are you and Tom friends ?
I am leaving the books here .
May I ask a question ?
Tell everybody .
What do you expect me to do ?
He put the key on the desk as usual .
We help Tom .
She &apos;s rather good .
How is your cold ?
We arrived first .
Why is Tom going to Boston ?
Don &apos;t take things too seriously .
We &apos;re crazy about each other .
Let &apos;s meet in front of the hotel .
No one has seen Tom for years .
We have a lot of things we need to do .
How did the party go ?
I should go to Boston .
I have been in Paris .
He is sometimes absent from school .
If you really want to know , all you need to do is ask .
When are you going to talk to Tom about that ?
I want to understand Tom .
I &apos;m happy with that .
Why don &apos;t you go and have a look ?
This is the camera which I bought yesterday .
Tom is disappointed .
Tom would like to have stayed for dinner , but he had to go back to work .
That &apos;s what makes me happy .
Tom came home very late last night .
I have a job for you .
I love him more than anything .
He laughed at me .
He still lives with his parents .
Did you call Tom ?
You don &apos;t look all that happy .
Don &apos;t bother seeing me to the door .
I &apos;m not getting this .
I have nothing to do this afternoon .
Tom said that he &apos;d be right back .
Why don &apos;t you come dancing with me ?
They meet once a week .
You need friends .
I don &apos;t know that .
Tom took a look at what Mary had written .
This is my mother &apos;s computer .
How did Tom get to be so rich ?
I didn &apos;t want to come , but I had no choice .
Tom is in Australia , but Mary isn &apos;t .
I &apos;m going to sell my house .
What don &apos;t you like about school ?
What I &apos;m saying is quite true .
I played tennis after I studied .
I like playing golf .
There &apos;s a dog by the door .
I don &apos;t know how Tom does it .
Tom and Mary will get married sooner or later .
Tom will like this place .
I have to talk to you about Tom .
I don &apos;t have any other choice .
Tom was very tired and fell asleep during the meeting .
I thought you went home .
I &apos;d love to , but I can &apos;t .
Tom knows some of Mary &apos;s friends .
What I have to tell you is very important .
Tom is correct .
Don &apos;t you want to stay here with us ?
You don &apos;t like it , do you ?
I &apos;ve never been to Paris .
Tom seems to know a lot about me .
Please don &apos;t call me that .
No one was alive .
I can play tennis .
&quot; Will it rain ? &quot; &quot; I hope not . &quot;
I love her so much that I can &apos;t leave her .
You &apos;re angry , aren &apos;t you ?
Everyone knows you &apos;re in love with Tom .
Tom went swimming with his friends .
Don &apos;t call me again .
You can call me when you want .
Please hurry ! Tom is waiting .
You need me more than I need you .
I want to tell Mary I love her .
Tom can drive now .
My wife looked surprised .
I &apos;d like to spend some time with Tom .
I &apos;m sure Tom wouldn &apos;t be mad at Mary if there weren &apos;t a good reason to be .
Tom wanted to dance with Mary .
I &apos;ve come to save Tom .
I see what the problem is .
Did Tom tell you why he wasn &apos;t at school yesterday ?
It can &apos;t be that bad .
Tom left Boston .
When do we have to do that ?
I think I have the best job in the world .
Go to bed . It &apos;s a school night .
She slowly closed her eyes .
Tom has a daughter who &apos;s very beautiful .
Have you finished yet ?
They got married .
Tom failed to keep his promise .
That &apos;s from Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
Here comes the train .
I &apos;ve never heard Tom say anything like that .
We just got started .
I &apos;m just looking for Tom .
Where &apos;s Tom ?
Why did you decide to study English ?
I don &apos;t remember asking for your opinion .
Where did you send Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t run .
Can we talk to Tom ?
My father went to China .
She may have known the answer .
You know what it &apos;s like .
Call me back .
My father isn &apos;t home yet .
I don &apos;t care if you believe me .
I saw her swim .
I heard her singing .
Tom didn &apos;t waste any time .
Tom never found out the truth .
Let us never speak of this again .
I &apos;m tired of being sick .
Tom tried to answer the question .
I &apos;ve been married twice .
You still have a lot to learn .
I must speak with you alone .
Why didn &apos;t you call me last night ?
The station is not far from here .
I &apos;m busy today .
Tom &apos;s confused .
I was the one who taught Tom how to read .
That doesn &apos;t look too hard .
I wish I had more time to talk to you .
I &apos;m going to miss you .
Do you like writing ?
We &apos;d better call the doctor .
He comes here once a month .
I &apos;m sure Tom wouldn &apos;t mind doing that .
I thought Tom said he didn &apos;t want to get married .
We know we &apos;ve got big problems .
Hey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Why are you so happy ?
My father is home .
He is Japanese .
This book is very small .
I would like to see you again some day .
I hope you feel better tomorrow .
Please call him .
I can &apos;t live in this house anymore .
I want to leave school .
Tom is going to Boston on Monday .
She had nothing to do yesterday .
Look behind you .
Tom was often late for school .
I may be able to help you .
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday .
Tom came to Boston with me .
How far away are we ?
You should &apos;ve let me sing .
Tom knows French .
Where do we go after this ?
I knew something Tom didn &apos;t know .
Did they say what happened ?
Why isn &apos;t Tom asleep ?
I &apos;ll do my best .
I wish Tom was here with us today .
The girl did not say anything .
I love this park .
Let &apos;s sing and dance .
Tom and Mary are talking to John .
Tom went home by taxi .
My uncle comes back from America next Monday .
They are having lunch in the garden .
Tom is standing in the garden .
You need to work very hard .
I &apos;ve got to get Tom home .
Go get your car .
Nobody will know .
I don &apos;t understand this word .
He looked up the word in the dictionary .
It &apos;s not funny .
Tom isn &apos;t scared anymore .
He told me to do it , so I did it .
There &apos;s nothing I wouldn &apos;t do for you .
I need you .
This room is too small for us .
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to me .
This makes no sense .
Tom isn &apos;t that much younger than Mary .
I don &apos;t know what has become of the boy .
Everybody knows his name .
Tom and Mary were both busy .
You &apos;ll be happy .
These girls are in trouble .
Tom is very close to Mary .
You &apos;ll see Tom .
What do you think I want ?
I &apos;m really proud of you .
Tom forgot his wife &apos;s birthday .
Let me do this .
We can do nothing about it .
I don &apos;t think you tried hard enough .
There &apos;s one other thing we need to buy .
Do you have a computer at home ?
I think that Tom lives somewhere around here .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t eat out as often as they used to .
Do you really want to be here ?
I didn &apos;t understand what Tom said in French .
Tom stopped talking .
This movie was very interesting .
We &apos;ll see what Tom has to say .
Who do you think will win ?
I walked the whole way to the station .
Tom isn &apos;t as rich as his friends think he is .
Nobody slept .
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
Tom and Mary were told to stay in their room .
No one &apos;s allowed in here .
I &apos;ve said I &apos;m sorry .
You never know .
Is he all right ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Mary ?
The world is not what it used to be .
How long did you stay in Boston ?
I don &apos;t understand why this isn &apos;t working .
I have been busy today .
Why is everyone scared of Tom ?
Tom was kind enough to help me .
Tom has to listen to us .
Tom called Mary this morning .
You are my friend .
Tom is sitting under that tree over there .
I got up about five .
What did Tom do with the money ?
We must try again .
I like to read books .
I did everything for you .
She passed by without seeing me .
I &apos;ve got one brother and two sisters .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Who &apos;s coming ?
This bicycle is old , but it &apos;s better than nothing .
We like to play soccer .
My hour has not yet come .
Tom wanted some food .
Tom is always happy .
I knew it would make Tom happy .
Tom walked over to where Mary was .
Tom appears to be in pain .
Tom needs our advice .
I can only stay a few minutes .
Tom isn &apos;t certain .
You made Tom very happy .
This is a mistake .
What time can you come ?
What &apos;re you going to do with all that money ?
Who do you think that guy is ?
Tom needed water .
Do you want to drink some beer ?
Tom can &apos;t help you now .
I told you before that you should ask your mother first .
Have you paid the bill yet ?
Tom didn &apos;t try to do anything .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t help you now . I &apos;m busy .
I want to know what &apos;s out there .
Tom met with a traffic accident .
Take a bus .
I would like to meet you .
I can &apos;t be without you .
Your French is good enough .
I don &apos;t want to say anything .
Let &apos;s go to eat together .
How many books do you think you have read so far ?
Why are you going to Boston ?
Don &apos;t be a fool .
We stayed there for three months .
Does Tom have a girlfriend ?
Tom could tell that Mary wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom gave me a ride home .
Now I know why .
He wanted to succeed .
He was home alone at the time .
You may have to pay a little more .
I have a wife and family .
I think I &apos;ll be back in about 30 minutes .
He didn &apos;t say in which year he was born .
Tom believes that .
I go to school here , too .
If you were in my place , what would you do ?
That &apos;s better , isn &apos;t it ?
What is good for you is good for me .
I told them everything .
Tom isn &apos;t up yet .
Are you guys hungry ?
I would rather die than marry him .
These are Tom &apos;s .
Is this your phone ?
What do people usually do in the summer around here ?
I &apos;m not that hungry .
That &apos;s too expensive .
I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
What are you sorry for ?
Do you not know who I am ?
Tom knows that he needs to do something , but he &apos;s not sure what .
He has a house by the sea .
Tom &apos;s children are sick .
You look exactly the same .
We have time enough to eat .
Where did you find the key ?
How do you make money ?
It &apos;s sad .
I have a couple questions .
We only have three days left .
Are you ten years old ?
Who &apos;s having a problem here , you or Tom ?
I don &apos;t believe you .
Tom seems lucky .
Isn &apos;t that what I said ?
The answer to this question is easy .
I tried to save him .
I &apos;ll see you at the hospital .
Why do you always do that to me ?
It is raining all the time .
It &apos;s all going to be fine .
There &apos;s been a lot of rain this summer .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom that he didn &apos;t have to come .
What are you going to get ?
It &apos;s part of life .
I don &apos;t want to cook .
I want to know more about you , Tom .
How many times have I told you ?
You could &apos;ve died .
Have you ever caught a fish ?
We &apos;ve got a problem here .
I saw Tom working on the report this morning .
I never get to see you anymore .
I &apos;m still working on it .
You are not going to make it in time for school .
Tom does what he &apos;s told .
Don &apos;t stop playing .
That &apos;s just the beginning .
Tom is writing a new book .
I can &apos;t think of anyone who hates you more than Tom does .
Who is calling , please ?
Tom won &apos;t win .
We just need a little more money .
He got married three days ago .
We could do that for you .
He got into the car and drove off .
What was the weather like yesterday ?
Will this do ?
We had some questions .
We don &apos;t have that in Europe .
I &apos;ll visit him tomorrow .
Tom is at least a foot taller than Mary .
Don &apos;t do it for me .
The party was such a great success .
Let &apos;s go somewhere quiet so we can talk .
I &apos;ll foot the bill .
Tom gave Mary everything he had , but she still wasn &apos;t satisfied .
I &apos;d like to take this with me .
Tom is fun .
We have nothing against it .
My father is taking a walk in the park .
Please give me a piece of bread .
Maybe we &apos;ll try again later .
Please explain why you can &apos;t come .
It &apos;s very nice of you .
Tom knew Mary .
We &apos;ll get it .
Wait a second .
This bag is too heavy .
Since I was tired , I went to bed .
That can &apos;t be it .
Tom wanted to become a doctor .
Tom is quite shy .
I think you know why I can &apos;t do that .
Tom took Mary to school .
I can &apos;t get her out of my mind .
He knows no English .
I saw him at the station a few days ago .
I want to speak with you .
Tom is convinced that his mother doesn &apos;t want to eat now .
My father and mother were sitting under a tree .
You &apos;re three years older than me .
Tom saw me give Mary some money .
Let &apos;s try something .
I &apos;ve been told that often enough .
I should &apos;ve done that .
He is now almost as tall as his father is .
Tom never should &apos;ve let Mary out of his sight .
That isn &apos;t Tom &apos;s car .
Where are you planning to spend the night ?
I &apos;ll phone you as soon as I get home .
He is away from home .
I have nothing else .
It is likely to rain soon .
Will he come this evening ?
We &apos;ll go out .
Tom is playing golf .
He called me up from Tokyo .
So how did it go with Tom ?
I can do this all night .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
Tom and Mary decided not to leave .
The man died a few hours ago .
The two men sitting on the bench were Americans .
He bought that house because his wife liked it .
I &apos;ll come visit you tomorrow .
Tom was injured .
Tom has just finished eating dinner .
She is good at playing tennis .
I &apos;m not as famous as I used to be .
I wonder what became of Tom .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t see us .
Are you ready to talk about it ?
Tom was dangerous .
I &apos;m here as a friend .
Have a look at that picture .
The car looked as good as new .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do that again .
Tom said that , too .
I &apos;ve got to see it .
I guess Tom was right .
Tom is only five , but he already knows how to read .
I slept a lot .
I &apos;m glad Tom left .
What got into you ?
He can &apos;t stop laughing .
Leave the food on the table .
We &apos;ve already started .
Tom likes talking about himself .
I thought I &apos;d never hear from you again .
Tom is going to go home .
I don &apos;t remember when I first met him .
Is it true that you brought your dog to the office ?
Who says that ?
I want this phone .
Give me a ring tomorrow .
Tom can &apos;t have done it .
I like listening to music .
I was trying to be funny .
The summer here is quite warm .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary .
I asked Tom to come see me .
No one saw us .
You are what you are .
I thought I told you never to go there alone .
You &apos;ll have to learn to cook .
Tom speaks too fast .
My father made me what I am .
Just give it a try .
Why are you so busy all the time ?
I can &apos;t speak English as well as he can .
After lunch , I returned to the office .
Tom made his bed .
Those are the children you gave the book to .
They make a great team .
I &apos;ll show you the city .
I &apos;m glad to see you here .
I don &apos;t want to study today .
Tom is the one who told me about it .
I wonder who she is .
Tom had nothing to eat .
I think I know you .
I believe he is coming tomorrow .
We had a lot of snow last year .
What needs to be done ?
Nobody wants you to do that .
His mother sat up all night waiting for her son .
Aren &apos;t you going to thank me ?
I like that , too .
Do you have any idea who that was ?
I &apos;m taking this one .
Tom looks like his brother .
I wish it didn &apos;t have to be like this .
She left me standing there for two hours .
Tom told me that he was hungry .
Is it far away ?
I want to use this .
I got back in my car .
I finished writing the report .
I &apos;m going to miss that .
She visited him in Boston .
It looks like Tom hasn &apos;t slept much either .
Tom is a good friend of Mary &apos;s .
Tom and I gave Mary that .
You are a woman .
I don &apos;t want to do his work for him .
Tom speaks French very well .
Tom stopped by .
Tom was correct about one thing .
That &apos;s hard to say .
What are you going to make ?
I went outside early in the morning .
I think you like Tom .
This is what I &apos;m good at .
It &apos;s safe here .
She won &apos;t come to class tomorrow .
That &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t know .
You cannot be serious .
Tom hates going to school .
They forgot my birthday .
Tom stood between John and Mary .
I will be back at half past six .
We should go .
We haven &apos;t made a decision yet .
Tom asked me whether I was hungry .
They say he &apos;s sick .
I know the reason , but I can &apos;t tell you .
Tom is short and fat .
Tom is busy making breakfast for the family .
Do you still have family in Boston ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t even know each other .
This is a good question .
Tom died happy .
Tom left Australia in early October .
I sat between Tom and Mary .
I &apos;m not even sure whether Tom will come or not .
She wasn &apos;t able to talk to him .
Is everything OK with Tom ?
I feel stupid .
That name doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
We &apos;ll miss living in Boston .
I want to go out with her .
Can you see the picture ?
We &apos;re like a big family here .
Did it work ?
He &apos;s looking good .
Tom saw him .
It &apos;s been three years since my father died .
I was able to swim faster when I was younger .
The war began three years later .
He did exactly as I had told him .
Don &apos;t listen to her .
Do you want me to ask Tom to do that for you ?
The student was kind enough to show me the way .
I met Tom for the first time three days ago .
I tried for almost an hour .
I plan to go . I don &apos;t care if you do or not .
Get on in here .
That &apos;s where I want to live .
Tom stole money from me .
It works well .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t love each other anymore .
Please mail this letter for me .
I know that this is important .
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know .
I know Tom is over thirty .
I don &apos;t want Tom seeing this .
Tom asked Mary if she was free the next day .
She is used to living alone .
It isn &apos;t there .
Are you guys still together ?
I &apos;m proud to be your father .
This is my brother &apos;s .
I asked Tom to explain .
This is the man who they say stole the car .
I &apos;ll miss that .
I think it &apos;s time for me to ask for her help .
You may use my new car .
I didn &apos;t ask you for your opinion .
She took her seat at the piano and began to play .
You lost the game .
Tom has decided not to move to Boston .
How do you do ?
I like rain and snow .
Why don &apos;t you come earlier ?
I almost always walk to work .
That &apos;s a good picture .
I would never say that .
I got out of my car and closed the door .
I &apos;m a little early .
Call me if you need help .
If Tom had had enough money , he would have gone to Boston with Mary .
The old man lived by himself .
This morning I missed the train I usually take .
I will never tell !
They say he &apos;s very rich .
I have no horse .
Is there a post office around here ?
There &apos;s nothing to do .
You &apos;ll die out there .
He asked me whether I was busy .
Can &apos;t you and Tom stay a little longer ?
Did you really do this all by yourself ?
Tom can &apos;t read yet .
I &apos;ve got as much money as he has .
We can win this war .
You know something , don &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t want to talk to the police .
What time will we arrive in Boston ?
This is your only chance .
Tom &apos;s here .
Tom showed us his mother &apos;s picture .
Please let us know .
Tom is no longer at home .
We &apos;ll have a great time .
I can &apos;t help Tom with that .
I &apos;m not interested in Tom .
She broke my heart .
What can I do to convince you ?
I can &apos;t afford to buy a car .
He is almost six feet tall .
Don &apos;t forget that we have homework .
I can &apos;t leave now .
Tom did that three times .
What will your husband think ?
I &apos;m getting by .
How are your parents doing ?
Tom actually did what he said he &apos;d do .
You seem to know a great deal about Tom .
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .
Tom should hear about this .
Go on and say it .
I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom has a secret .
How are you going to do it ?
Tom didn &apos;t have to tell Mary , but he did .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary should drive home since she &apos;s been drinking .
Tom broke his right leg and was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas .
I &apos;m not certain what to do .
He loves you as much as I do .
What makes you so sad ?
I don &apos;t know a thing about her .
I want to thank you for that .
Tom never thought he &apos;d see Mary again .
What happened to your eye ?
I don &apos;t know where Tom hid the key .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary is dead or alive .
Don &apos;t come in .
I gave Tom no choice .
I should &apos;ve known it was you .
Tom got home just before 2 : 30 .
What &apos;s in this bag ?
His advice didn &apos;t help much .
Tom is good at soccer .
I see a book .
Tom can &apos;t afford anything .
Can you stay with Tom ?
My boss is twice as old as I am .
Tom has never been back to Boston .
Are you free tomorrow ?
Tom is in a bad mood this morning .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
Has everyone gone crazy ?
Do you really think Tom is better than me ?
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
Why were you in Boston last week ?
He had an accident and broke his leg .
This book isn &apos;t mine .
I knew someone like you once .
Nobody could give the correct answer .
Are you home ?
I was stupid enough to believe Tom .
Have you ever been to New York ?
Tom really wants to go to Boston .
Tom is coming to get us .
I knew you &apos;d get here in time .
Where did you meet your girlfriend ?
Tom is busy this afternoon .
I don &apos;t think I can get through all this work by five .
Tom told the police what happened .
Is it worth it ?
It was all Tom &apos;s idea .
Tom wants to live .
Tom was up all night .
Why doesn &apos;t he eat lunch with me anymore ?
Please don &apos;t tell anybody .
This is a dream .
Can the matter wait till tomorrow ?
Where exactly did you see Tom ?
Tom is looking at it .
You know me better than that .
I hope this never happens again .
She doesn &apos;t seem happy .
I don &apos;t know where to start .
Tom is there , isn &apos;t he ?
We know what you &apos;re doing .
Tom was impressed .
I &apos;ll tell you my story .
This one &apos;s no good .
A cup of coffee , please .
How many eggs were you able to get yesterday ?
He did the best he could .
She &apos;ll love her husband forever .
What &apos;s in it for you ?
Tom wants to be happy again .
Your book is on the desk .
You need to get ready .
Tom says he &apos;s too tired to study .
I am not getting involved .
I &apos;ve been very busy since this morning .
You don &apos;t care about me .
The question is simple .
What if you &apos;re wrong ?
I said stop .
I have just come here .
I think Tom isn &apos;t right .
No one knows how many people Tom killed .
Can you tell me how to get to the airport ?
This should be clear to everyone .
What is Tom doing here ? I thought he was in Europe .
I &apos;m not really that sorry .
Tom is old enough to know better .
You can stay here as long as you like .
I don &apos;t find any of this interesting .
Tom won &apos;t go alone .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows why Mary is afraid of him .
You aren &apos;t very good at it , are you ?
I don &apos;t like anything .
She often comes late .
Tom spoke first .
I spent all night working on this report .
Tom wants to stay .
Tom and I &apos;ve gotten back together .
He likes walking in the park .
We have known each other for many years now .
Tom showed Mary around the office .
You certainly have a lot of questions .
Tom has a new woman in his life .
How is your family doing ?
Tom looked fine .
I get the feeling that I &apos;ve heard that somewhere before .
Tom is good at it .
Why isn &apos;t Tom here with us ?
I don &apos;t want to get into the water .
I wonder what has become of his sister .
Tom hasn &apos;t finished all his homework yet .
Thank you for asking me .
He doesn &apos;t run .
Let &apos;s not forget who Tom is .
I need to talk to you .
That &apos;s the way we like it .
I wish today were Monday .
I have no idea how long it &apos;ll take .
Tom and I used to visit each other every weekend .
Tom had nothing to drink .
I don &apos;t have anything else .
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary .
Tom makes more money than Mary .
Tom stayed outside .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s watch .
What do they want you to do ?
The bus is coming .
Tom is as big as I am .
I love my son .
Tom is home again .
This is the house he was born in .
I &apos;ve never done this in my life .
Tom didn &apos;t seem surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married .
&quot; Will he come ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
Let &apos;s just try to have a good time .
Tom is in Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
I have two brothers and three sisters .
He gave his camera to his friend .
Thank you for today .
You know I love you !
Why don &apos;t you just do it ?
It &apos;s not a good idea .
How did Tom know that ?
The taxi has arrived .
No one wants to talk to Tom anymore .
I &apos;ve known that for a long time .
Let me know as soon as anything happens .
Tom said that he would buy it .
Where &apos;s my beer ?
Tom opened the door .
That &apos;s what I love about you , Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to speak to John .
Did you understand what he said ?
This shirt is too small for me to wear .
I know where the money is .
He did the work in two days .
I only need two of these .
I love him , but he loves someone else .
Tom says he has never been to Boston .
It &apos;s your fault .
We don &apos;t have to do that .
Tom got back into his car .
Tom went out .
I think Tom forgot his camera .
Do you want to get married ?
You &apos;re not from around here , are you ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait till tomorrow ?
That ball could &apos;ve hit you .
Who &apos;s the guy over there ?
What time does the train leave for Boston ?
That &apos;s a good school .
We &apos;ll decide later .
It would be a mistake not to do what Tom asked you to do .
Tom knows who they are .
Give it back .
Tom ! What are you doing ?
The ship is at sea .
Don &apos;t you want me there ?
I hope you don &apos;t mind walking .
We &apos;re with you .
Let &apos;s go to my office .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s boss .
It doesn &apos;t look so bad .
You don &apos;t have the right .
Did I hurt his feelings ?
It &apos;s dangerous here .
He promised not to say it .
She can &apos;t cook well .
I can &apos;t sell that to you .
We &apos;re here , too .
This one is full .
She looks confused .
You &apos;ll go far .
How could I help it ?
Tom likes it .
That &apos;s very big of you .
How are you coming ?
I &apos;ll be better tomorrow .
He was stupid enough to believe what she said .
I can &apos;t risk that .
He doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
I &apos;m going to get married again .
Why are girls so cute ?
We have no money .
It looks like it &apos;s going to snow .
Tom is glad he isn &apos;t in your shoes .
It &apos;s your only chance .
Tom believed in me .
Tom and Mary are happy together .
He will be back in ten minutes .
I just want to go home and sleep .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do this .
Your coat is very beautiful .
I &apos;m not listening .
That &apos;s a tree .
Tom sat next to Mary in class .
Tom said Mary wouldn &apos;t be here tomorrow .
Not all of us are against his idea .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about money .
Tom just kept eating .
We &apos;ll go for a drive next Sunday .
He will become a good doctor .
Tom asked Mary out , but she said no .
The desk seems small in this room .
We won &apos;t lose .
Tom knows me well .
We &apos;re not doing that .
We know where Tom is .
I will show it to you only once .
Does it matter to you when we come ?
Do you want this or don &apos;t you ?
Where did you meet my father ?
How do you know Tom is there ?
I don &apos;t listen to music when I &apos;m studying .
She was making tea .
Tom , Mary already has a boyfriend .
I &apos;ll only be staying a few days .
I should be making lunch .
This is the case .
I get it .
I couldn &apos;t answer all the questions .
This isn &apos;t the first time .
He called his mother up from the airport .
Look at my new car .
I don &apos;t care what you do with it .
I don &apos;t feel like going shopping with you today .
We know that and they know that .
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
I don &apos;t have a car anymore .
He &apos;s already a man .
Who are your parents ?
Where are they going to go ?
I am convinced that my son is innocent .
Thanks to you , I arrived on time .
Tom &apos;s sad .
I &apos;m not sure about this .
I &apos;m not that surprised by it .
They are much taller than us .
I asked him to lend me some money .
What makes you think Tom isn &apos;t happy here ?
He is very kind .
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to help .
Please don &apos;t tell anyone about this .
He can &apos;t afford to buy a new car .
Tom hates his job .
Tom &apos;s eaten at that restaurant before .
You &apos;ve done so much already .
My boss isn &apos;t satisfied with my report .
I must be leaving now .
Tom came home drunk from a party .
I &apos;ll make you breakfast .
Tom is looking at you .
It was Tom &apos;s idea , not mine . Don &apos;t blame me .
Don &apos;t get involved with those people .
Don &apos;t you like your job anymore ?
It helped me a lot .
Tom and John were in jail together .
I remember his face but I can &apos;t remember his name .
I think you should give Tom a chance .
We &apos;ll see you when you get home .
He wore a coat too large for him .
Tom likes to eat out .
Could you please tell me how to do that ?
I &apos;m the only one who can do that .
Tom wanted Mary to know that he didn &apos;t hate her .
He no longer lives here .
I already know .
What don &apos;t we know ?
Sunday is the first day of the week .
How did you do it without our help ?
&quot; Where is your father ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have one . &quot;
I go there every day .
We &apos;re not going to give up .
I keep making the same mistake .
I think we &apos;re ready .
I want to buy a new car .
I want to go to America .
Now we know what happened .
Why does Tom think that ?
I haven &apos;t slept for days .
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
The baby doesn &apos;t walk yet .
Did you watch the game ?
He &apos;s in trouble .
I had to open my suitcase .
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about it .
Tom ate dinner about one hour ago .
Tom doesn &apos;t have any children .
He was suddenly very happy .
This has nothing to do with you .
Tom stayed up all night .
Tom sat looking out of the window .
You don &apos;t need to make a decision right now .
We did everything we could .
I &apos;m not sure right now .
I &apos;ll do that .
She ran out of paper .
I have to come on Monday .
Where was it that you found this key ?
You hate them , don &apos;t you ?
Tom said this to me .
Tom didn &apos;t speak to me at all .
I don &apos;t want you to do that .
We can &apos;t turn back now .
Why in the world did you do that ?
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
I think I &apos;m OK .
You should &apos;ve called .
Tom likes cats .
It &apos;s too far to walk .
Tom is too shy to sing in public .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here .
Which university are you studying at ?
We &apos;ve only got thirty minutes .
You look good for your age .
Our baby is learning to speak .
Tom started crying immediately .
I think you haven &apos;t understood the question .
Did he stay very long ?
I just saw you guys three days ago .
Stop doing that .
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything .
All boys like to play baseball .
I &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow .
I wonder why Tom is afraid .
How can we meet new people ?
I like how Tom thinks .
Tom is coming back .
He is ill .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m in Australia .
I &apos;m not getting any younger .
Has something happened ?
Tom wanted to get married .
I have no time to read books .
Tom is absent .
She left the room .
You &apos;re probably the only person who can help me do that .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning .
I want some money .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom is my student .
They are all college students .
Why can &apos;t you all just leave me alone ?
Get back to the ship .
You &apos;ll understand it later on .
Tom allowed his dog to run free .
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had come ?
He fell in love with her at first sight .
Tom is living with his parents .
Give me a telephone call when you get back .
This boy is his brother .
I &apos;ll be back at half past six .
Tom made Mary do it .
That isn &apos;t it .
You do ask a lot of questions .
I don &apos;t know anyone like that .
They look good .
Tom and I got married .
You don &apos;t need to thank us .
Tom said he was ready to leave .
Tom arrived half an hour early .
I want to know why you &apos;re here .
He is old .
I almost kissed him .
Are they brothers ?
Here &apos;s what I want to do .
Why don &apos;t we take a break ?
I wonder why Tom hit Mary .
I wouldn &apos;t have done that if I were you .
I know that voice .
It &apos;s what Tom would want .
Who is your lawyer ?
It won &apos;t cost us anything .
I &apos;m taller than Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to buy what he wanted to buy .
Tom had a knife .
He might come tomorrow .
I &apos;ll be your teacher .
I saw them yesterday .
Did you give the children enough to eat ?
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary had come to Boston .
There was a church here once .
You need to help me find Tom .
Where do you want to go this summer ?
I study hard at school .
&quot; Can I help you ? &quot; &quot; No , thank you . I &apos;m just looking around . &quot;
Tom , do you want to go with me ?
Tom took Mary to the park .
Tom has gone to get Mary .
I love pizza very much .
I like to study languages .
The man raised his hand to ask a question .
Tom went alone .
Don &apos;t be late for school tomorrow .
The next morning , Tom was dead .
Turn on the radio .
I was in the hospital for a few days .
Those don &apos;t belong to Tom .
This book is heavy .
Tom and Mary have gone .
I want to see it again .
I have the dictionary .
That &apos;s what I want from you .
Be very careful .
He didn &apos;t keep his promise that he would telephone me soon .
I thought you were mad at Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is doing .
What did you eat for breakfast ?
I seldom listen to the radio .
I think you &apos;d like it .
I should call a doctor .
I think that I &apos;m doing something wrong .
When would you like to begin ?
I am going to swim a lot this summer .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t angry .
Everything Tom said was true .
Tom is a student , too .
We almost didn &apos;t make it to the church on time .
I have to go to Boston with Tom .
They won &apos;t find Tom there .
How lucky I am !
You &apos;d better stay in bed for a few days .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money to buy a house .
I have three dogs .
I want to ask you a big favor .
He can speak five languages .
Tell Tom you want to go to Boston .
Tom got out of the taxi .
Isn &apos;t that sweet ?
Tom said that he needed to go to bed .
You should have told it to me sooner .
He is still sitting on the bench .
It would be best if I did that by myself .
Tom is probably just shy .
Where on earth did you meet him ?
Give Tom whatever it is he wants .
It would be smart not to do that .
Why are they doing this ?
Please tell me what &apos;s wrong , Tom .
Here is your dog .
I wanted to meet you .
That wasn &apos;t your fault .
Was Tom happy doing that ?
Tom started crying .
I know what Tom wants .
I just found it .
What do you want to be ?
I understand Tom .
Be careful not to hurt Tom &apos;s feelings .
May I go out for a walk ?
The problem is too difficult to solve .
Tom isn &apos;t allowed to go there .
I hope that I can do it .
His life is full of trouble .
I &apos;ve finished all the work for today .
I &apos;d like a chance to explain why I made this choice .
This telephone is out of order .
You broke your leg .
Don &apos;t let me die here .
Do you have anything against Tom ?
No one loves war .
So why don &apos;t you tell Tom that ?
How many cats do you have ?
I may die tomorrow .
Are you up ?
I hope they throw Tom in jail .
We do almost everything together .
They &apos;re proud of me .
Tom was in the kitchen helping his mother .
It was very cold , but I went out .
Tom isn &apos;t healthy .
He gave her a book .
Why is Tom not helping Mary ?
What &apos;s in it for me ?
Tom pulled something out of his pocket and put it on his desk .
I &apos;ll give you another chance if you want it .
Tom asked Mary a few questions that she couldn &apos;t answer , but she was able to answer most of his questions .
You can &apos;t do that anymore .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
I agree with him .
He &apos;s younger than me .
That &apos;s my car .
I have something to say .
I cannot help you .
The dog seems to have been sick .
I know what I think .
I think I could help .
Tom is angry with you .
He promised me he would be here at six .
I &apos;ve had no problems with my boss .
The family is watching a movie together .
Is this mine ?
Tom &apos;s French is very good .
I &apos;d like to call my family .
You don &apos;t look sick .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s in that box .
I &apos;d like to be alone if you don &apos;t mind .
Tom is tall and strong .
I thought he wouldn &apos;t come .
Tom told us some jokes .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
Tom said that he was very hungry .
You &apos;re a good student .
Mary hasn &apos;t received the flowers yet .
Did Tom go to college ?
Is he back already ?
Will you please tell us where Tom is ?
Tom came from a good home .
It &apos;s Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s hot in this room .
We don &apos;t know how or why .
Tom has no idea what to do .
Tom is coming to my house tonight .
I can &apos;t drink milk .
Where were you born ?
What language is it written in ?
I thought the game was over .
Tom was waiting .
Are you sure that &apos;s what it was ?
Tom has big eyes .
Tom probably didn &apos;t know about the meeting .
Tom has stopped crying .
It &apos;s night .
We don &apos;t have snow here .
My cat is happy .
Don &apos;t talk to me like I &apos;m a child .
Tom wanted to know everything about me .
Are you the new teacher ?
Did you play tennis ?
How far are you going ?
Do you want me to help you with your homework ?
You have to get out of here .
You &apos;ll have to come with us .
You &apos;d better not speak .
We &apos;d better get ready early because the train won &apos;t wait .
Tom found himself a seat near the door .
Are you going to sing ?
That &apos;s not bad .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
The woman who is sitting on the sofa is my grandmother .
Please write it down .
He &apos;s completely crazy .
She looks happy .
Tom wondered why Mary didn &apos;t like John .
I often make mistakes when speaking in French .
We had nice weather yesterday .
That &apos;ll be hard to explain .
Tom sat next to me .
My father is in his room .
He has hardly any money , but he gets by .
I don &apos;t believe he is a lawyer .
Tom could &apos;ve said something .
She was busy doing her homework .
It is dangerous to swim here .
Mary received beautiful flowers from her son .
Just keep your hands where I can see them .
Tom likes it when I do that .
No one likes war .
I don &apos;t know if he knows it .
Would you like to see it now ?
I thought you were happy .
I don &apos;t know what Tom did with it .
Tom lives from hand to mouth .
I don &apos;t know her at all .
This is too small .
No one knows his name .
The work was all but finished .
I want to stay here .
What kind of music do you like ?
The news can &apos;t be true .
Tom is living in Boston .
It &apos;ll be good to get home .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d like that .
Aren &apos;t you OK with this ?
Tom pretended not to understand French .
I eat rice every day .
Tom told Mary that he wanted to eat .
I don &apos;t like it when people keep me waiting .
Tom is here again .
How did you learn to cook so well ?
I think that this is important .
You &apos;re way faster than me .
I don &apos;t want any more coffee .
Don &apos;t you love me anymore ?
He is said to have been strong .
Come on ! We &apos;re going to be late .
If I don &apos;t do it now , I never will .
Tom is almost as tall as me .
There &apos;s so much more to learn .
Tom left .
There &apos;s only one explanation .
I can &apos;t love anyone but you .
He asked her some questions .
Is Tom here ?
You might want to sit down . This is going to take a while .
There &apos;s something on the table .
Is that not enough ?
Tom says he &apos;s fine .
I can &apos;t believe Tom and Mary have been together for ten years .
I really don &apos;t need any help .
Who brought Tom ?
Who &apos;s there ?
Tom is a person you can trust .
Tom knows we trust Mary .
Tom has got three of them .
Take it to Tom .
It is you who is to blame .
I &apos;m Japanese , but I don &apos;t live in Japan .
He &apos;s not ready .
Do as I say , not as I do .
Tom didn &apos;t say who he &apos;d gone with .
I was helping Tom .
Do you guys want to eat here ?
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
I can &apos;t get this open .
I spoke to Tom yesterday .
I believed that he would keep his promise .
I don &apos;t like living in the country .
Is Mary your daughter ?
I can hardly understand you .
I speak French and English .
They &apos;re gone .
I wonder whether Tom is nervous or not .
I was tired today .
This is where Tom and Mary live .
That boy &apos;s name is Tom .
Were you really that worried about me ?
Why don &apos;t you want to tell us the truth ?
They were worried .
We &apos;re reading .
You can &apos;t do everything .
I feel bad today .
It &apos;s really simple .
Tom won &apos;t die .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary went .
We &apos;ll stand .
I &apos;m looking for your sister . Where is she ?
Where are your people ?
I &apos;m no longer angry at you .
They probably don &apos;t know .
Do you think Tom is OK ?
I hate it when you &apos;re right .
I &apos;m not being paid enough .
Those are my things .
It &apos;s up to us .
I &apos;d like to know what it is .
I think it &apos;s going to be a nice day .
The food was so good that I ate too much .
Tom is a hard person to please .
You are not our friend .
Her plan seems to be better than mine .
I &apos;d like some more water .
Tom won &apos;t like it in Australia .
I &apos;m a man .
I like my house .
The dictionary on the desk is Tom &apos;s .
I like this . I &apos;ll take it .
I &apos;m sure Tom won &apos;t help us .
I have to feed my cat .
That sounds a little dangerous .
It &apos;s very cold now .
He often drives to the library .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to swim .
We should make Tom leave .
Tom is late .
What &apos;s it like being Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
I &apos;ll be very careful .
We know everything .
We can do much better .
Tom liked Mary as soon as he met her .
Tom had almost forgotten all about what had happened .
It was a bad idea .
These are my friends .
Where &apos;s my brother ?
He got off the train .
I hope Tom didn &apos;t take it too hard .
I know Tom likes Mary .
He didn &apos;t know that .
She cannot have understood what you said .
It &apos;s all our fault .
There &apos;s no doubt that he &apos;s innocent .
I told Tom what Mary told me .
We &apos;ve arrived .
They gave it to me .
I don &apos;t know as many people as you do .
Tom will never see you again .
Tom rarely wears a hat .
Was it fun to do that ?
It &apos;s just a game .
Tom loves reading .
They get along like a cat and a dog .
I &apos;ll ask him .
She &apos;s not a good person .
You made the mistake on purpose , didn &apos;t you ?
That is quite another matter .
Who &apos;s next ?
Tom wants to come with us .
He has no right to do this .
Tom still doesn &apos;t speak much French .
Tom and Mary had three children .
It was my plan .
I &apos;m free on Monday .
Tom told me that he was sick .
I will write you back soon .
Tom returned from Australia yesterday .
Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
My sister started crying .
Tom and Mary have a second home .
My sister doesn &apos;t have a car .
I have to do this alone .
I &apos;ve been working with Tom for three months .
Is it all paid for ?
I don &apos;t know what they think .
I waited for Tom for a long time .
This is too big .
My uncle comes to see me from time to time .
We are men .
I have the same dictionary as your brother has .
If you eat too much , you &apos;ll become fat .
This is a better house than the other one .
I don &apos;t really want to do that .
He didn &apos;t know what to say .
Tom might wait .
Tom knows how to do this .
Didn &apos;t anybody tell you that you didn &apos;t have to be here today ?
It &apos;s very cold .
Tom picked Mary up .
What do I have ?
I hope we &apos;re not too late .
Tell me the reason you didn &apos;t come yesterday .
We don &apos;t have it .
I really want to see Tom .
I could hardly understand him .
I would like a word with you .
Tom is going to be a father .
Tom has just started learning French .
Tom and Mary used to be pretty good friends .
He has come !
Whose friend are you ?
Tom said he &apos;d be there .
Do you want to do it with me ?
I don &apos;t believe you can do it .
Why do I have to give this to you ?
I can &apos;t make out what she wants .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doing here .
She made me a cake .
It &apos;s hard to explain .
I didn &apos;t let them know .
You won &apos;t believe what I just saw .
I must study .
I &apos;ll never forget that feeling .
If I had had to do it , I would have done it at that time .
Aren &apos;t you guys done yet ?
Who is the boss here ?
How tall are you ?
Tom saw Mary in the park .
I don &apos;t remember anymore .
I have lost my key .
I already said I &apos;m not going .
I can ride a bike .
I don &apos;t think Tom meant it .
He is poor .
How often should you wash your hair ?
I will never have a son .
Tom and Mary started walking .
Tom said he &apos;d had nothing to do with what had happened .
I got it .
How are you all ?
Tom stayed in Boston a few days .
I can &apos;t go to lunch with you today .
I &apos;m not your mother .
She put on a coat .
I didn &apos;t believe Tom .
I want to ask you something .
You said you &apos;d be here by 2 : 30 .
Is this love ?
There was much work to do .
You may know Tom .
Tom asked for some water .
Do you want milk in your coffee ?
Your kids are cute .
Maybe Tom is sick .
What do you think is going on ?
Tom can &apos;t move .
We couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
Do you think Tom will ever do that again ?
Thank you for being there .
I often visited his house .
Do it tomorrow .
I got a bicycle for Christmas .
He was young .
I don &apos;t see him .
He works in a bank .
Why not look into the matter yourself ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary well enough to ask her to do that .
Tom pretended that he didn &apos;t care that he was poor .
I &apos;m not crazy .
I understood very well .
Tom just can &apos;t make up his mind .
I would read this book , but I don &apos;t have the time .
You &apos;re not going , are you ?
I can &apos;t wait till summer .
We don &apos;t get on well with each other .
I think it &apos;s time you and Tom went home .
Everybody hates them .
Do what Tom says .
I was glad to hear of your success .
So , how long have you known Tom ?
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said to Mary ?
Is someone here ?
I haven &apos;t worked for years .
I &apos;m looking for a house .
How &apos;s the family ?
There is no one in the house .
I was married here .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
Tom drives slowly .
They have lived in this town for ten years .
I &apos;m going to name him Tom .
It has stopped raining .
My father is rich .
I can &apos;t show you this .
I &apos;m glad Tom isn &apos;t here .
I think Tom likes Mary .
Tom was sitting alone in his room .
I &apos;ll do whatever I can to help you .
Would you like another piece of cake ?
I didn &apos;t mean it that way .
We are watching TV .
Tom plays baseball every day .
Tom has done it before .
Would you like to play a game ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for him for an hour .
I left the room .
Tom is in the park .
He &apos;s good .
I need to buy one .
I have the same number of books as he has .
I didn &apos;t meet anyone .
Tom isn &apos;t up here .
I will not let you do it .
It &apos;s about time for you to leave .
They made me go there .
I want to be there .
Tom didn &apos;t say when he &apos;d be here .
Tom stood very close to Mary .
He put on his coat and left the house .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me about you .
We &apos;ll go with you .
I need the money .
Tom won &apos;t mind .
You &apos;re going to be proud of me .
Is this about me ?
I &apos;m old enough to decide for myself .
There &apos;s someone at the door who wants to talk to you .
I &apos;ll study hard tomorrow .
Can you play tennis ?
I know what we need to do .
They came back .
Tom can &apos;t get enough of it .
Tom said he isn &apos;t going to Mary &apos;s party .
Tom said he could give Mary some money .
Tom isn &apos;t himself .
Everyone knows the law .
Tom is only three months older than Mary .
Tom won &apos;t get back home today .
They are running in the park .
I just can &apos;t help .
What are they doing out here ?
Tom was almost as surprised as Mary .
Why isn &apos;t Tom in the car ?
You do look a little better today .
Is Tom doing OK ?
Tom says he &apos;s tired .
Tom said that Mary was very drunk .
Did Tom talk to you about that ?
I want to see what you have inside your house .
I see that it is raining .
You can &apos;t do that .
You aren &apos;t very happy , are you ?
How long do you plan on staying in this country ?
Tom thinks he knows where Mary went .
I had a chance to travel abroad .
You make good money , don &apos;t you ?
I came to this country for the purpose of studying music .
I believe Tom will win .
That &apos;s not my problem .
She doesn &apos;t know how to drive a car .
Tom doesn &apos;t like talking about his feelings .
I pretended to believe what Tom told me .
Where am I now ?
I was away for a year .
Tom hasn &apos;t changed at all .
I went to the room .
I &apos;d love to be your age .
Maybe we should wait until Tom gets here .
He didn &apos;t study at all .
I &apos;m really going to miss this house .
Come home before six .
I have a boyfriend who loves me .
After Tom passed away , Mary went back to her parents &apos; home .
Is he still interested ?
I know you know this .
I wish I could live my life doing only what I wanted to do .
What are you going to do ?
This could happen to anybody .
Are you in love ?
Tom and I swim together three times a week .
No one has ever done this before .
This problem seems difficult .
I &apos;ll give it to Tom .
The idea isn &apos;t bad .
You &apos;re back again .
This is Tom &apos;s .
We &apos;ll do it the same way we did it last time .
It was very cold .
We know where you live .
I hit on a good idea .
Tom just listened .
You &apos;re good at that .
It is too expensive .
I don &apos;t think Tom has met Mary yet .
He is a doctor .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that again .
Tom says he can &apos;t eat any more .
I have one .
What I &apos;m saying is true .
She died yesterday afternoon .
Tom didn &apos;t make the team .
I can stay in the car while you go into the bank .
He was listening to music in his room .
Why are you angry with Tom ?
You should &apos;ve seen us dancing together .
He won &apos;t listen to me .
I don &apos;t agree .
Don &apos;t you want to go out ?
&quot; Is your father busy ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t think he is . &quot;
Thanks for having me here .
It was a new experience for me .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s friend .
The baby is looking for its mother .
I can &apos;t open this bottle .
The plane arrived on time .
You can do it , Tom . I know you can .
Why didn &apos;t you call us ?
Her idea is better than yours .
Let &apos;s talk about why you &apos;re here .
Don &apos;t play with me .
Is there anything wrong with you ?
Tom told Mary that he loved Alice .
I &apos;ve been in New York once .
It &apos;s two o &apos;clock in the morning .
Tom and Mary still love each other .
Tom doesn &apos;t often get a chance to do that .
Everyone knows everyone .
Can you really swim ?
Tom , could I have a word with you ?
They &apos;ll do it .
Tom told me he speaks French .
We &apos;re still not allowed to visit Tom .
Tom has been married twice .
Tom worked in the garden for a long time .
It wasn &apos;t supposed to be this way .
That &apos;s not what you said last night .
Tom wears a hat almost every day .
I want this one .
How long have you been here in Boston ?
I only have a week to get this done .
I don &apos;t understand what she wants me to do .
You made it happen .
Tom can &apos;t do this as well as I can .
Tom lives with his mother .
I don &apos;t like anything Tom does .
Do your parents know about this ?
Tom didn &apos;t make it very far .
You &apos;re better than I am .
How did you come by such a job ?
Tom told me he wanted to quit his job .
That wasn &apos;t our fault .
How can I get to the airport ?
She got into the car and drove off .
I just did what the boss asked me to do .
Could you please have a look at this ?
I asked Tom if he wanted to go swimming .
I thought Tom was a doctor .
Tom is sick in bed .
Tom didn &apos;t even ask me about it .
Can I go buy some ice cream ?
I &apos;m in love with her .
I can &apos;t stand the noise .
I think Tom didn &apos;t understand you .
I &apos;m not as tall as he is .
How did that happen ?
We often hear French being spoken here .
I don &apos;t need a car .
All of them went there .
We needed to do that .
Don &apos;t give me that !
He had no money .
That car over there is mine .
May I run with you ?
They &apos;re not going to stop Tom .
We have to look after our parents .
Tom can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I don &apos;t live with my family .
Mary was like a sister to me .
It &apos;s too soon .
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
She wasn &apos;t able to contact him by phone .
Tom managed to find a new job .
Have you read Tom &apos;s new book ?
They &apos;re taking too long .
I only hope that that &apos;s enough .
They &apos;ll find her .
What are we doing ?
I &apos;m so tired !
Tom is still confused .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s girl .
Tom drank too much .
She is her friend .
That is a very good thing .
Did you do this on your own ?
I wanted more .
Tom doesn &apos;t know Mary is in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t feel well .
Tom can &apos;t play the guitar .
Don &apos;t forget your money .
You won &apos;t need an umbrella today .
Tom thinks Mary should apologize to John for not doing what she said she &apos;d do .
Tom is a university student .
I &apos;m safe .
He has been working on a new book for two months .
No one can understand your letter .
Have you finished studying ?
Tom has a wife and three children .
I have to write a letter . Do you have some paper ?
Does Tom have to write the letter today ?
Tom went into the bank .
Is your mother here ?
I never would &apos;ve thought that I &apos;d meet you here .
I &apos;ll come and get you .
I don &apos;t know what to tell you .
We do this every year .
Let &apos;s take a train .
Please tell Tom that I called .
My cat and dog get along .
Do you want to hear the truth ?
He can drive a car .
What have you been doing all this while ?
How long do I have to wait for the next bus ?
I knew that was Tom .
Tom never asked .
I see a house .
Tom isn &apos;t really Canadian .
Let me see that list .
He is happy .
Your time &apos;s up .
I really like that guy .
I thought you said Tom would be asleep .
Tom also saw it .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen .
I &apos;ll stand by you no matter what happens .
Tom did that really well .
I know where Tom is .
I cannot afford to buy a new bicycle .
Don &apos;t you want to go with me ?
Don &apos;t say anything to anybody .
Be quiet and listen .
Tom is going to Boston next week for a meeting .
You &apos;ll love Tom .
I helped .
Tom is coming with us to Boston .
My arm hurts .
I just finished reading the book .
Take anything you like .
How far is it from here to the station ?
Tom is here already .
This coffee is too strong for me .
This is his house .
I &apos;ll leave you two alone .
Tom never told me he wanted to go to Boston with us .
Here &apos;s the key .
We speak French .
Tom knows exactly what he wants .
Tom is likely to come .
Tom was in Boston last weekend .
She always speaks ill of others .
We &apos;re leaving .
What is it you &apos;d like me to do exactly ?
I almost never get what I ask for .
Tom and I were both at the meeting .
I don &apos;t understand at all .
Would you like to have another beer ?
I saw Tom in the park .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
I would like some hot tea , please .
I won &apos;t let you go there .
Tom has been quite busy recently .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was so lonely .
It was just stupid .
We really have to go back to Boston .
Have you written a book ?
Tom &apos;s sleeping .
The food &apos;s ready .
Tom and I work together .
I will be gone by the time she comes back .
Is that too much to ask ?
I &apos;ve never seen you cook . Can you cook anything at all ?
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
He has more books than I do .
Tom wondered where Mary had spent the weekend .
You know her name , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not sure who Tom is married to .
What &apos;s Tom going to say about that ?
Tom has been here for years .
It &apos;s not new .
She is a very good teacher .
Is Boston very far away ?
Is there anything you need to do today ?
My father is at home .
He saw it , too .
I &apos;d like to speak to Tom .
Everybody left .
Do you like your new job ?
We came out ahead .
I &apos;m glad it makes you happy .
Tom looked at his watch .
I &apos;ll give you a call when I get home .
Have a good look at this picture .
I &apos;ve never told anyone about this .
I have known that for a long time .
It &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had such nice weather .
Tom has already gone to sleep .
Tom knows what &apos;s up .
Does Tom enjoy it ?
When will you finish your work ?
How much is this radio ?
I think there has been some kind of mistake .
Why &apos;d you do that ?
You can &apos;t still be mad at me .
I want to know how Tom thinks .
Who came ?
I didn &apos;t want anything to do with Tom .
How long you can stand on one leg ?
Tom wasn &apos;t sure what to do .
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think he did .
I never asked for this .
I decided not to go to Europe .
Mary is very cute .
They say she &apos;s good at cooking .
Are you sure that you have enough money ?
Tom wants to go back to Boston .
I didn &apos;t expect that to come from you .
It was an accident .
He must find work .
Is it difficult to learn French ?
I saw that coming .
Tom might be able to do that .
We don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m looking for a job .
I often go swimming at the beach in the summer .
Why are these people here ?
You never call me .
She can &apos;t find her hat .
Tom came into the building .
Are we done ?
I &apos;m happy for Tom and Mary .
Tom knew nothing about it .
I knew too much .
Let &apos;s walk on the beach after dinner .
This isn &apos;t the first time Tom has lied .
I caught three fish yesterday .
Tom didn &apos;t say whether he would go to Mary &apos;s party or not .
I already know how to drive .
Tom knows why Mary is in a bad mood .
We &apos;ll let you know .
I &apos;m sorry , my father &apos;s not here .
Tom was willing to try it again .
That &apos;s not good enough .
How old do you think she is ?
I tried to help him .
You can talk here .
Tom isn &apos;t doing so well .
I don &apos;t know where to begin .
Tell Tom .
That has something to do with this problem .
That &apos;s a beautiful name .
People are looking at you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as Mary .
I should like to go for a swim .
Tom and Mary sometimes play tennis together .
Why did Tom want you here ?
You &apos;re better able to do it than I am .
Tom is glad .
I don &apos;t understand that .
How could that have happened ?
I can &apos;t do it either .
Tom told Mary not to go there alone .
Let go of the bottle .
I don &apos;t want to know his name .
Tom knows you &apos;re the one that started this .
Bring me my glasses .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you were coming ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go there .
Can you really not swim ?
Are you sure you can do this ?
You &apos;ll be safe with him .
I want to know your opinion .
Tom seemed to be expecting something .
Did Tom see this ?
Tom is going to love this .
Tom didn &apos;t get paid .
I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
Tom and Mary want to go home .
Do you think I don &apos;t know that ?
I thought you &apos;d wear something like that .
Nobody is really sure .
Do you think Tom told us the truth ?
I wish you had told me the truth then .
The box is empty .
I finally was able to contact Tom .
He &apos;s never satisfied .
I know French .
I need some coffee .
There are no women here .
I don &apos;t mind sleeping on the couch .
You &apos;ve known Tom much longer than I have .
I hope you &apos;ll be able to see Tom soon .
Who &apos;s your mom ?
There is a little money in the bag .
Don &apos;t you want me here ?
Tom was driving .
Tom needs some sleep .
Tom knows that he has a choice to make .
He seems disappointed in his son .
You can sit with me .
It &apos;s about time to go to school .
I &apos;m going to New York next week .
I &apos;m really lonely .
She is far from beautiful .
Tom is now almost as tall as his father .
I want you to make me a promise .
Tom won &apos;t be here that long .
Don &apos;t you like me ?
Tom bought his daughter a dress .
That &apos;s quite possible .
Is it far ?
What &apos;re we going to do ?
I &apos;ve met you before .
Have we understood each other ?
Can it wait until tomorrow ?
I was never very nice to you , was I ?
What &apos;s missing ?
We all know .
How do you live like this ?
My computer won &apos;t start up anymore .
I want to speak to my lawyer .
I know how happy you are .
Why were you late ?
You can &apos;t have both .
Don &apos;t smoke in here .
I thought you were Canadian .
Since I had a cold , I didn &apos;t go to school .
Tom &apos;s daughter is sick .
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
You can make it .
She took the trouble to find a home for them .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who Mary is .
Tom &apos;s smart .
I &apos;m a good boy .
He turned out to be her father .
I &apos;m upset .
How many times did you talk to Tom last week ?
I &apos;m far from happy about this situation .
Tom fell out of love with Mary .
I don &apos;t know what kind of car Tom has .
I understand it more or less .
Tom got injured .
Tom will do that tomorrow , too .
I didn &apos;t expect you to be here .
We all want Tom to be happy .
I listened .
Tom will be back from Australia next Monday .
What must I do to convince you ?
Do you want to do this ?
Tom could go to jail for this .
I had to make a choice .
I &apos;m going to need help .
I think I &apos;ve been here before .
Tom asked me to do it .
I have it at home .
We are all happy to help .
It &apos;s time to put the children to bed .
I &apos;d really rather not eat that .
It &apos;s not my cup of tea .
Please have someone else do that .
We &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
Tom changed .
You may be correct .
Tom loves going out with his friends .
They love that song .
Tom told Mary to stay at home .
Children are our future .
How many times a week do you study French ?
Why do you want to talk to me ?
Tom left early .
We &apos;ve already eaten .
How is your wife doing ?
It might be Tom .
I will finish my homework by nine .
I &apos;d like to ask you the same question once more .
What &apos;s Tom doing here ?
Who are you to tell me what I need ?
I want my money returned immediately .
You &apos;re with me , aren &apos;t you ?
You have no one but yourself to blame .
Tom left the house after eating lunch .
I don &apos;t mind if you smoke .
That doesn &apos;t answer my question .
Tom must &apos;ve known this would happen .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be disappointed .
Tom didn &apos;t see a thing .
Let us out .
Did Tom say he left early ?
I was one of the best students in the class .
I have Tom &apos;s address somewhere .
How long does it take to the train station by taxi ?
What a beautiful girl she is .
I hope I can be of some help to you .
I do not feel guilty .
Tom has decided to go to college .
Do you think I &apos;m to blame ?
He will do his best to finish it on time .
Do you know where she was born ?
I think you know Tom .
Perhaps he &apos;ll never become famous .
I forgot his name .
Look at that one there .
I didn &apos;t win .
That is not your knife .
Tom looked up at me .
How many days are there in a week ?
You know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;d like to live in Europe .
I was in Tokyo yesterday .
She &apos;s sure to succeed .
Tom ate one apple .
My mother left home ten minutes ago .
Did that surprise you ?
Tom raised his arm .
I see no reason not to .
I have many friends .
This is kind of fun .
Nothing will happen until 2 : 30 .
Tom will come at 2 : 30 .
If I were you , I &apos;d ask him .
Tom needs a coat .
He plays the piano better than me .
I think you hate Tom as much as he hates you .
I shouldn &apos;t have brought it up .
Tom wrote a letter to himself .
I like the rain and the snow .
Tom isn &apos;t able to drive yet .
I don &apos;t want to lose you , Tom .
The floor was cold .
Tom wondered where Mary went to school .
Tom is the one that doesn &apos;t like me .
Do what the doctor said .
I am a university student .
I knew you &apos;d find me .
He has nothing against it .
I don &apos;t think I could spend six hours alone with you .
What little money I had was stolen .
What &apos;ll you do after school today ?
Tom has already started eating lunch .
I &apos;m in danger .
What did Tom give Mary ?
We will discuss this problem later .
Tom is as old as my father .
Tom is far better today than he was yesterday .
Tom said he &apos;s not doing it .
Make Tom pay for what he did .
I think it &apos;s around here .
I can &apos;t explain what happened .
I think those are Tom &apos;s books .
I hate the way that he speaks to me .
She gave him her name and telephone number .
I agree .
They already knew .
It is about time you went to school .
Give me what I want .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to ask Tom to help ?
What does Tom want you to do ?
Who knows what you saw ?
Tom managed to get some sleep on the plane .
I &apos;ll go get it for you .
He doesn &apos;t sleep .
I can &apos;t swim now as well as I used to be able to .
He killed himself .
Is it something serious ?
I only know that Tom isn &apos;t happy .
I want Tom &apos;s money .
I am not a student .
I &apos;m impressed with your French .
Aren &apos;t you going to eat anything ?
This tea is very good .
I have the same dictionary as your brother .
It &apos;s time for me to go .
Tom is no longer living here .
Where is your father ?
We have to get back before Tom does .
Tom said he was having problems with Mary .
Tom fell asleep under the tree .
I &apos;ll give you my opinion .
Are they here ?
That &apos;s not good .
We both know you don &apos;t live where you say you do .
Tom thought Mary was probably about thirty .
What kind of movie is it ? Is it popular ?
Tom has three kids .
It was all my fault .
Tom is the guy I told you about .
I &apos;m so proud of you .
It is expensive to live in Japan .
I thought it would be a good concert , but it wasn &apos;t .
I can swim across the river .
It has to be done .
I &apos;ve promised Tom that I &apos;d be there .
I &apos;ve never won anything before .
Tom can ride a bicycle .
I know you don &apos;t remember me .
I went to bed a little earlier than usual .
Children need to play .
You have a good camera .
I &apos;ll buy this .
I know when Tom &apos;s birthday is .
I was going to wash my hair .
I can &apos;t believe Tom really said no to me .
Tom left , leaving Mary alone with John .
We were all so scared .
Are you going to buy that ?
Tom should &apos;ve stayed home .
I refused at first .
Did you see what Tom did to Mary ?
He told me to meet him at his house .
I can &apos;t quit thinking about you .
What have we done ?
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to play with his kids .
Tom is talking to himself .
She asked a very good question .
Tom is a bit younger than me .
They can &apos;t give me what I want .
What I drink the most is coffee .
We have to stop Tom before he hurts anybody else .
They are looking to you for help .
Tom isn &apos;t much taller than his father .
Tom saw us .
Who is that boy ?
Tom hasn &apos;t done his homework yet .
She brought a cup of tea to me .
I just want what I was promised .
You &apos;re not ready for this .
Do your children know French ?
Tom bought a car .
Tom used the key Mary had given him to open the door .
This book is sold here .
Tom never goes anywhere by himself .
Where has the time gone ?
Don &apos;t leave the window open .
What do you want ?
When will we meet ?
I &apos;m coming for you , Tom .
What else do you have ?
You &apos;d better not go there .
Whose car is that ?
Please tell Tom Mary called .
They were angry about several things .
Thank you .
That &apos;s not a real word .
The dog began to run .
We &apos;ll see you .
I started studying French three years ago .
I &apos;m a friend .
If only I could drive a car .
Tom stayed and helped Mary .
That would be a good start .
The choice is yours , Tom .
Have another drink on me .
Tom asked Mary about her new job .
Everything must come to an end .
This road will take you to the station .
Don &apos;t give it to Tom .
Tom wants to go to Australia .
I think it &apos;s a good thing .
I &apos;ve already been working here for several hours .
It &apos;s your book .
That &apos;s what I want , too .
Tom likes to run .
This isn &apos;t fun .
You should eat more vegetables .
I would do it if I could .
He lives far away from my house .
I have food .
You &apos;re my age .
He lives on this street .
I &apos;m happy for you .
It &apos;s time for us to go .
Tom doesn &apos;t care about anybody but himself .
This was my plan all along .
Tom speaks very slowly .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to wait for Tom ?
How can I change your mind ?
I really want to go .
Tom said he didn &apos;t kiss Mary .
You &apos;re not going to like that , are you ?
Does Tom have a problem with that ?
There was only a little milk left in the bottle .
They found Tom .
Tom took one last look around the room before he left .
Tom &apos;s and Mary &apos;s parents are friends .
Tom knows what Mary wants to do .
I need some milk .
Tom needs work .
Tom is badly hurt .
Tom is thirty .
I &apos;ve always been here .
I don &apos;t know much about your family .
I don &apos;t think that you did all this homework by yourself .
I &apos;ll get back to you on this .
We &apos;re from Boston .
I want you to do this work .
Tom didn &apos;t drive Mary home .
His sister is not going to America .
It &apos;s a good thing .
I am quite satisfied .
Tom read thirty books last year .
&quot; Did you complete the report I asked you to write ? &quot; &quot; No . There was no time . &quot;
You have time .
You should call your mother as soon as possible .
Get in here !
I enjoy studying French .
Where is the train station ?
Tom can &apos;t swim yet .
I &apos;ll never forget how kind Tom was to everyone .
How long have you worked in Boston ?
Tom saw Mary at the station .
Tom passed away last night .
Was that another joke ?
I think they like us .
It &apos;s time for a break .
Tom was the only one in the room .
I saw the girl swimming in the river .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what time it is .
He asked me two questions .
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday .
I must have forgotten it .
I didn &apos;t want to talk to anyone .
What will happen to her ?
Who is this woman ?
Do you know how to get to Tom &apos;s house ?
I don &apos;t like the house he lives in .
I &apos;ll try to say it in French .
Tom wondered where Mary was and what she was doing .
I knew it would happen .
Are you sure they can do this ?
What &apos;s the matter ? Just tell me .
What is the bad news ?
Tom and I are friends .
The doctor advised me to drink more milk .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to sleep on the bus .
Where are my clothes ?
Do you really want to talk about that now ?
She has been ill for three weeks .
Tom knows the secret .
I &apos;ve got two brothers .
I don &apos;t like seeing Tom sad .
Tom spent many years in prison .
They didn &apos;t feel like playing any more .
They know who you are .
There was no need for you to do that .
We had hardly waited for five minutes when the bus came .
Tom ought to stop doing that .
These apples are for Tom .
The old man lives by himself .
Who else knows about your secret ?
Tom wanted to sit next to Mary .
&quot; Do you think he &apos;ll come ? &quot; &quot; I hope not . &quot;
Tom wants to get a driver &apos;s license .
You haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
We &apos;re here .
Tom is taller than his brother .
My life has changed .
Tom has already decided where to go .
Tom has already decided .
Tom was in Boston last week , wasn &apos;t he ?
Tom didn &apos;t have anything to say on that subject .
I have to write a letter .
Why are you always late for school ?
Tom is as old as I am .
Did Tom say he needed to do that ?
I didn &apos;t know that at the time .
Do you want to go to Australia ?
What do you want , anyway ?
I have one brother and two sisters .
He will be back in a couple of days .
What are you still doing here ?
Please wait here .
Tom will try it .
I spoke to him about it on the telephone .
I love studying languages .
Tom asked Mary if she was busy .
I &apos;m making coffee .
Why aren &apos;t you doing that ?
Let Tom finish .
I haven &apos;t yet made plans for next weekend .
I &apos;m still thinking about it .
I should probably tell Tom I &apos;m busy .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want anything to drink .
Tom likes it here .
It &apos;s raining there .
Would you like to eat something ?
Where will you go ?
All of my children live in Boston .
You &apos;re beginning to worry me .
You must go home .
She knows the truth .
That is his car .
I don &apos;t quite know how it happened .
I &apos;ve got bad news for you .
I heard Tom &apos;s voice .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
Does he have a dog ?
These are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Tom asked Mary how much money she had .
He is good at playing tennis .
Get out of there .
Tom said you were hungry .
Look at how white Tom &apos;s teeth are .
I &apos;m seeing Tom again on Monday .
It won &apos;t be as fun as you think .
Tom usually drinks coffee without sugar .
That &apos;s all she wrote .
This apple is very red .
I have no idea how it works .
Tom knew .
Do you know how long it &apos;ll take ?
I knew Tom was going to do that .
I am taking a couple of days off .
Since it &apos;s raining , I won &apos;t do that today .
I don &apos;t know if you remember me .
She has a brother in Tokyo .
I don &apos;t want to do that , but I have to .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see me like that .
Do you want to play with me ?
I used to live near Tom .
Tom works in Boston .
Do you have my money or not ?
I often read .
This book is easy enough for them to read .
This morning it was very cold .
Tom seemed worried .
Do you think such a thing is possible ?
I want to thank you for coming here today .
Don &apos;t tell Tom where you live .
Tom &apos;s mad .
I like winter .
He heard someone calling for help .
My friends are very important to me .
Was Tom in Boston last week ?
That doesn &apos;t mean that I &apos;ll stop doing it .
Tom thinks about Mary all the time .
Tom took a break .
Tom hasn &apos;t been able to go to school for three weeks .
I am able to read English .
You &apos;re trying too hard .
They have no more wine .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to thank us .
I get the picture .
She asked him to marry her .
Why did you come to Japan ?
Tom will do his best .
I am very pleased with my new house .
I should &apos;ve become a teacher .
I &apos;ll come alone .
I think you have made a mistake .
You can &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
She is proud of never having been late for school .
When are you going to quit smoking ?
When I entered his room , I found him reading a book .
I study French after dinner every day .
Tom knows my wife .
That &apos;s not going to help .
How long will it stop there ?
That &apos;s a question no one knows the answer to .
Tom gave me something that I needed .
I have to get home .
He lives all by himself in the country .
I will never forget the day when I first met him .
We &apos;re playing baseball after work today .
It &apos;s likely that she &apos;ll succeed .
He looks strong .
Tom wants Mary to know he likes her a lot .
Tom is going to be happy here .
You seem to enjoy doing that .
My name &apos;s Tom , too .
Don &apos;t make Tom do that .
Did Tom make it ?
It sounds like Tom .
I should &apos;ve stayed home .
I don &apos;t know the reason why she isn &apos;t coming .
Tom ought to stop smoking .
No one was at home .
I don &apos;t know either of his brothers .
Tom is a very good student .
Give me a little time .
It is exactly three o &apos;clock now .
Do you want to study French ?
It &apos;s been a long time since we last saw each other .
I used to do that , but I don &apos;t do it anymore .
Tom and Mary are waiting outside .
A lot can happen in a year .
I &apos;m not going with you .
I &apos;m in pain .
Why do you say things like that ?
Tom said he was going to Australia .
Tom told us he couldn &apos;t win .
He is as poor as can be .
Even if everyone else does that , I won &apos;t .
What are you doing tomorrow ?
It &apos;s true that she &apos;s dead .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any better .
As soon as she is ready , give me a call .
What is in this box ?
I haven &apos;t slept well recently .
I &apos;d like to know the reason why Tom isn &apos;t here .
How long did you stay ?
Tom does everything very quickly .
This is a message for Tom .
I &apos;m disappointed in you , Tom .
I &apos;m from the city .
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake .
I shouldn &apos;t have drunk so much beer last night .
You have changed quite a lot .
I enjoy being a teacher .
You &apos;re funny .
You still have to pay for it .
You should read as many books as you can .
Please give me the letter .
I &apos;m very busy today .
She asked me for help .
Let me hear it .
That wasn &apos;t your decision to make .
I haven &apos;t found it yet .
Tom should leave now .
I want to stay in Boston for a few more days .
It &apos;s not worth it .
I don &apos;t know whether to believe him or not .
It wasn &apos;t my idea .
It makes little difference .
Is that going to be OK ?
Are you guys sure about this ?
Why didn &apos;t anyone come ?
We shouldn &apos;t have done that .
It is pretty cold today .
Tom saw me do that .
I ate as little as possible .
This chair is light .
Do you think that I &apos;m not trying my best ?
I have a great deal to do tonight .
Tom has more books than I do .
Tom may not know French .
I &apos;d like to stay a little longer .
He is still angry .
Tom is working at a bank .
Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
What happened after we left ?
We don &apos;t know why he had to leave .
Tom has started going to church .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t have done that .
It &apos;s great .
Tom was eating .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Tom &apos;s party .
I don &apos;t think I know Tom .
Where can I buy apples ?
This is our last chance .
I was out all day .
Tom has a lot of money , but he &apos;s not happy .
Do you think anyone can see me ?
We meet sometimes at the shop .
Tom came home earlier than Mary expected .
Tom looked at Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything .
Both of my parents do not play golf .
Tom is listening to music in his room .
I want to buy a new bicycle .
This book is very good except for a few mistakes .
I know what time you said to be there , but I wasn &apos;t able to be there at that time .
Tom is a good singer .
I don &apos;t have as much experience as you .
Tom likes not only Mary but Alice as well .
I &apos;ll do whatever I have to do .
I need a driver to take me home .
I &apos;m important .
I enjoyed talking to him .
What does the cat want ?
It &apos;s up to us to do it .
They &apos;re walking without shoes .
I &apos;ll ask Tom to meet you tomorrow at three o &apos;clock .
Who would you like to speak to ?
Tom and Mary have decided to get married next month .
You are expected to do a good job .
Do you have a lot of time ?
I always thought Tom and Mary made a good couple .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary everything .
These are for you , Tom .
That &apos;s all you need .
You can have as many as you want .
In Japan , all children go to school .
I know what you do .
I couldn &apos;t help but cry .
No one but Tom does that .
I am not busy now .
Tom showed me a picture of the food they had eaten .
Tom knows this place .
I spent the weekend with friends .
Tom knows something we don &apos;t .
Come on , trust me .
Tom has told us a lot about you .
Tom could hardly believe him .
I don &apos;t know why they do it .
Tom left a few minutes early .
I want that job .
We both know that .
Let &apos;s do that again .
Tom seemed to be quite busy .
I will give you the money tomorrow .
I can carry that for you .
Tom is a little younger than your daughter .
Have you ever seen Tom do that before ?
We &apos;ll do it when we have time .
I can tell my best friend anything .
Tell them what happened .
Tom is up .
You can &apos;t be hungry . You &apos;ve just had dinner .
Do you want to learn French ?
When I was a child , I used to go to the beach every summer .
Tom left Australia three days ago .
We took a walk in the park .
Let &apos;s go to the beach .
You know it doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;m not rich enough to buy that .
You must not give up hope .
Your answer doesn &apos;t make sense .
Put it over there .
Tom was home alone .
Come back here .
I know what you &apos;re after .
Tom asked for a glass of water .
Excuse me , but may I use the phone ?
Take your hands off me .
I put it in your room .
He put some sugar and milk in his tea .
I feel so cold .
We started to walk .
I just want people to like me .
Do you like the apartment ?
That &apos;s not what we have to do .
He &apos;s going to love this .
I &apos;m not surprised to hear that .
Tom doesn &apos;t want anything to drink .
Tom likes to play tennis , too .
Tom says he can &apos;t wait any longer .
I want to be a teacher when I grow up .
Why can &apos;t animals talk ?
I heard that Tom and Mary will get married in October .
I &apos;m not lonely anymore .
I wish I were young again .
Tom took Mary with him .
This book is interesting to read .
Tom was only in Australia for a couple of weeks .
They stayed friends .
Tom really likes Mary .
I still love you very much .
I &apos;d like to see you this afternoon .
Go away before they see you here .
We can still talk to Tom .
The students ought to study more .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know that Mary could speak French .
You need help .
We will visit my grandfather this week .
I can &apos;t stand it any longer .
What did Tom tell you about me ?
What &apos;ll you drink , Tom ?
You &apos;re going to be so happy here .
My father died four years ago .
Tom plans to go by himself .
Are you certain about that ?
I met him on my way home .
I can read them all .
There was nobody there .
I &apos;d prefer not to speak French .
Tom was looking for you .
This never happened .
Give me another beer .
Tom would be able to do that .
Tom &apos;s dog is very big .
You &apos;re big enough to do that by yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
You need a plan .
Where can I find a hospital ?
I was very busy this week .
Tom doesn &apos;t know a thing about me .
Is there someone who could help me ?
I &apos;ve often been there .
Tom may not be doing that .
He said , &quot; Leave me alone . &quot;
Tom was surprised by Mary .
I like to play music written by my friends .
It &apos;s not deep enough .
Tom doesn &apos;t have much choice .
Did you say something ?
Tom knew how to do that .
What are you going to do this evening ?
Is he your teacher ?
He was expected to make a decision .
Be kind to old people .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s job ?
I don &apos;t want to be told what to do .
I want that car .
Tom asked Mary where she &apos;d been .
I asked Tom why he did it .
I thought you &apos;d be too busy to see me .
You &apos;re new here .
They &apos;re now alone .
I hope I haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
Leave my camera alone .
Maybe she can tell you more .
All of the students were present .
I quit smoking three years ago .
I think this book is easy .
He had few teeth .
Are you going to be here long ?
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston .
Your mother has always loved you .
I think we &apos;re fine .
Why are you on this ship ?
Tom made us do it .
I just want to dance .
Tom got nothing .
Tom likes being alone .
I &apos;ll catch you later .
I think there &apos;s no point in trying to convince her .
I don &apos;t want to work here anymore .
I have no money with me .
How did you guys first meet each other ?
Could you please stop singing ?
Your question is very hard to answer .
Is that a cat ?
You &apos;re welcome to stay as long as you want .
Did you talk to Tom ?
Tom has a pretty good idea why Mary isn &apos;t here now .
My father has been dead for ten years .
I don &apos;t want to do this with you .
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised that Mary didn &apos;t like John .
Why are we still talking about this ?
I should &apos;ve called a doctor .
His father was a policeman .
Tom and Mary worried about their children .
We have a lot of work to do .
Tom took the job .
Where is he ?
You &apos;ll get one .
It &apos;s raining again !
I don &apos;t know why Tom got sick .
Tom isn &apos;t angry .
I never eat meat .
I am very happy with it .
His little sister is very cute , isn &apos;t she ?
I hate people who talk like that .
It &apos;s all very simple .
Tom will need some help .
Tom knows I &apos;m here .
She &apos;s in danger .
Maybe I should study French .
Tom put his hat back on .
How many other girls have you said that to ?
I met her in the winter three years ago .
She &apos;s a woman now .
I used to do that every day .
I know you aren &apos;t that stupid .
Tom knows that Mary loves him .
We were supposed to be here two weeks ago .
She gave me her phone number .
This desk is good .
Both Tom and Mary are sitting over there .
He was poor and could not buy it .
Do you believe me ?
I &apos;m not going to help Tom .
Tom said he would come to the party .
Tom appears to be very smart .
Tom asked me if I really wanted to do that by myself .
She has a cold .
Tom has already decided to stay .
I &apos;m very sorry I came home so late .
We &apos;re different .
Tom knows his stuff .
Someone called .
I have to borrow some money .
Aren &apos;t you new here ?
Tom and Mary got married in Boston three years ago .
Tom became popular .
Tom and Mary sat on the sofa together watching TV .
How long do we have ?
I kept my mouth shut .
Tom is through .
I &apos;ll do whatever I have to .
He began to cry .
Tom is really very smart .
Where can I take you ?
I don &apos;t think there will be any problems .
If Tom had seen anything , he would have told us .
The trouble is that we are short of money .
Don &apos;t open this door .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s good .
Tom won &apos;t change .
Nobody needs me .
That happens every day .
Let Tom speak .
What do you think Tom wants ?
Tom doesn &apos;t understand you .
Do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
I will stay at home .
I had a good night &apos;s sleep .
I asked her to go to a movie with me .
I thought that I saw something .
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on the way to work .
He always takes his time in everything that he does .
Tom might go .
Will you go by train ?
Are you sure Tom knows what he &apos;s doing ?
What do you think of this one ?
Is that what you &apos;d like ?
He asked me where my uncle lived .
Where will you have lunch today ?
She &apos;s older than him .
I &apos;m sorry that I can &apos;t come today .
He seems kind .
I love sitting on the beach .
Tom should win .
Do you have children already ?
I don &apos;t read .
I think both of them are right .
Did you understand Tom ?
Tom and Mary are so happy you &apos;re here .
Tom may not want to do that .
Tom thought I knew Mary .
I know you didn &apos;t do what you were supposed to do .
I wish I had helped Tom at that time .
I &apos;m not her type .
Tom sat between Mary and her husband .
I was thinking about buying a new camera .
We knew it all along .
That &apos;s part of my job .
Your father is tall .
They have gone to Europe .
What are they after ?
This is not my day .
They had only one child .
Can you meet him ?
He never keeps his word .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Australia .
I don &apos;t know where he lives .
He gave me not just advice , but money as well .
He could not help laughing at her jokes .
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice .
Tom said something to Mary in French .
Tom said they were waiting for him .
Who left the door open ?
I &apos;ve got a job .
Tom , Mary and John are all here .
Do Tom and Mary get along ?
Is there a telephone anywhere ?
A new love is like a new life .
I can &apos;t translate this sentence .
Tom has left , but Mary is still here .
I can &apos;t talk .
You don &apos;t look very well . Are you OK ?
Do a better job next time .
That &apos;s what Tom likes to do .
Can I sit here ?
I call her pretty often .
Tom looked very tired when I saw him yesterday .
I need a computer .
He caught three fish .
You are making history .
Tom is like Mary .
Thanks . I appreciate it .
Tom refused to tell us what had happened .
You &apos;ve disappointed us .
I &apos;ll call you tonight .
Why do we need to learn this ?
Do you think you &apos;ll ever get married again ?
I almost won .
It &apos;s fun to play baseball .
I knew you &apos;d be here .
Tom has to go shopping now .
I spent my vacation in Australia .
I came as fast as I could .
My back still hurts .
I bought a lot of books .
Here &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
Can I ask why ?
A teacher should never laugh at a student who makes a mistake .
When he was young , he sometimes played soccer .
Both sisters are very beautiful .
Everybody knows she can speak English well .
Why did you want to talk to Tom ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom could speak French .
We know that everything we need to do is on the list .
He suddenly fell ill .
Tom knows what he wants to say .
Have courage .
Could you go there and get it ?
When is Tom going to come over ?
Tom &apos;s doing OK .
It was a good decision .
Did you already do your homework ?
Tom refused to talk to me .
I &apos;d like to go with Tom .
Tom likes this .
I don &apos;t want to live like this .
It &apos;s all over between us .
Nobody wants Tom .
I waited for her for a really long time .
Why are you crying ?
Can I take your picture ?
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening .
Tom wondered how long he &apos;d have to wait for Mary .
Tom said he thought that the room was too small .
One should do one &apos;s best .
Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night ?
Why did you kill Tom ?
Are you a teacher ?
Tom comes home every day for lunch .
I can &apos;t see in this light .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom really loved Mary .
I study about two hours every day .
Tom just wants to have fun .
Why don &apos;t you shut up ?
Just between us , that &apos;s my girlfriend .
You never come over anymore .
I &apos;ve already heard this story .
You &apos;re very busy .
I promised .
No one knows why .
I knew this moment would come .
I hate dancing .
Tom was my friend .
That &apos;s impossible for me .
Are you angry because of what I said ?
What does Tom want from us ?
What did Tom find ?
I had to work on Sunday .
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party .
Let &apos;s get some lunch .
I don &apos;t care much for coffee .
You &apos;re the only person I know who can probably answer this question .
Tom and Mary are rich .
You got hurt , didn &apos;t you ?
What does Tom want Mary to do ?
I &apos;m working on a new book .
He &apos;ll make a good lawyer sooner or later .
Tom isn &apos;t that stupid .
If you &apos;re looking for a job , call me .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary was reading .
I didn &apos;t like my name when I was young .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop doing that .
Do you really want Tom to do this for you ?
What else did Tom say ?
I &apos;ve already read that novel .
All the money was gone .
You &apos;re like family .
She has been sick for a week .
Tom is too busy .
Tom knows that you know .
I had no reason to stay .
Thank you for doing this , Tom .
I want to stay here with you .
Who was it ?
He won &apos;t be missed .
I &apos;d like to have dinner with you .
Are you sure Tom &apos;s going to be there ?
I think you like me .
It is very hot today .
They won &apos;t find you .
It &apos;s a good thing I came here .
I guess we could try doing that .
Tom wouldn &apos;t run .
What makes you think Tom does that ?
She showed him to his seat .
Tom looked very busy .
Was it fun ?
Would you like to play with Tom ?
Is there somebody you want to talk to ?
I &apos;ll do anything .
You didn &apos;t need to take a taxi .
If it had not been for her help , you would never have done it .
Tom says it &apos;s hot .
I am playing guitar .
Tom knows the truth .
Let &apos;s hurry so we can catch the bus .
I started reading the book .
Tom and I don &apos;t want that .
If I had known her address , I could have visited her .
I wish I could stay here with you today .
Tom began to sing .
Tom took a look around the room .
I feel fine .
What language is spoken in America ?
I must go right away .
I will find you a good doctor .
I don &apos;t believe that anymore .
Tom will soon be a father .
Tom told me that you &apos;d do that .
Tom used to do that a lot , but he seldom does anymore .
I was away .
You were there for me when I needed you .
I &apos;ll be here from 2 : 30 until 6 : 30 .
Tom is the only one who knows for sure .
I &apos;m going to stay at home tonight .
This is not a small problem .
Tom seems happy .
There &apos;s no way I &apos;m going to leave you alone here .
That should be possible .
That &apos;s very good .
Where have you gone ?
Tom hasn &apos;t eaten a thing all day .
He looks very tired .
Tell me it isn &apos;t true .
May I ask why it is that you don &apos;t want to talk about it ?
Tom and I want to go home .
Please wait five minutes .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think it was possible .
The boy cannot keep quiet for ten minutes .
This is really big .
Get off of Tom .
You are off the point .
Your name &apos;s not Tom , is it ?
He has a lot more money than I have .
Are you happy ?
I know where you can find Tom .
I wish I had more .
Please write this down .
I never should &apos;ve listened to you .
Tom just ate .
It just doesn &apos;t seem possible .
I knew we should &apos;ve stayed at home .
I was angry because he was late .
That isn &apos;t really going to happen , is it ?
I think we &apos;d better wait for another thirty minutes .
How late did you stay at the party last night ?
I don &apos;t have time now .
She took a walk in the park .
I haven &apos;t spoken to Tom .
I &apos;m going to Boston this weekend .
Can I ask why not ?
I know Boston .
I was going to write to you , but I forgot .
I don &apos;t have it .
Tom is in a really good mood today .
This sounds very interesting .
Why do you hate me so much ?
Can someone please help me ?
Please bill me .
Tom would leave .
There &apos;s something I have to tell you .
What did you do then ?
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to help him .
I was trying to talk to you .
I don &apos;t know where Tom &apos;s office is .
You didn &apos;t need to hurry .
We can &apos;t see it .
She came in through the door .
I can &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s not just about the money .
What &apos;ll you have to drink ?
I understand this .
It seems like there &apos;s no money left .
Tom helped the old man across the street .
Do you want to go somewhere else ?
I can &apos;t let Tom see me like this .
What Tom was doing looked like fun .
I can &apos;t open the door .
Are they friends ?
He has three older sisters .
Can you believe what he said ?
How are things going ?
I didn &apos;t know Tom very well .
I guess that &apos;s impossible .
Have you told Tom what to buy ?
He is a very good speaker of English .
What is this car doing here ?
When did you get this ?
I absolutely agree with you .
She kept him waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got my hands full here .
They &apos;ve lost so much .
I must know the truth about him .
How long does it take from here to your house on foot ?
I love this school .
Let me call Tom .
It &apos;s not like I &apos;m not trying .
We sure don &apos;t want that .
Tom found the key that he thought he &apos;d lost .
I like to write in French .
I &apos;m not interested in this .
This is a pencil .
That did me good .
Call me if you need my help .
I hope you and Tom will like it here .
I don &apos;t know any more than you do .
Tom left for Australia yesterday .
You &apos;re going to love this .
Why do people go to the movies ?
I don &apos;t need a doctor .
I would rather you hadn &apos;t told him the truth .
Come over here .
I &apos;ve seen this picture before .
We are crying .
I can &apos;t figure out why he didn &apos;t tell the truth .
We have been here for three weeks .
Tell Tom why you didn &apos;t do that .
Why didn &apos;t you eat ?
I love pizza .
Maybe I just need some time alone .
I want some food .
Why don &apos;t you stop ?
Tom told me to give you this .
Don &apos;t you want to go with us ?
Did he tell you anything ?
I cannot get in touch with him .
Tom has said he has to do that .
I can &apos;t wait all day .
Why didn &apos;t you bring your wife to the party ?
Where &apos;s the boss ?
Tom is with him .
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston .
Tom , I &apos;m home .
She should help her mother .
Would you mind telling me where you &apos;re going ?
I &apos;m in here .
It &apos;s only a dream .
This is the best restaurant in our area .
You &apos;re quite smart .
Tom wanted to know if Mary had a boyfriend .
I want to go to Boston .
I liked that book .
He was sick , so he did not go out .
I have the money .
We kissed each other .
Tom saw Mary waiting .
What are you going to do with it ?
Is it large enough ?
Tom can &apos;t make up his mind .
I want to marry you .
Tom never was very interesting .
I &apos;ll give you until 2 : 30 .
I think Tom is alive .
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
I can &apos;t just do nothing .
How long have you been abroad ?
I don &apos;t like that part of town .
I &apos;m not going to be afraid anymore .
Whose house is this ?
I met Tom at his house .
I don &apos;t understand French at all .
My family is in Boston .
That bag is mine .
Tom has to follow our rules .
I asked what was wrong .
Tom says he wants to go to Boston .
I &apos;m glad to see you .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t like this color .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll be here .
I didn &apos;t know you could cook so well .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice are all from Boston .
Why did you guys leave ?
I only heard the end of Tom &apos;s speech .
I think Tom will like this .
Tom loves telling the story about how he and Mary met .
You should call your father as soon as possible .
Where are we exactly ?
There &apos;s no one like you .
Tom lived in Australia .
Tom said nobody else was there .
We live here .
We &apos;re quite drunk .
Tom thinks that it &apos;s going to rain .
Tom likes to go to Boston .
When is Tom going to do that ?
What difference does that make ?
You don &apos;t need to thank me .
She wants to know who sent the flowers .
The doctor advised me not to smoke too much .
You can find somebody else to help you .
Why are you out here ?
Please speak slowly , so I can understand you .
What am I going to do about it ?
I have another idea .
They &apos;re empty .
We are going to visit our uncle next Sunday .
I think Tom needs me .
I &apos;m in a really bad mood .
Tom hardly ever talks about his work .
This isn &apos;t a new car .
I &apos;m speaking from experience .
My eyes get tired very easily .
He often goes to the library by car .
What do you want to do in the afternoon ?
Tom looked upset .
Tom has gotten fat .
When was the last time you played tennis with Tom ?
Tom worked for three hours straight .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
We have to stop .
Someone left the water running .
I &apos;ll wait for you .
We &apos;re eating apples .
You have no idea what happened , do you ?
If you really don &apos;t want to come , you don &apos;t have to .
I talked to my friends about it .
How do I know you ?
The old church by the lake is very beautiful .
I want to go to Boston with Tom .
I promised not to say anything .
I can &apos;t find my shoes .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
Don &apos;t leave your glasses on the table .
Have Tom do that .
Tom still hasn &apos;t arrived .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know my name .
I &apos;m taking a break .
Tom and Mary both should know better .
Why do we have to help Tom ?
I called Tom yesterday .
Tom felt fine .
I found no money left in my pocket .
If you have questions , ask away .
Here &apos;s the address .
I like cake .
You did not come to school yesterday .
Tom has to come with me .
&quot; What was that ? &quot; &quot; Nothing . &quot;
I &apos;m home .
I want to be loved .
I think we can do it .
I seldom speak to him .
Why don &apos;t you read a book ?
I got here as fast as I could .
Tom started that .
Did you understand it ?
You &apos;re in no danger .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I took a vacation .
Thanks to you , I &apos;ve learned a lot .
Where did you come from ?
Do you know what I want ?
We &apos;re a big family .
The song was a big hit .
What do we want here ?
Tom never had to worry about money .
I can &apos;t see everything .
My cat is hungry .
Has anyone ever told you they loved you ?
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
Some people like cats , and others prefer dogs .
Tom &apos;s brother &apos;s name is John .
We &apos;ll be out of here by this time tomorrow .
That &apos;s actually a good idea .
I &apos;m satisfied .
You shouldn &apos;t make fun of Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t want the job .
My mother lives by herself .
I didn &apos;t know Tom would be here today .
I couldn &apos;t remember anything .
My train left at six and arrived at ten .
I haven &apos;t read the report .
Mary is wearing a new dress today .
I wish I had time for a girlfriend .
It doesn &apos;t look too hard .
Tom is supposed to be in Boston .
Where are we right now ?
Tom died the next day .
Tom came to see us yesterday afternoon .
I live right down the road .
What do you plan on doing tonight ?
They ought to have arrived there by this time .
May I use that ?
Tom came to see you this afternoon .
We aren &apos;t very hungry yet .
Tom is still looking for work .
Tom is no longer afraid .
This is a dog .
You know why I left .
There &apos;s a table .
It &apos;s on the house .
Does he have money ?
What is his age ?
They made me wait for a long time .
Do you have it ?
I can &apos;t let you do that .
Please wait for five minutes .
I don &apos;t want Tom to do that .
If only I could sing well .
I never talked to Tom .
I &apos;ll go to Tom .
When was the last time you went to the beach ?
It really doesn &apos;t matter .
Tom always says what he thinks .
She might be taller than you .
I &apos;m sure my passport is in this room somewhere .
That isn &apos;t good .
We ought to leave now .
I wasn &apos;t afraid .
Today both of you are staying home .
I can speak French a little .
What good does that do us ?
My father works for a bank .
The girl doesn &apos;t know how to do it .
Tom found something .
I thought I told you not to come here .
He takes after his father .
How about a cup of tea or something , if you aren &apos;t in a hurry ?
Tom &apos;s parents are John and Mary .
I found somebody .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Everything appears to be going well .
Why are you reading that book ?
I &apos;m very hungry today .
You look good in that suit .
He was loved by everybody .
You may come if you like .
The police found Tom &apos;s bicycle .
I read a few books last week .
I bought my sister a new hat .
No one was more surprised than me .
They want to help .
Tom is far from happy .
Do you want to take this one ?
You &apos;ll miss Tom .
That was very good .
Are those the people you saw yesterday ?
He was angry with his daughter .
I can &apos;t stand Tom .
We need to eat .
I wonder whether or not Tom knows how to speak French .
He sometimes makes dinner for us .
I did it on purpose .
Don &apos;t you believe me ?
What made Tom do that ?
I don &apos;t think Tom can hear me .
Tom realized Mary was serious .
Tom is your brother , isn &apos;t he ?
I speak a little French .
Tom taught me that .
Tom looks like he always does .
I took your word for it .
Tom wouldn &apos;t eat .
Tom doesn &apos;t think I &apos;ll do that .
Tom won &apos;t know the answer to that .
This &apos;ll be great .
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
Are you certain you &apos;ve made the right decision ?
I tried everything .
I didn &apos;t think it would be that easy .
Tom seems hungry .
Would you like to go for a walk ?
Do you feel like talking about it ?
I &apos;ll go and look for Tom .
You were great .
I want that more than anything .
Hey , what &apos;re you doing tomorrow night ?
I &apos;d be surprised if they asked me to give a speech .
I spoke to Tom myself .
Do I have to do it right away ?
It &apos;s nice to have friends .
Our cat is missing .
The old man asked me a favor .
Did Tom hit Mary ?
No one knows what has happened to him .
It was time to leave .
Tom looked worried .
They had no money left .
Tom dropped Mary off at the station .
Why do I have to talk to Tom ?
I want you to come with us .
Tom isn &apos;t where he wants to be .
Tom didn &apos;t have much money .
Go and ask Tom .
Tom arrived home at 2 : 30 .
This hat is too big for you .
Don &apos;t come in here .
You never seem to get sick .
You can wait outside .
Tom is the one we want .
What makes you so sure Tom wants to stay ?
That &apos;s how I like it .
Tom has a lot of money in the bank .
Tom lived there for many years .
That story is a famous one that everyone knows .
She waited for hours and hours .
You &apos;re really not supposed to be here .
Is this your opinion ?
I &apos;ll give you one last chance .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk about Mary .
I can see Tom .
I &apos;m not ready yet .
You &apos;re the woman I love .
Tom knows me .
Boston is great .
If you don &apos;t want it , I &apos;ll eat it .
Tom sent a message to Mary .
They know your name .
We don &apos;t have a plan .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was married .
You love children , don &apos;t you ?
Tom may have been sick .
Tom thought that Mary would like to go to Boston to see John .
Tom died doing what he loved .
Tom is very smart .
I come from Boston .
What &apos;ll you give me ?
She may not remember me , but I do remember her .
Could you translate this sentence for me ?
I only have time for coffee .
He cannot swim .
Tom is not my friend anymore .
Are they sisters ?
I &apos;ll see you when you get here .
I &apos;m on my way to work now .
I &apos;m off beer .
He sat and listened to the radio .
I think Tom must be hungry .
I have not seen much of him recently .
I am eating lunch with my sister .
Tom felt that there was no need to hurry .
I don &apos;t remember him saying that .
Tom might know something .
I &apos;d like to see them both .
I want you to leave me alone .
Does Mary have a boyfriend , yet ?
When did you come to Japan ?
I &apos;ll fix it up with him .
I &apos;m going to buy some bread .
This is all I know .
I haven &apos;t seen him for a long time .
You have to keep your promise .
I don &apos;t know who you &apos;re talking about .
Do you happen to know his name ?
You should tell him the truth .
Tom stood there looking at me .
Tom wanted to be rich .
I don &apos;t agree with Tom .
I know you really like Tom .
Will you please shut the door ?
My money was stolen .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary is here .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that .
I have a girlfriend back home .
I &apos;m not happy .
I remember seeing her once .
What kind of person would do that kind of thing ?
I just have a couple of questions .
Is that Tom ?
I did that all the time in high school .
Everything was better in the past .
He lives in a very small room .
I need you in my life .
I &apos;ve heard that from a lot of people .
Don &apos;t ask for money .
I &apos;ll be home alone all night .
He is known to all the people in the town .
Don &apos;t thank me now .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to rain today .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me he was married .
I like Tom , too .
Tom wasn &apos;t even there .
That &apos;s my fault .
Tom was the last one to get here .
Tom &apos;s well .
Are you angry at me ?
Tom is surprised .
I think you &apos;re stupid .
Tom said that he thought the room was too small .
How deep is this lake ?
Let me have a look .
He is not stupid .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to know about it .
When would you like me to come over ?
I saw you .
I won &apos;t close the door .
Tom and I &apos;ve been friends for many years .
Give me my beer .
Would you like to go abroad ?
Do you want the good news or the bad news ?
These days I &apos;m very busy .
Give me another cup of coffee .
Tom looked back .
Tom knows what he likes .
He &apos;s short and fat .
Do you want me to tell you why ?
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
Everyone is talking about Tom .
You should write a novel .
You can &apos;t help Tom .
Tom is always hungry .
You &apos;ve arrived too early .
Tom is rarely in a good mood .
Tom goes to school on foot .
I &apos;m glad I stayed in Boston for a week longer .
Tom looked about .
Tom will be in his office all afternoon .
That &apos;s what I want to understand .
I can &apos;t take it any more .
I can &apos;t remember exactly where Tom lives .
I thought you were off today .
He fell asleep under the tree .
I didn &apos;t get the job .
Tell us who you are .
I believe Tom is right .
We &apos;re in Australia now .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do .
It &apos;s clean .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d be able to do that .
I won &apos;t go there anymore .
Did you get an answer from Tom ?
When do you return home ?
I was on leave .
Tom broke down and started to cry .
They &apos;re there alone .
How much time do we have ?
What do you think that is ?
He is still alive .
You must not give up .
Why don &apos;t you go to Tom &apos;s ?
My father usually comes home at six .
Are you angry with me ?
The newspaper had very good pictures .
I was really busy .
What &apos;s wrong ?
What do you want to do about it ?
I can speak French better than Tom can .
We don &apos;t know where Tom is .
I want a friend .
I haven &apos;t met him before .
Does this not please you ?
We know you &apos;re still there .
Tom told Mary .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Tom was able to help Mary .
Tom &apos;s impossible .
Why am I here ?
No one asked for your help .
Would you like a cup of tea ?
They &apos;re new .
We haven &apos;t even tried .
We want to talk .
Where &apos;s my shirt ?
Don &apos;t you want Tom to do that for you ?
How long is this pencil ?
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom and Mary are going to get married .
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a moment .
Tom knew this .
When did you begin studying English ?
He wants to come .
Tom loved Mary .
Tom seemed smart .
When can I visit you ?
It &apos;s getting late .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t talk to you .
He said nothing .
Tom wants to go to the movies .
English is not easy , but it is interesting .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t have a lot of money on him .
My father is in the hospital now .
They failed the exam .
We cannot thank you enough .
We miss you a lot .
Why do you want to live in Australia ?
Tom was sick .
I wish I were by your side .
I had a dog when I was a kid .
We don &apos;t have that .
The car is in the way . Please move it .
I said that .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary was there .
Tom and Mary are planning to get married .
Your hands are cold .
We have to do something , Tom .
Do you have anything to read ?
How &apos;s Tom today ?
You &apos;re part of this .
Everyone is trying his best .
You look happy today .
You &apos;re too good for me .
I don &apos;t like you anymore .
You did that on purpose .
How does Tom look ?
Tom has bad eyes .
Here we are !
Does it hurt here ?
Where is my son ?
I &apos;m hardly ever home .
We sometimes swim in the lake .
She wants him .
Tom seldom gets angry .
Tom said he &apos;d never been there before .
I really have to get this done today .
Is Tom awake yet ?
I &apos;ll ask my mother for money .
Many of you speak French , right ?
How much does it cost for one person ?
Tom was in a good mood .
Tom isn &apos;t that poor .
Why didn &apos;t Tom visit Boston ?
You can say whatever you want .
Were your mother and father home ?
Do you think it will fit here ?
I &apos;d like to ask you about Tom .
You &apos;ll lose everything .
Tom got very popular .
There is an old church in this town .
Don &apos;t give the dog anything to eat .
He is sure that he will succeed .
I &apos;m not afraid of death .
I have nothing else to do .
The little girl grew into a beautiful woman .
We should study .
How much money did you win ?
I want to help you .
Is Tom going to be OK ?
Is the road all right to drive on ?
I still have time .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that Mary is happy .
It &apos;s too hard .
Tom is in trouble .
Tom is too busy to help .
Tom said he &apos;s going to do that .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t plan to be there .
Tom lives somewhere around here .
I need some paper .
We were bored .
We want to talk to you .
It was that simple .
This is going to be great .
He doesn &apos;t have a family .
Why aren &apos;t you in Boston ?
My camera is different from yours .
May I have a glass of milk , please ?
Have you seen my glasses anywhere ?
How long do you need to stay in Boston ?
Tom and Mary sat together on the bus .
I &apos;ll write to you as soon as possible .
There &apos;s got to be a way .
Isn &apos;t Tom afraid ?
I forgot Tom knew how to read French .
&quot; Why did you do that ? &quot; &quot; I wanted to see what would happen . &quot;
There is no salt left .
Let &apos;s study English .
What kind of soup is this ?
We &apos;re shy .
Tom is in there with Mary and John .
People don &apos;t always tell the truth .
He &apos;s already left .
You &apos;d better go back home now .
The room was quiet .
Tom would be hurt if you said that .
Do you enjoy walking on the beach ?
Tom said he thought that he knew what the problem was .
The street is full of cars .
Give the keys to Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom likes it .
You don &apos;t look too happy .
When did you get to London ?
I found my book .
I believe you like your job .
Tom wasn &apos;t there .
I think we &apos;ll make it if we hurry .
We know Tom is here .
How &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
There is nothing in the world from which we can &apos;t learn something .
It &apos;s become dark .
I thought a lot about what Tom said .
Tom may come , but then again , he may not .
She is in a very good mood .
That &apos;s not a good idea .
I kept my word .
Tom &apos;s alive .
I &apos;ve never killed anyone .
The only question now is how we &apos;re going to get home .
Tom saw where Mary lives .
Tom said that you wanted to study abroad .
Tom and Mary have found something .
Tom was in pain .
Tom won &apos;t stay .
This car is my father &apos;s , but it &apos;ll soon be mine .
Let &apos;s see what Tom can do for us .
I &apos;ve had enough .
Do you know where you &apos;re going ?
I have a passport .
I found the game easy .
You should &apos;ve told me the truth .
No one comes to visit me anymore .
I need more money .
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary .
I like to do my homework .
The man who came to visit you didn &apos;t say who he was .
I wonder if Tom really meant what he said .
You could have come to me .
It is important for me .
Tom promised he &apos;d never do that again .
Tom is going out with Mary .
Tom told me that he &apos;d like to become a doctor .
How are you going ?
Tom isn &apos;t right .
It &apos;s still new to me .
Is it a nice place ?
It looks like you &apos;re on your own .
What did Tom do yesterday ?
I can drive a car , but Tom can &apos;t .
I &apos;d love to dance with you .
I know that she doesn &apos;t know who I am .
I just need to know you &apos;re OK .
Tom sat down between Mary and her husband .
I want to kiss you .
Do you agree ?
Tom slept in his office .
Tom waited a moment and then got up to leave .
Thank you for calling me on time .
Tom wants to spend time with Mary .
Where did you two first meet each other ?
She lives in the country .
Do it Monday .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary will come .
That &apos;s what I love about you .
Who are the two women over there ?
We know each other , but not all that well .
I have to go see Tom .
Don &apos;t play here .
What &apos;s Tom doing here again ?
We work from nine to five .
Why &apos;s Tom looking at me ?
Tom told me he was going to talk to Mary .
My parents will be proud of me .
Where are your children now ?
I &apos;m not free .
It &apos;s for you .
I don &apos;t think that he &apos;ll come .
You &apos;ll be happy again .
Tom got up at 6 : 30 as usual .
I fear nothing .
I know everybody here .
Is Tom out ?
I thought you were going out with Tom .
I often wonder if I will ever get married .
The window is closed .
Don &apos;t do anything .
You can &apos;t have this .
I don &apos;t have to ask anyone .
I &apos;d better drive you home .
Tom gave us a lot of food .
Tom hasn &apos;t said anything either .
I was up all night .
I &apos;m game .
I feel like another beer .
They will help .
She went to Germany for the purpose of studying music .
Tom didn &apos;t believe it at first .
Why are you reading this ?
This is what I have to do .
I don &apos;t have a picture of you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to go to school today .
I didn &apos;t hear it .
Tom didn &apos;t go home yesterday .
I &apos;m not going to make it .
I can always take the bus back to Boston , right ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t do what Mary asked him to do .
She was listening to music .
I play with him .
I just need more time with Tom .
I think Tom and Mary are going to be so happy together .
It &apos;s great to meet you .
We ask the teacher questions every day .
I have a lot of experience .
May I ask you what your name is ?
Aren &apos;t you a student here ?
Tom spoke quickly .
She lived there for many years .
Tom said he &apos;d come .
We &apos;ll help .
I know who to call when I need help .
Thank you for being here .
Tom no longer lives with his parents .
He is proud of his family .
Where are you going with this ?
She says she will call you later .
She went with him to Boston .
Make sure Tom comes .
We make every decision together .
Tom was in a bad mood .
Tom taught Mary how to read .
It &apos;s not Tom .
It was quite dark when I got home .
I &apos;ve never lived in Boston .
We drove across the city .
Tom and Mary want to learn French .
He is often absent from school .
What are you doing home ?
I &apos;ve never heard of such a thing .
Did you meet her ?
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents .
Tom is at home , isn &apos;t he ?
The world is a big place .
What &apos;s Tom drinking ?
He asked me to pass him the salt .
Don &apos;t be disappointed .
I &apos;ve just arrived at the station .
Is that for me ?
Don &apos;t drink from the bottle , please .
I know that , Tom .
He is always happy .
I have nothing to do with this matter .
Tom usually only wears his glasses when he &apos;s reading .
They have many students .
We had lunch .
Tom bought that camera because Mary thought it was the one he should buy .
I have seen that girl before .
Let me tell you a little about myself .
I was born there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about Mary &apos;s family .
Are you still interested ?
Please take a look at this picture .
We &apos;re cold .
Do you know anything ?
Tom knows he shouldn &apos;t do that .
They looked like they were about to kiss .
Tom thinks Mary is interested in John .
She eats lunch here from time to time .
I don &apos;t know who she is .
I &apos;ve bought a gift for Tom .
I &apos;ve never had to work very hard .
Tom used to read a lot .
If anyone can do it , it &apos;s you .
Tom looked out of the window .
My brother speaks very quickly .
I can &apos;t thank him enough .
That hurts .
Let &apos;s end this fast .
I want him to read this .
She &apos;s going to be in charge .
You can change it if you like .
I &apos;m new at this .
Tom and Mary are sick .
It doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
I think we can go on our way now .
I am a teacher , too .
I want that book .
I don &apos;t think that happened .
I &apos;ll be around back .
Those aren &apos;t mine .
It is necessary for you to stop smoking .
Tom opened the beer .
They love this song .
Did you go to London that day ?
We have made friends with Tom .
Someone is standing behind the wall .
Did Tom speak French to you ?
Tom wants to go out for a walk .
Nothing has to be done .
I &apos;ve never been spoken to like that .
Have you read that book ?
Have you finished reading the book ?
I &apos;ll be nice .
You know things are bad when they call Tom in to help .
I don &apos;t like working here .
I &apos;m not convinced that Tom is telling the truth .
The police were here .
I know your name .
She failed to keep her promise .
He should have done that long ago .
What did you hide ?
We &apos;re not getting any younger .
Tom now has a good reason to be happy .
I am not a Canadian .
I just finished .
She called for help .
The office seems very busy today .
I &apos;m very good at it .
I laughed so much , I thought I &apos;d die .
I am looking forward to seeing you .
Tom wants to talk to all of us .
Do you have any money left ?
I knew I &apos;d be able to do that by 2 : 30 .
Are you busy ?
Please give me some water .
I want to cook for you .
It makes all the children happy .
My parents don &apos;t like Tom .
I &apos;ve been here for three years .
There &apos;s a cake inside the box .
We &apos;re doing OK .
Tom would like to see you .
Tom should &apos;ve let me know earlier .
I &apos;ve got a few questions for you .
That girl isn &apos;t able to ride a bicycle .
I played guitar .
I &apos;ve already talked to Tom about that matter .
Do you think Tom is in Boston ?
Tom got dressed quickly .
What do you want me to do about this ?
You must start immediately .
I &apos;d like to see what you have in your hand .
How did you get Tom to do that for you ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to change .
This might be over soon .
Tom likes Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
Is this Tom &apos;s book ?
I &apos;ve known Tom longer than I &apos;ve known you .
Nobody can stop me !
Tom seems lost .
Have you known Tom long ?
I helped my father with the work .
Tom is my older brother .
I &apos;m very disappointed in you .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t go either .
Tom was too angry to speak .
This book is very heavy .
Mary doesn &apos;t love her husband .
I need to do something .
Why don &apos;t you all come with me ?
The old man sometimes talks to himself .
What else do you know about that ?
Where will your friends sleep ?
I &apos;m doing it for Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t want me to see what he &apos;s doing .
I &apos;m from a big family .
You &apos;d better go to bed at once .
I don &apos;t think I understand you .
He &apos;s my father .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to get married .
Tom stopped the car and got out .
He showed off his new watch .
Can you find it ?
May I see your passport ?
She is looking for a large apartment .
If you want , you can easily make it .
He had more than enough money .
I &apos;ll drive you to the airport .
The TV &apos;s on .
Tom got dressed .
That &apos;s what works .
Tom told Mary that he was in love with Alice .
It was nothing but a joke .
Tom called Mary up from the airport .
I don &apos;t like rice .
Are you going to be at this afternoon &apos;s meeting ?
It is easy to answer the question .
The kids are making too much noise .
I still haven &apos;t learned to drive a car .
There &apos;s no reason to do that .
How good was Tom today ?
I have at least ten books .
I should &apos;ve explained it better .
I want to eat something that I can only eat here .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing here .
Tom is sure to win .
We &apos;ll use what we have .
Tom has just left .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t going to be the one driving .
How long can you stay ?
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
The next morning , he was gone .
Tom was asked not to do that again .
Tell Tom to wait a moment .
I ate a lot of pizza .
I didn &apos;t need Tom .
He knows everything about Germany .
How do you know my name ?
I don &apos;t need anything now .
I wrote this song just for you .
Mary was thinking about her question .
Could this be love ?
Where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s hope .
I can &apos;t explain that .
She seems to be in love with my brother .
It doesn &apos;t matter when you come .
Tom didn &apos;t seem surprised .
Tom seems to be very sick .
I believe Tom can do that .
Have Tom do it .
I didn &apos;t need to do that .
Let Tom know we &apos;ve got a problem .
I had little choice .
Tom is from Boston .
Tom went outside .
Tom has two brothers .
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened .
How would you like your coffee ?
Let &apos;s buy this one .
Where did you find the keys ?
Tom and Mary were very kind to me .
It may break .
Tom might not need Mary &apos;s help .
We need rain .
Tom said that he was fine .
You &apos;re still young .
Tom keeps making the same mistake .
Have you ever gone to work on Sunday ?
Tom is taller than any of the other kids in his class .
I come from the future .
Tom had dinner by himself .
I don &apos;t think we want to know .
I have nothing more to say on the subject .
I missed the last bus and had to walk home in the rain .
We have no choice but to go .
Tom made me do the work .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t go .
Let me explain it once more , so you understand what I mean .
Are there any other questions ?
Tom actually got Mary to dance with him .
The building that I saw was very large .
Tom needs to stop doing that .
We usually go to the beach in the summer .
Did Tom tell you who his wife is ?
My name isn &apos;t Tom . It &apos;s John .
Tom has two brothers . They both live in Boston .
I gave the boy a book .
I &apos;ve had a good sleep .
He wants an apple .
I &apos;m playing with my friends .
I don &apos;t feel like doing anything today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t care .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re really here .
I &apos;d like to go out with you .
I want Tom to be happy .
I really enjoyed reading your story .
We have to make a decision .
I &apos;ll deal with this problem .
It &apos;ll be fine .
I called Tom .
Don &apos;t forget who you are .
Tom knows the city very well .
I won &apos;t stand for it .
What time do you expect me to be there ?
You &apos;re always busy .
Is there anyone here ?
Tom is quite good at cooking .
Tom is the same age as Mary .
Tom and Mary are still not talking to each other .
The bed takes up a lot of room .
Tom is no longer with the company .
I thought Tom loved Mary .
Tom said Mary wasn &apos;t looking for a job .
We didn &apos;t see anybody .
He kissed her .
Tom felt happy .
I knew Tom didn &apos;t do that .
You are completely right .
Do you know who said that ?
Take a look at that .
Tom has something else on his mind .
I &apos;m not hungry anymore .
I know the problem .
He came close to losing an eye .
I don &apos;t think that that &apos;s quite true .
She went for a walk .
We should let him know .
I &apos;m tired .
You have to listen to Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom killed anybody .
I got tired of waiting for Tom .
Tom thinks Mary made the right choice .
We &apos;re a family .
I &apos;d like to do what you do .
I saw that one coming .
I &apos;ll tell Tom .
I &apos;ll give you a new one .
I would like to eat something .
We &apos;re closed tomorrow .
If I &apos;d known your telephone number , I would &apos;ve called you .
She looks young , but as a matter of fact she is older than you are .
I hate them .
We &apos;ve got a problem .
I think I &apos;ve done well .
I would never say such a thing .
Tom had nothing left to drink .
Tom bought a camera for Mary .
You can &apos;t help now . It &apos;s too late .
Tom came yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to think .
He arrived in time for the meeting .
Tom came back inside the room .
Will you help us ?
I understood almost nothing .
Tom told Mary not to be afraid .
Just do what I say .
Don &apos;t say that word .
Why don &apos;t you help us ?
I bought a hat .
Tom held up his hands .
There must be an explanation .
They know we &apos;re here .
How was your night ?
Mary became worried after she read Tom &apos;s letter .
I still don &apos;t like to driving the city .
I walk to school .
Mary is like a sister to me .
I &apos;d really like to help .
He raised his hand .
The tea is hot .
You can &apos;t leave us , Tom .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
It &apos;s time to go .
I wish you hadn &apos;t told that story to my mother .
We &apos;re doing what we want to do .
What &apos;s Tom good at ?
Tom can &apos;t forget Mary .
Where is my watch ?
Tom was waiting to see what would happen .
Are you for or against my plan ?
Tom tried to talk to us in French .
He has to fix the clock .
Turn it off .
I found him a job .
You knew about this already , didn &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s good news to me .
What is it you want to sell to us ?
I know you &apos;re not serious .
How did you learn French ?
She needs our help .
I think this is good .
This is not for you .
He has been driving for hours .
I told you not to tell anyone .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
I would like to kiss you .
She lost her money , her family and her friends .
We won &apos;t be here much longer .
Is it hard to speak English ?
The boy I helped is Tom .
I &apos;ll go to school .
What are you and Tom up to ?
Tom gets home at 2 : 30 almost every day .
I , too , am a teacher .
Whose idea was this ?
Tom says he wasn &apos;t here yesterday . It must &apos;ve been someone else you saw .
Did you hear about what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
I stayed in Boston for three days .
I have to stay home .
I wish I had been there with you .
I guess I &apos;m not as smart as you .
Tom has been good to me .
Tom is a little older than me .
I believe you .
We all knew it .
I know where to go .
Tom takes himself too seriously .
You &apos;re never satisfied .
He lived there all by himself .
There has to be another way to do this .
Tom didn &apos;t want to lose .
What are you trying to say ?
I also like to listen to music .
I loved it in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t say where he had been .
If only I had asked for your advice .
You &apos;ve already told me this story .
Tom slept on the train .
I think you &apos;ve got what I need .
I hope we &apos;ll see each other again soon .
I think Tom wants more .
I &apos;ve never really been close to anyone .
Tom wasn &apos;t alone .
Have you heard about the accident ?
I love you more and more each day .
What would you have done in Tom &apos;s place ?
He is in college .
Tom showed Mary John &apos;s picture .
She doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom has been absent from school for three days .
Tom may one day be the boss .
Tom may eat whatever he wants to .
That &apos;s not their fault .
I wanted to do that last week , but didn &apos;t have the time .
They have a large house .
He looks like his grandfather .
I don &apos;t have any brothers .
We have a lot more to talk about .
Everyone calls him Tom .
I saw Tom at the library .
You &apos;re not Canadian .
I &apos;m alone with Tom .
This is our house .
Tom told me I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
He is not my father but my uncle .
No one has ever said such things to me .
I &apos;ve got to do something about it .
I kept asking myself why I &apos;m doing this .
I knew you &apos;d make it .
Tom is one of my students .
Tom isn &apos;t waiting anymore .
Tom is one of the three guys who couldn &apos;t do that .
Tom , you &apos;ve got to talk to Mary .
Tom decided to sell one of his cars to Mary .
We had a lot of fun together .
I went to sleep about 10 o &apos;clock .
I &apos;d better be on my way .
Tom &apos;s impressed .
It &apos;s still not working .
Tom &apos;s lonely .
That &apos;s the way he likes it .
Tom hit a dog yesterday .
Tom began to cry .
I bought a book about animals .
How are you going to help Tom ?
You can do that tomorrow .
We have nothing else to eat .
I have often heard him say that .
You look fine , Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary should do that .
I didn &apos;t know for certain which train to take .
It &apos;s cold out there .
You missed a lot .
I know you like me .
This makes me happy .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom know that ?
I &apos;m going to bed early today .
Tom is writing a book about his father .
My sister is older than my brother .
Could you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
I got a letter from a friend of mine in London .
Tom is telling the truth .
What does that have to do with Tom ?
Tom and Mary both want to study French .
What &apos;s the difference between these two ?
We don &apos;t know how to use them .
Is Tom well ?
He is a man of his word .
Tom wasn &apos;t sick .
They &apos;re children .
Tom said he &apos;s very happy .
&quot; I &apos;m not in love with Tom anymore . &quot; &quot; Are you sure ? &quot;
I can &apos;t figure out what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
He lost sight of the bird .
Tom helped Mary with her homework .
I thought I told you to handle this yourself .
He is likely to win this game .
How about calling it a day ?
I think that &apos;s impossible in Tom &apos;s case .
I &apos;d like to ask you a couple of questions .
He refused to pay .
Were you at the library yesterday afternoon ?
I know that Tom likes Mary .
Tom said that he &apos;d call tomorrow .
I got angry .
How was school today ?
I forgot her completely .
Tom was careful .
Have you received an answer to your letter ?
He cannot have been there yesterday .
We &apos;re always right .
I know you &apos;re in there .
She &apos;ll lend you a book .
I can &apos;t remember how I got home last night .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home now .
You ought to know better .
I &apos;d like a car like yours .
I &apos;ve never been late before .
Everyone likes pizza .
Tom isn &apos;t going with you , is he ?
I think Tom knows what he &apos;s doing .
I don &apos;t speak a word of French .
Tom wasn &apos;t willing to do what Mary asked him to do .
Tom never had to study very much .
They got along very well .
I never thought I &apos;d see him there .
I &apos;d be willing to pay you .
Tom had nothing left to eat .
We weren &apos;t invited to the party .
I know how to fly .
Your dog is very fat .
I stood up slowly .
Tom seems to like studying French .
Tom drove me home .
You &apos;d better not tell Tom .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t being paid enough .
I wish I knew the answer to this question .
You have a car , don &apos;t you ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think so .
Tom went to church with Mary .
She has a few friends .
I don &apos;t want to play .
We &apos;re at home today .
Will she be able to leave the hospital next week ?
That would be difficult .
The concert is over .
How did it go ?
You didn &apos;t get very far .
I &apos;ve been told I should do that again .
I can &apos;t stand this noise any longer .
I wasn &apos;t nervous .
Tom still doesn &apos;t know what Mary is supposed to do .
My time is running out .
Let &apos;s see what &apos;s on TV .
He ran away with the money .
Do your children speak French ?
Mary has beautiful eyes .
This is the man I told you about .
Tom should probably spend more time with Mary .
I &apos;m happy doing what I do .
I think I &apos;ll walk back .
Let &apos;s not talk about that now .
Where &apos;re Tom &apos;s things ?
His family didn &apos;t have much money .
I &apos;m free today .
I barely know you .
When she entered the room , he stood up .
Tom wants to finish doing what he &apos;s doing .
What did I do wrong ?
Can I ask you a favor ?
I want you to meet my friend , Tom .
I &apos;m disappointed with you .
I want Tom to go .
I &apos;m not you .
Tom &apos;s not asleep .
We haven &apos;t come to a decision yet .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s in love with John .
Tom seemed very surprised .
You know what you must do .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that in a couple of days .
There &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
When are we going to use it ?
What did she say ?
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends .
When do I get to go home ?
It doesn &apos;t matter .
We got married .
I had no choice but to take the plane .
When I &apos;m with you , I &apos;m happy .
Tell them not to leave without me .
I came with Tom .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go to bed .
What &apos;s your opinion ?
Tom looks like someone who &apos;s used to being alone .
Please eat some cake .
Don &apos;t you want these ?
Tom didn &apos;t go to school yesterday .
I hope that you will get well soon .
It will soon be dark .
Why did Tom give you that ?
I didn &apos;t know where to look .
Tom has just arrived .
Tom sometimes wears a hat .
Tom isn &apos;t the only one here who knows French .
How do you know ?
She lives just across from us .
I want to learn Japanese .
I bet Tom doesn &apos;t have any plans .
Get him to help you with the work .
Tom is hiding .
Tom is fast , isn &apos;t he ?
I just didn &apos;t know what to do .
I know someone who speaks French well .
She has many friends .
We are all excited about the concert .
He almost died .
I thought I could count on you .
I don &apos;t like being home alone .
Tom told me to meet him at his apartment .
Please turn on the TV .
You are tall , but he is still taller .
Tom showed the letter to me .
Don &apos;t forget our date tomorrow .
Be sure and call me tonight .
I am proud to work with you .
I just don &apos;t believe that .
I think I did something wrong .
A child could not have understood the situation .
I can &apos;t eat meat .
I don &apos;t care what others think .
I saw somebody .
I don &apos;t speak French well .
I am coming .
Tom seems to know the secret .
Can I sleep on the couch ?
He wouldn &apos;t listen to my advice .
We love coffee .
We may never know .
I couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
Tom was wearing a new hat .
Tom is one of my best friends .
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom ?
I &apos;d like a table by the window .
It &apos;s work .
Tom wondered what Mary would say to John .
I don &apos;t think Tom is able to do that anymore .
Tom was so careful .
I asked Tom where he had gone to school .
How long is that going to take ?
Is this dog Tom &apos;s ?
Tom is probably hungry .
Maybe Tom went shopping with Mary .
Everything is all right .
The keys were in my bag .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t gotten married so young .
Tom did that just a month ago .
Her name wasn &apos;t on the list .
Are you our enemy ?
What they told you is not true .
I heard a young girl call for help .
No one is home .
Tom is on the plane .
This is your chance , Tom .
I still don &apos;t know yet .
My uncle died a year ago .
What would you like for breakfast ?
I need someone to talk with .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
Tom wanted to learn how to swim .
I tried really hard .
What else does Tom need ?
Tom still can &apos;t understand French .
We should do this every day .
I think we &apos;d better go .
I watched baseball on TV after I finished my homework .
I &apos;m going to see Mary this afternoon .
I don &apos;t need your help .
Tom is missing a few teeth .
Tom has no interest in golf .
I &apos;ll call for you at eight tomorrow morning .
I forget his name .
They &apos;re not going to stop you .
Tom is writing to a friend .
Can Tom see us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary to go to Boston with him .
I must remember to see her .
You can say what you like .
My work is very important .
There is no sugar here .
When &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
I wish you were here with me .
You might have an accident .
It sure is cold today .
Tom knows Mary isn &apos;t here .
How dangerous is the situation ?
How many people know about this ?
Tom , I &apos;d like you to meet someone .
Tom is paid to do that , isn &apos;t he ?
We need them .
He seemed to have been rich .
I don &apos;t see what good that &apos;ll do .
She is good at swimming .
Nobody wants to be around Tom .
Tom liked living in Australia .
You can &apos;t have left it at the airport .
Tell me again what Tom and I are supposed to do .
I was very happy .
I do not read books .
You think I don &apos;t know who you are , don &apos;t you ?
I know her very well .
We &apos;re not going with you .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s quite true .
I have a favor to ask of you .
Why is Tom sleeping ?
I thought Tom was Canadian .
This is as far as I go .
I didn &apos;t know we weren &apos;t supposed to do that .
It &apos;s you that she loves , not me .
After you leave , I &apos;ll be lonely .
Give me some advice .
I was ready .
Tom is my mother &apos;s brother .
It &apos;s a welcome change .
Tom and Mary have only been married three weeks .
I don &apos;t know where they hid the key .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the truth yet .
Tom wants to know who Mary &apos;s boyfriend is .
I found the book easy .
I was expecting it !
Tom won &apos;t eat that .
I &apos;m really looking forward to Tom &apos;s visit .
Tom is coming for dinner .
Everything makes sense now .
How long do we have to wait ?
Where have you been all evening ?
I know what &apos;s in the box .
Please shut the door behind you .
Tom was finished doing that by 2 : 30 .
I know where you &apos;re going .
We can &apos;t go back there .
I &apos;ve been working on this for just for a couple of days .
I need money .
No one ever came to see me in the hospital .
You know where to find me if you want to talk .
He showed me around .
Tom speaks a little French .
He arrived at the station .
Many people are upset .
Did you bring it ?
I want more milk .
What exactly has Tom done ?
Tom wants to see Mary .
We have run short of food .
I wish my dream would come true .
Tom was disappointed .
Have you made up your mind yet ?
It doesn &apos;t sound too hard .
It is likely to rain tomorrow .
I was late for work this morning .
Keep reading .
He started his day with a good breakfast .
I &apos;ll take care of the dog while you are out .
I thought you didn &apos;t want to talk about this now .
Tom married Mary last year .
Tom asked a very good question .
She is proud of her son .
You know Tom has a thing for you .
It was a little fun .
I think everybody is ready .
They are happy .
He probably won &apos;t come .
What else do you need to do today ?
I have money for you .
She has the large house to herself .
They &apos;re going to Boston .
I &apos;ll have to do that .
What &apos;s it made of ?
It is not more than ten minutes &apos; walk from here .
Tom is younger than your daughter .
Can you translate this for me ?
I &apos;ve been doing this for thirty years .
Is this car yours ?
May I have something to drink ?
I would like to help you .
I only need one hundred dollars .
He drives a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
Tom was kind enough to tell me the truth .
It is very expensive .
It &apos;s more than a hundred years old .
I have to find Tom .
They don &apos;t want us to know .
No one knows where we are .
I &apos;m speaking .
Give it a rest .
Tom stopped .
You don &apos;t speak French by any chance , do you ?
I went to school with Tom .
My friends didn &apos;t do that .
I &apos;m dying .
I got tired very fast .
We &apos;re going to watch the game together .
I &apos;d like to know why .
That helped .
Why is your French so good ?
Don &apos;t talk to me about Tom .
The doctor said that Tom didn &apos;t need to stay in the hospital .
I can &apos;t fly .
We &apos;ll meet Tom .
I had a good opinion of her .
Where &apos;s my cup ?
I wish that you were here with me .
How do you get to work ?
Your suitcase is too heavy .
I like walking at night .
Tom spent his birthday in the hospital .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend anymore .
Tom has never had much money .
I hate this .
I haven &apos;t asked anyone yet .
Not every child likes apples .
Did you help Tom ?
I want to go to Australia with my family .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like me .
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as I am .
Tom didn &apos;t know we were supposed to do that this morning .
Who do you want to speak to ?
Where will you stay when you go to Boston ?
Everybody was tired .
Is this the best you can do ?
She has an uncle who works in a bank .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what he heard .
Tom knows how to play the piano .
Call your brother .
Didn &apos;t your parents give you anything ?
I cannot understand what you say .
I think everybody &apos;s here .
Tom found Mary , didn &apos;t he ?
That &apos;s one explanation .
It &apos;s not like I don &apos;t want to do it .
Maybe it will be exactly the same for him .
Tom wants to know when Mary will go shopping .
Will you do it for me ?
Do you have my money ?
I &apos;ve got to go back to Boston tomorrow .
Tom closed the book .
Why do people do things like that ?
Do you think we &apos;ll ever find a way to do that ?
I knew you &apos;d say that .
What &apos;s her name ?
Tom says he &apos;s Canadian .
Tom turned up three hours late .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
Tom is lucky to be alive .
I have nothing to tell you at this moment .
This river is three times longer than that one .
May I sit here ?
Tom asked Mary to tell him where she &apos;d been .
He lives up there , up on that mountain .
Will you have another cup of tea ?
I didn &apos;t know whether to stay here or go to London .
Tom has never done anything like this before .
I &apos;ve told you the truth .
It was not at all funny .
Tom says he &apos;ll do that .
I was having dinner with Tom .
Tom drinks a lot of milk .
How much is this dress ?
Tom has asked us not to do that .
I &apos;m reading the newspaper .
Is there any beer left ?
You &apos;re a little too young for me .
I don &apos;t want to show it to Tom yet .
That &apos;s not important .
She asked him to open the window .
We &apos;re just trying to help you .
Tom knows a lot of people .
Tom has a nice camera .
You &apos;re too small .
Did you break up with Tom or did he break up with you ?
Please let me try it again .
She could not believe what she saw .
Look at that picture .
I &apos;m still young .
You should have done it earlier . It cannot be helped now .
I knew that Tom knew Mary .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell me ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I &apos;m awake .
I really enjoyed this book .
I want more money .
There is more .
Tell him where he should go .
Tom looks serious .
What time do you arrive tomorrow ?
The man lost all hope .
It is difficult , if not impossible , to solve this problem .
He put the book on the desk .
I &apos;m not your son .
It was quite funny .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be too worried .
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help .
He was very poor .
Tom is still looking .
I was at Tom &apos;s house . Where were you ?
She is working night and day .
Tom is pretty much finished .
Would you like to eat something else ?
Did you do what I asked you to do ?
No one else knows it .
If you need help , all you have to do is call .
You are here because we need your help .
Let &apos;s help Tom .
I came to tell you that you don &apos;t need to worry .
How did you know my name ?
Don &apos;t make fun of others .
I already know who you are .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll win .
You weren &apos;t even there .
Tom is off doing his own thing .
I don &apos;t like your friends at all .
She gave me a present .
I know Tom loves me .
I &apos;ll give that to Tom .
Tom plays tennis three times a week .
Tom already did that .
It &apos;s not as hot today as it was yesterday .
Where &apos;s Tom going with Mary ?
Tom is working on a new novel .
She will come if you ask her .
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d seen John with Alice .
Did you know this ?
I never thought it would happen to me .
Is this what you want ?
You &apos;ll have to kiss Tom .
He seldom , if ever , goes to the movies .
I said I saw Tom .
How did you get this idea ?
Nobody came to the party .
They &apos;re afraid of him .
Tom was scared .
Tom got drunk .
I sometimes play tennis with her .
The boy takes after his father .
These fish are the same color .
What do you think about this plan ?
Please come into the light so that I can see you better .
I asked Tom why he wasn &apos;t happy .
Who is better at French , Tom or Mary ?
All I want to do is sit here .
I have to work .
I &apos;d like to go .
What are your plans for Christmas ?
Tom and Mary will know what to do .
Why haven &apos;t you told your parents about us ?
His bike is better than mine .
Tom knows what it &apos;s about .
We &apos;ll miss you when you &apos;re gone .
Did you see it ?
May I have a piece of it ?
I love the idea .
Why did they just leave ?
You can sit down if you like .
I don &apos;t go to the movies as often as I used to .
Tom thought that Mary wouldn &apos;t like John .
That book is mine .
Tom knows a man who lives in Boston .
I met your parents yesterday .
They need new shoes .
People like to talk to you .
He had no chance to visit us .
Do whatever makes you happy .
She advised him not to do that .
Not all of us can speak English .
She has a great interest in music .
That computer doesn &apos;t work anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem so well .
It &apos;s your fault , not mine .
The plan hasn &apos;t changed .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You and I are going to have a lot of fun .
I may be too old .
Tom can speak French as well .
What Tom did was crazy .
Tom &apos;s happy .
I had to help Tom do that .
She is working on the problem .
We have everything we want .
How is the weather in Boston ?
Tom hasn &apos;t read this book yet .
I was at the party .
Isn &apos;t that what we were supposed to do ?
We need your help .
Tom has decided to help us .
Tom had to do it .
Tom ran back into the house .
He is as busy as ever .
No one will know .
The movie &apos;s about to start .
Tom was lucky .
I can &apos;t answer that question now .
I &apos;m going because I want to .
This is how I met your mother .
He doesn &apos;t have any friends .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
I feel well .
Tom never knew his parents .
Tom needs a good lawyer .
I need to see you immediately .
He got very mad .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak much .
I should tell Tom everything .
When did you get out of jail ?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday .
It &apos;s a nice day .
Tom thought of a good solution .
That &apos;s the same story as I heard when I was a child .
Tom can dance well .
Tom is just a little shy .
It all makes sense .
Just where do you think you &apos;re going ?
You had better not make a noise here .
Mary brought her daughter to work .
You taught me a lot .
My suitcase is broken .
I thought Mary loved me .
I just asked myself that same question .
I think we &apos;ll go with you .
I don &apos;t speak French as often as I used to .
I eat fruit .
Do you want wine ?
Why is Tom there ?
He wrote me from Japan .
Tom knew it was wrong to do what he did .
Everybody probably thinks I &apos;m crazy .
Your mother would be proud of you .
Please come .
I want a word with you .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
I &apos;d like to know more about Tom .
My car is faster than yours .
Please look up this word in a dictionary .
There appears to have been an accident .
Tom couldn &apos;t say anything else .
I have a problem .
We are sorry about the bad weather .
If anyone comes to see me , say that I went out .
He was kind enough to help me .
Is this the right way to the station ?
Are you free this evening ?
I don &apos;t have time to be sick .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d remember me .
Do you want me to go away ?
I like you .
I wonder why Tom killed himself .
Mary looks pretty in that dress .
I met Tom tonight .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t coming .
My parents are in Australia .
What was the weather yesterday ?
I &apos;m sure Tom loves you .
I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;ll be able to attend tomorrow &apos;s meeting .
She quit smoking .
I can &apos;t find Tom . He hasn &apos;t already gone and left , has he ?
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
Tom got into his car and drove off .
It &apos;s difficult .
Is it time ?
What are they doing out there ?
I &apos;m not a bit tired .
We are hungry .
Tom went too far .
I have no explanation .
Tom entered the room and closed the door .
How old is this church ?
Tom looked at his dog and his dog looked at him .
My parents are old .
We &apos;re not alone .
He said that I must go there .
What did you do with them ?
You &apos;re a big boy .
He kept quite calm .
Come on in !
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
What happened out there ?
Tom doesn &apos;t believe that &apos;s true .
My father does play golf , but not well .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m looking for .
Can you please stop singing ?
Tom didn &apos;t like the new plan .
He &apos;s always on time .
The man couldn &apos;t so much as write his own name .
Can it wait ?
He was very good at playing tennis .
Tom wants to know when you &apos;re coming home .
That was somebody else &apos;s idea .
The first few years were difficult .
No one will change anything .
Are you disappointed ?
Who knows that ?
Tom said that he had been hungry .
There is a lot of money .
Tom looked for the key .
The light was on .
There is always a next time .
I really don &apos;t understand this problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything yet .
I &apos;d love to visit Boston .
I don &apos;t want to go outside .
I want to go abroad .
That &apos;s a promise .
Tom asked Mary to give a speech at his school .
Tom would like to study French .
Do you have a dictionary ?
Your friend left town .
I &apos;m very lonely .
I want you to know that I &apos;ll always love you .
It &apos;s true that he is in love with her .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;s coming .
It wasn &apos;t that expensive .
Tom said something , but I couldn &apos;t hear what he said .
I must do better next time .
No one believes me .
They looked very happy .
My guess is that it will rain soon .
What did Tom really mean ?
I know both of them .
I &apos;m going to have to go home early today .
Tom is coming with us .
How long did you work for Tom ?
You &apos;ll want to see this .
Are you here alone ?
I went to bed early because I was tired .
Is this your first time here ?
You aren &apos;t from around here , are you ?
You must not stay here .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
My phone is about to die .
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk .
You don &apos;t think you can win , do you ?
She doesn &apos;t want to go to church .
We can &apos;t afford to make mistakes .
Maybe we should ask someone for help .
Tom seems afraid .
This is the best ship I &apos;ve ever been on .
Do you agree with this ?
She herself helped him .
I want to be sure Tom is happy .
We don &apos;t really have to talk about this right now , do we ?
He talks as if he knew everything .
That &apos;s what I would &apos;ve done .
He seems to know us .
It &apos;s not like you think .
Have you read this book yet ?
Maybe Tom will sell you his guitar .
English is spoken in America .
Let me know if you are in need of anything .
Tom will explain later .
I didn &apos;t really want to do that .
Tom and I got married three months ago .
That &apos;s what my friends keep telling me .
Don &apos;t keep saying you &apos;re sorry .
What do you think I should write ?
We ended up going home early .
It wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
I thought it was a secret .
You are exactly like your mother .
What &apos;re you watching ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to see me .
Who &apos;s up for some ice cream ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand .
Who gave Tom all that money ?
Are you ready , Tom ?
The teacher sat on the chair .
I want you to go there .
I wish I had eaten more .
Those dogs are big .
This car is easy to handle .
You &apos;re my enemy .
Tom asked Mary who her father was .
That &apos;s a bad name for a ship .
I &apos;d appreciate your help .
She &apos;s Tom &apos;s sister .
How do I get one of those ?
We regret doing that .
Tom did his homework and then went to bed .
I can &apos;t wait to hear your voice , Tom .
Tom asked Mary to wait for him in front of the library .
My husband is a doctor .
I just finished breakfast .
I don &apos;t know Tom , but I know his sister .
I &apos;ll get Tom to do that for us .
We only have one day left .
How long has he lived in London ?
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying .
Does Tom have to do that ?
How did you do it ?
Why don &apos;t you go alone ?
There is no other choice .
If you &apos;re not careful , you &apos;ll make a mistake again .
I was invited to dinner .
I remember the first time .
There was only one left .
I must get some sleep .
Call me .
What kind of book did you buy ?
Tom never wrote Mary back .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about that .
Tom put the book on the table .
He &apos;s a good person .
Tom has the day off .
It is more than I can stand .
Tom didn &apos;t get paid for it .
Tom will be here for three more weeks .
Tom is not who you think he is .
Tom had no say in the matter .
Please tell me the reason why she got angry .
Tom is just about as old as I am .
Tom isn &apos;t sure when Mary will get here .
What we need is a little more time .
I don &apos;t mean you .
I &apos;m not the least bit worried about losing my job .
I don &apos;t want to be different .
We &apos;re still in Boston .
Tom wants to go out with Mary .
Tom , I want to stay with you .
What were you doing then ?
Tom &apos;s shoes are under his bed .
I have to go inside and do my homework .
What &apos;s the matter , Tom ?
The girls were not afraid , but the boys were .
Tom can &apos;t get in touch with Mary .
I thought I knew him , but I didn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
Something &apos;s wrong here .
That woman &apos;s name is Mary .
There is little , if any , hope of his being alive .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary told John .
Is it true that Tom can &apos;t swim ?
I &apos;ll have to meet you there .
My car is three years older than yours .
I was still living in Australia at that time .
They &apos;re drunk .
If that wasn &apos;t Tom , who was it ?
You &apos;re tired , aren &apos;t you ? Why don &apos;t you get to bed ?
If that &apos;s what Tom said , then he was lying .
Why would anyone do such a thing ?
I didn &apos;t think Tom &apos;s jokes were funny .
What &apos;s Tom doing out there ?
I &apos;ve got a job and I don &apos;t want to lose it .
He bought a new pair of shoes .
You know I &apos;m telling the truth .
Tom and Mary want you there , too .
Are you ready ?
I don &apos;t know who wrote this letter .
I &apos;d like to go but I just don &apos;t have the time .
He took his time .
I haven &apos;t heard that name in years .
Tom has to leave in a few minutes .
This is where I work .
Aren &apos;t you from here ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to eat after all .
Does Tom have any family ?
You know how serious things are , don &apos;t you ?
How &apos;s life in Germany ?
I &apos;d rather not ask Tom to do that .
I don &apos;t feel like watching TV .
Please let me speak first .
He is going to the concert .
Will you be doing that again ?
I like school .
I would like some more water .
My wife &apos;s trying to sleep .
What &apos;re you up to today ?
Do you want this shirt ?
Where is your friend from ?
Tom is coming here .
You &apos;ve never told me your name .
My uncle has lived in Paris for ten years .
Get out of bed !
Nobody came to help me .
Tom likes French and he &apos;s good at it .
Tom can &apos;t afford to send his children to college .
He wondered why she did not come .
Mary eats less than her sister does .
He brought his lunch today .
I just had to ask Tom that question .
Why are you alone ?
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
Where do they want to go ?
Can I have a cup of coffee first ?
We &apos;ll go to the beach if it &apos;s nice tomorrow .
When will you have the report ready ?
He is said to be rich .
You ought to know that .
You should &apos;ve seen the movie .
Tom doesn &apos;t want any pizza .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
We &apos;ll have to do this later .
Who gave you this watch ?
I &apos;ll get her to come here .
Do you think Tom stole that ?
Tom said that he wanted to go to Boston .
Tom is waiting for someone .
I was very tired .
Did Tom try ?
What type of person are you ?
Did you bring the book ?
This is interesting .
He was in France .
Tom is three years younger than I am .
It seems that no one knew the truth .
It &apos;s getting dark . You &apos;d better go home .
Can you teach me how to play golf ?
Take it .
Tom showed me around .
We see each other once a month .
Do you happen to have the time ?
Tom rarely gets angry .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you today .
Tom isn &apos;t at home now .
It &apos;s been ten years since we last met .
Tom played with his kids .
Tom made me go .
It &apos;s getting hot here in Boston .
I &apos;ll call you every night .
We &apos;re sorry , too .
You are as tall as I am .
I didn &apos;t tell anyone .
Tom stopped laughing .
How do you like my new suit ?
Do you want my opinion ?
Don &apos;t let anybody see you .
They won .
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do .
I want a lot .
A trip to America this summer is out of the question .
Why didn &apos;t you just kiss Tom ?
We &apos;re not leaving without you .
I &apos;m not a little girl anymore .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done any better .
My father is busy just now .
I need to get back to work .
Tom and Mary are friends .
I can &apos;t play piano .
I only have six months to live .
I can &apos;t help you with this .
He can run faster than me .
Tom was there for three hours .
Why should Tom be any different ?
I wasn &apos;t the one who wrote this .
To be honest , I don &apos;t know .
This is what I want .
He didn &apos;t say a word to me all day .
What are they drinking ?
I want to see you again .
I started to cry .
You look better in this dress .
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me .
Tom got up early this morning .
Tom and John are brothers .
This seems too good to be true .
How did you come to know her ?
I &apos;ve written three letters .
They didn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone in the room .
I wish I could go to the party with you .
I guess that &apos;s all I need .
Did Tom enjoy it ?
Who did you learn it from ?
I &apos;m tired of writing .
I think Tom stole my bicycle .
There &apos;s no other choice .
Tom won &apos;t have to wait very long .
Who is this lady ?
I think Tom is very smart .
Tom is out to get you .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me what I want to know .
That can wait until later .
Tom was drunk and angry .
I will go if you go .
Stop talking about Tom .
Can you do this problem ?
Tom works for Mary &apos;s father .
I don &apos;t know for certain when he will arrive .
Tom made that mistake on purpose .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than Mary .
Nobody knows the truth .
He has to come .
He is my brother , not my father .
You &apos;re not alone , Tom .
I don &apos;t want to see anybody get hurt .
I &apos;m thinking about you .
What &apos;s it worth to you ?
I want everyone to help me clean the house .
You &apos;re quite right .
Is that Tom &apos;s car ?
I &apos;ve never seen you like this before .
Tom wondered what he was supposed to do .
Tom could have helped me , but he didn &apos;t .
Tom said he was ready to talk .
Tom quit .
He speaks five languages .
I made that for you .
Tom is going to be here .
He has a test next week .
Maybe we should blame Tom for what we did .
I don &apos;t think she is happy .
Tom came close .
They &apos;re in here .
Tom couldn &apos;t decide where to go .
I met her at the church .
The woman is fat .
I can &apos;t live like this anymore .
Is that your mom ?
I &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
Are there any questions ?
I know what he did .
You like Tom , don &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t let them win .
Do I have to study ?
Tom isn &apos;t seeing Mary .
I speak French almost every day .
Tom and I are brothers .
My wife really hates cats .
There isn &apos;t anyone here but us .
I &apos;m happy where I am .
What do you have here ?
She came out of there .
Tom told me his secret .
I love living in Australia .
What &apos;s that got to do with you ?
I think Tom knows why I &apos;m here .
Japan is a beautiful country .
We can still get there on time .
I don &apos;t miss Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s sorry .
Tom didn &apos;t go home last night .
That &apos;s our problem .
Where are you planning on going this evening ?
I like my school .
My brother has been living in London for many years .
What &apos;s the matter with Tom ?
How do you want to do this ?
Tom and Mary both want to know what happened .
Tom is the one who told me how to do it .
This is my friend .
We have to be very careful .
I don &apos;t get what you mean .
They have lived here for ten years .
I don &apos;t like that word .
Tom isn &apos;t as strong as before .
I had to go there alone .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that kind of thing anymore .
It &apos;s way too heavy .
She often goes to the movies with him .
Leave us .
I have everything I need .
Tom said that he &apos;ll look after me .
She is wearing a hat .
I &apos;d do it if I could .
Is there anything else you would like to eat ?
Tom didn &apos;t know when Mary &apos;s birthday was .
I didn &apos;t believe them .
When are you going to work ?
I knew it was too late .
This one &apos;s great .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about Australia .
What time did you arrive there ?
Take all the time you need .
We should get going .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom has already forgotten what I told him yesterday .
I &apos;m up .
This is where I usually eat lunch .
Are your parents in now ?
I want that .
My bag is very heavy .
She looked at the picture .
Is Tom good at cooking ?
She refused to accept the money .
Tom will call you later .
Let me see how I feel tomorrow .
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather .
Tom isn &apos;t our enemy .
Tom told everyone he was afraid to do that .
You &apos;re a good deal older than Tom .
How do I get to the beach ?
Everyone loves their father .
We have very little time .
My father got me to wash the car .
What is there to understand ?
I don &apos;t like this weather .
Who gave this to you ?
Call your sisters .
Don &apos;t go too far away .
How &apos;s your sister ?
It &apos;s my birthday soon .
I might &apos;ve forgotten my keys .
I don &apos;t remember my father anymore .
I don &apos;t think Tom has ever studied French .
Tom has no idea what has become of Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about it .
You can &apos;t believe a word of it .
Tom would never do something like that .
My room is very small .
Tom can &apos;t cook very well .
This happens to me all the time .
Tom is very angry .
What time is it by your watch ?
Tom usually eats his lunch alone .
I should &apos;ve talked to Tom first .
I wanted to talk about it .
I bought a watch and I lost it the next day .
Who &apos;ll cook ?
Tom and I are pretty good friends .
It is necessary for you to go there .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s really going on .
I asked her if she knew his address .
They won &apos;t have arrived yet .
It doesn &apos;t surprise me .
I am the same age .
It &apos;s no use going there .
You &apos;re not Canadian , are you ?
I &apos;m not sure of anything .
Tom knows we know it .
Don &apos;t you know how ?
Tom is in a good mood .
I need new shoes .
I like speaking in French .
The street is empty .
The glass is clean .
I &apos;ll do as you say .
This work has to be finished by Monday .
Did you remember to thank Tom ?
It looks very good .
We should do this every Monday .
I just met her on the street .
There were a lot of people at the party .
Tom invited me over to watch a movie .
We can finish it later .
Tom and I are very busy .
We &apos;ve forgotten something .
I didn &apos;t speak for long .
I gave that to Tom .
Tom sometimes makes dinner for us .
You go first .
I thought she was cute .
Tom is almost always correct .
You can &apos;t speak French , can you ?
I enjoy music .
It &apos;s very cold here .
I &apos;ve asked everybody .
That has nothing to do with me .
You &apos;re like a brother to me .
I told Tom what Mary did .
It won &apos;t be long before your dream comes true .
We &apos;re impressed .
They don &apos;t know about it .
We &apos;ll deal with it tomorrow .
Why can &apos;t we do it again ?
Tom wants you fired .
He worked long into the night .
She &apos;s eating an apple .
I played with Tom and Mary today .
How about tomorrow ?
We met them yesterday .
He likes animals more than people .
Tom told me to go buy some bread .
I think Tom was born in Australia .
Tom married Mary &apos;s sister and Mary married Tom &apos;s brother .
Here are their books .
I &apos;d like to work with Tom .
They aren &apos;t happy to see you .
I was happy to see Tom go .
The bus stopped , but nobody got off .
Everyone knows .
Let Tom live .
I know quite a few people who don &apos;t eat meat .
Everything went well with him .
I did not think that he would help us .
Tom worked until 2 : 30 .
How did you come to know this ?
Tom had no one to talk to .
I &apos;ve got to show you something .
We miss you very much .
I wish I had been with you then .
I &apos;ve lost my friends .
Get it out of here .
I &apos;ll explain it to you later on .
If only I &apos;d done my homework !
Can you show me on the map ?
It just makes no sense .
That must be my book .
There must be something else to drink .
Aren &apos;t you going to see Tom ?
I need a moment alone with Tom .
Tom talks a lot .
The little boy has lost the money given to him by his father .
Tom never came home .
I &apos;m really glad I did it .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go , I won &apos;t either .
You &apos;re the one who knows how to do this .
What are you going to be doing with that ?
They both got here late .
You know what Tom said , don &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t dance either .
Do you know why I gave it to you ?
That hat looks good on you .
Tom came just as I was leaving .
Can you find her ?
I &apos;m not able to translate this sentence .
We went to the beach .
That &apos;s kind of important .
If you don &apos;t believe me , go and see for yourself .
We &apos;ve already met .
We tried that yesterday .
Tom and Mary want John to stay for a few more hours .
I have children .
I would &apos;ve done anything .
You &apos;re not one of us .
Who do you think you are ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows that he has to do that today .
He didn &apos;t see a thing .
Why is Tom leaving school ?
I don &apos;t like Tom and Mary .
Were you a friend of Tom &apos;s ?
Tom could barely walk .
Do you know why she couldn &apos;t come ?
Where &apos;s my husband ?
She will have a child next month .
What &apos;re your plans for the weekend ?
That &apos;s not even funny .
Tom won &apos;t be here until 2 : 30 .
We may never know what happened to Tom .
I live alone .
What Tom wants to do isn &apos;t going to help .
There &apos;s nothing left to be done .
It is too expensive for me to buy .
I didn &apos;t read the story .
What do you know about this ?
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll find a way .
We &apos;re going to my brother &apos;s .
I don &apos;t like him either .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom yourself ?
Yesterday , I didn &apos;t say anything .
You told me that before .
Why didn &apos;t you call me earlier ?
I have to stop this .
I had already heard that song once .
Tom can &apos;t stop me .
I &apos;ll take back everything I said .
This book &apos;s new .
Tom wasn &apos;t too tired to study .
This is a picture of Tom and me when we were three years old .
Tom comes from a good family .
She fell in love with him .
It &apos;s for me .
Tom seemed scared .
Tom asked me what I needed .
Please don &apos;t tell Tom about what we did .
What was the problem ?
I &apos;d like you to meet my sister , Mary .
I know what I &apos;m doing .
I don &apos;t know why they &apos;re doing this .
No one has said a word .
Tom looked pretty tired .
This watch is expensive .
I always wanted to do that .
There is a piano in the room .
Tom still has a lot to learn .
If I can understand it , anyone can .
How do you think Tom knew that ?
I &apos;m going to bed .
Tom asked Mary where John was .
They are both good .
I feel well today .
Is there a doctor in the house ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to Boston .
The bill , please .
Tom realized he had no choice .
I &apos;m not sure I want Tom working for us .
Tom wanted this .
How do we explain this to the kids ?
How &apos;s the weather in Boston ?
You &apos;re too young to get married .
I &apos;ll be good to Tom .
Tom wasn &apos;t home .
He has a few friends .
We &apos;ll start .
I wonder what Tom thinks of me .
It doesn &apos;t mean what you think it means .
Tom took off his shoes .
No one had any questions about the plan .
The ball hit her in the eye .
I love my dog .
I am reading a play .
I &apos;ll be in Boston .
I hate myself .
That &apos;s not a nice thing to say .
What do you want to have for lunch ?
Can you still remember when we first met ?
They attend every meeting .
Tom won &apos;t be here much longer .
Tom is one of the three men that came here yesterday .
What was the weather like ?
We should go to the party together .
He didn &apos;t get her joke .
Look at this .
The air felt a little cold .
Tom gets it .
I was so happy back then .
What time did they leave ?
I love this picture .
I would rather not go .
We &apos;re going to miss doing this .
What time is the meeting ?
He is very sick .
Did Tom come ?
Look into my eyes .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t done that .
Tom wouldn &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t feel like doing anything right now .
I &apos;m thinking of you .
What do I have to lose ?
I don &apos;t understand what he said .
That &apos;s not such a terrible idea .
I was lonely without her .
You &apos;re a bit early , aren &apos;t you ?
All you have to do is tell Tom to leave .
You &apos;ve found something .
How come you &apos;re late ?
Tom pretended he was sick .
Tom is coming on Monday .
I &apos;m not certain , but I think so .
How long do I have to stay ?
Tom is waiting to speak to Mary .
Tom is rich .
You &apos;ve always loved Tom , haven &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not even Canadian .
You &apos;re not young anymore .
I &apos;ll say it again .
Please bear in mind what I said .
I liked this movie .
Tom knows you &apos;re here .
He seems to be rich .
Tom will be here .
That &apos;s a good question .
The baby was sleeping all day long .
I have a dream .
Tom died alone .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know Mary was able to speak French .
He played golf every day during his vacation .
Tom is back in Australia .
I spent most of the day in bed .
I don &apos;t know why Tom &apos;s doing that .
Why did you quit your job ?
I wouldn &apos;t have waited .
Is the door open ?
They want Tom .
I am not interested .
Tom loved animals .
What does he say in his letter ?
I wish I could see Tom again .
Tom made a few mistakes on the test .
I got home and took my shoes off .
Tom ran past Mary .
I &apos;ve never seen that kind of tree before .
You should be happy for me .
I can fly .
I can wait for you .
They didn &apos;t pay me .
He went to New York on Monday .
I can &apos;t carry this suitcase by myself .
Tom drank a cup of coffee .
What &apos;s Tom have to say about this ?
I &apos;m not very happy here .
My father takes a walk every day .
Tom is no longer in jail .
He lives there alone .
Has prison changed him ?
There were a lot of people in the room .
If I had had enough money , I would have bought that computer .
These are as good as those .
Why are you so late ?
Tom got very angry with Mary .
You will always be welcome .
I have everything .
Tom and John aren &apos;t brothers .
Tell Tom the truth .
I can &apos;t help how it sounds .
Tell me how that &apos;s possible .
We don &apos;t have time for this .
Tom told me he wanted to quit the company .
I speak French every day at work .
He is about your age .
This was a big mistake .
The doctor gave it to her .
You learn fast .
It can &apos;t be done .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom was really angry .
This dog runs fast .
When will we go home ?
Tom needs help .
Can you cook well ?
We should study together .
A guy named Tom was looking for you this morning .
I didn &apos;t want to do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary driving his car .
I like what I like .
You &apos;re lucky Tom didn &apos;t hit you .
How do you know this ?
Tom has never been abroad .
Someone gave me this .
Do you like Tom for a name ?
I &apos;m not going to answer any more questions .
It might be fun .
What do you have to do ?
I &apos;m almost finished .
I don &apos;t remember you asking me to do that .
Tom hasn &apos;t been here long .
You can leave the room now .
He drank a lot yesterday .
It was the best night of my life .
Today was a beautiful day .
Are you the only one who has a key to this door ?
There are many people that don &apos;t like me .
Was that all you saw ?
It &apos;s good seeing you .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want anything else ?
I heard you talking .
Tom disappointed Mary .
Was it cold ?
Could she be Tom &apos;s daughter ?
I was angry and confused .
The dictionary on the desk is mine .
Tom takes himself very seriously .
Where &apos;s my coat ?
I don &apos;t think I know you .
Will it snow tonight ?
Tom thought his leg was broken .
Tom needs that money .
Tom killed himself last night .
I &apos;ll take you home .
I know all their names .
This really happened .
I &apos;m drunk .
I let in the cat .
Tom left home at 2 : 30 .
I don &apos;t think that I &apos;ll be able to solve this problem by myself .
I want to do it for Tom .
Your name is Tom , correct ?
It &apos;s your turn to sing .
It &apos;s very cold this winter .
I love that chair .
Are you thinking about Tom ?
Tom &apos;s parents have a lot of money .
I can &apos;t talk about that right now .
I don &apos;t want to do that for Tom .
This is a beautiful country .
Everybody should have a purpose .
She wanted to be alone .
We &apos;ll soon find out .
I wonder what time it is .
He &apos;s not going to make it .
Tom got off the bus .
I have a table .
I &apos;ve known Tom for a long time .
That &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
You can &apos;t lose what you don &apos;t have .
Tom started to cry right away .
Let me help you choose .
May I ask how old you are ?
How far are you prepared to go ?
I &apos;ll come here again tomorrow .
What did you eat for dinner last night ?
Take your time .
I think I &apos;ll go visit Tom and see how he &apos;s doing .
She is no less beautiful than her sister .
I &apos;m coming , too .
How &apos;s your family ?
It was not until I read the book that I knew about it .
Tom comes home at around six .
They love it .
Tom says it &apos;s important for us to be there tomorrow .
The taxi I took was very old and small .
I didn &apos;t drink the milk .
You shouldn &apos;t let Tom drive .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
I &apos;m already ready .
Did you really talk to Tom ?
She is kind .
They &apos;re sisters .
You should wash your face .
Can you play the piano ?
He has a lot of money , but has almost no friends .
It &apos;s never been done before .
Is French difficult ?
I think Tom knows Mary .
Tom was surprised by what he saw .
When did you find out about it ?
Why do people say that ?
The way you &apos;re doing it is wrong .
Did you do it ?
Tom drank the whole bottle of wine all by himself .
I wish that we could spend more time together .
We &apos;re almost done .
I &apos;m sure Tom is just fine .
I &apos;m not going out .
Tom didn &apos;t know a thing about it .
What do they know ?
Tom wanted to turn himself in .
He quickly went out of the room .
I don &apos;t think he can help you .
I can &apos;t show you .
I don &apos;t care what you want .
I have hardly any money with me .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in 2 months .
I &apos;m used to waiting .
It &apos;s out of the question !
Tom is good at playing tennis .
You can &apos;t just not do your job .
Tom says I look like you .
Tom might want to go there with us .
Tom often plays guitar with Mary .
Do you want Tom to wait ?
I spoke to him yesterday .
When we saw what was happening there , we decided to leave .
Don &apos;t you know that ?
English is spoken all over the world .
I wrote some letters last night .
I &apos;ve never heard of him .
Tom should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
You didn &apos;t come here alone , did you ?
I was up all night studying .
I haven &apos;t been married long .
She was laughed at .
We were very hungry .
Let &apos;s wait here .
I &apos;m at the restaurant .
Tom knows the man Mary came with .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to be alone .
Tom knows what we did .
What does he plan to do ?
There are too many of them .
Tom stood there .
I can &apos;t lend this book to you .
There isn &apos;t anybody else .
I don &apos;t have a family yet .
Nobody had ever heard of it .
I &apos;ll never be late again .
This suit is too big for me .
Is he still here ?
Are you getting paid for this ?
I haven &apos;t finished reading this book .
Are you going to do that ?
What am I going to say ?
I &apos;ve been reading this for a few hours .
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden .
Tom &apos;ll know .
He helped me do my homework .
Do I have to go now ?
There are some things that money can &apos;t buy .
New York is a big city .
I am afraid of what the teacher will say .
He did what they told him .
I &apos;ll call you as soon as I &apos;ve finished .
I understood that .
She makes me happy .
It &apos;s not easy for me .
Did you watch the movie ?
He was born rich .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what happened .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink much .
That made me very sad .
I wonder what Tom is doing .
Tom seems to have no interest in baseball .
Maybe Tom will know what to do .
How many more days are there until Christmas ?
Tom had to stay in the hospital for a week .
What &apos;s that thing you have in your hand ?
Can you read ?
What did you do yesterday ?
That &apos;s what I wanted to ask .
How many years have you two been married ?
We &apos;re coming .
Why did this happen ?
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary is .
Was it an accident ?
I &apos;d like to hear what you have to say on this .
Did you leave the window open ?
I know what to say .
Tom hasn &apos;t told me what needs to be done .
Can you swim across the river ?
Tom left his umbrella in the classroom .
This is what happens when you don &apos;t pay attention to what you &apos;re doing .
We have to do it together .
Tom came to school very late today .
Tom and Mary both can &apos;t swim .
Do you want to become a father ?
I &apos;m surprised that Tom doesn &apos;t know how to speak French .
We did that just for fun .
I was the only one who didn &apos;t know .
What is he saying ?
It meant a lot to me .
I had to go to America .
I want to do what &apos;s best for both of us .
She likes nobody and nobody likes her .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary will come tomorrow .
Why did you tell this joke ?
I &apos;ll give Tom another chance .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but a teacher .
Can you explain your answer ?
Can &apos;t we just be friends ?
Has Tom spoken to you about me ?
She lives with him in a small apartment .
He was a tall man .
Tom told everybody that Mary knew how to do that .
The man took my arm .
She takes dinner to his house every evening .
I &apos;ll be back in two hours .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with Mary .
That &apos;s not an answer .
Do you have time to help me ?
I don &apos;t like tennis much .
I &apos;m going to go see Tom .
Tom and Mary have a son .
There is a reason that everybody hates Tom .
What makes you think I &apos;m rich ?
I think they saw you .
It was too late for us to do anything else .
You had no choice but to do it .
You &apos;ve made me very happy .
Tom never comes .
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday .
You need to answer the question .
That book &apos;s mine .
I &apos;ll cook for you tonight .
He was very kind to them .
Tom said that he was worried about his future .
Tom didn &apos;t want to dance with me .
She &apos;s not as tall as he is .
I want to see them again .
She put the key in her pocket .
What will my parents think ?
He &apos;s doing it right .
You won &apos;t die today .
Are you in the library ?
I want to hear the whole story .
You are the one .
I have just eaten lunch .
Tom will be away for at least a week .
We expect that to happen .
We &apos;re a little behind .
Let &apos;s meet at 2 : 30 .
We &apos;re still together .
You &apos;re a beautiful woman .
Tom kept his mouth shut .
Will you go shopping with me ?
Do you want to talk about it ?
She has three brothers .
We changed everything .
She arrived too early .
My watch has been stolen .
I &apos;m probably going to be busy soon .
I &apos;ve been looking for them for more than one hour .
Why did you kiss Tom ?
Put out the light .
Tom said he wanted some company .
There are a lot of eggs in the box .
Do you know what it says ?
Tom thought Mary wouldn &apos;t likely do that .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a girlfriend .
Children need love .
May I have another piece of cake ?
Are you tired ?
What do you think of my new hat ?
All is well with me .
Who else is going with us ?
How high is it ?
I never thought I &apos;d find a woman like you .
I want more than that .
He had to work even on Sunday .
Tom bought a very good camera .
I am sorry , but this telephone is out of order .
I only want to help Tom .
She suggested that I give it to him right away .
She speaks English really well .
He is getting old , but he is as healthy as ever .
We were both a little drunk .
Tom has never been in love .
We &apos;re lucky that the weather is so nice .
He is quite right .
I love cooking for you .
Where did Tom buy this book ?
Tom never drinks beer at home .
Tom wrote a letter to Mary .
Tom is going to like being here .
What did you want to tell me ?
Tom is very busy .
If you don &apos;t do that , I won &apos;t do that either .
It &apos;s Sunday today .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary his secret .
I do hope you &apos;ll come again .
The post office is closed today .
How is it going with Tom ?
Tom waited , but nobody came .
Tom decided to close early .
Why did you help me ?
Is it popular ?
Tom turned white .
I &apos;ll believe it when I see it .
I already knew the truth .
Tom isn &apos;t looking too good .
Tom wanted to get married , but Mary didn &apos;t .
I have to ask you about Tom .
I didn &apos;t hear any cars .
I &apos;m over here .
Tom looked sad .
He will not go .
Tom has to stop doing this .
Please don &apos;t forget to write the letter .
He had nothing to say , so he left .
I had a good time .
I wondered whether Tom wanted to dance .
You &apos;re the only one I think about .
Not all of us have eaten yet .
What &apos;s with you ?
At which university are you studying ?
They love their children .
Is Tom coming ?
There comes our teacher .
I needed to talk to you .
I want to talk with your uncle .
I made a bad decision .
I took my shoes off .
You shouldn &apos;t do his work .
I think I know the answer .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s job .
Tom was very poor .
I think that &apos;s a good idea .
I began playing golf years ago .
He was alone .
How did you and your wife meet ?
She doesn &apos;t speak to me .
I &apos;m busy , too .
Tom made me angry .
Tom wrote to a friend .
Tom is honest , but Mary isn &apos;t .
Tom may leave .
Could we talk about this later ?
Tom says he doesn &apos;t want to do that with you .
His hair was long last year .
What have you been doing recently ?
I want to hear what you have to say .
I can &apos;t tell you how sorry I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether the concert went well or not .
I know what I &apos;d do .
It isn &apos;t that simple .
Not everybody knows about the plan .
I was impressed with Tom &apos;s French .
The story cannot be true .
Tom drove fast .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
I have to find it .
What else would you like to know ?
Tom called you .
Tom said he needs to learn how to do that .
All the boys are the same age .
Is there still any sugar ?
Tom wants to know why .
All of us speak French .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t yet told anyone they plan to get married .
Tom hasn &apos;t even started studying for the exam yet .
The girl had no one to turn to for advice .
When do you plan to go ?
I can explain it to you if you let me .
What &apos;s the best way to get to the airport from here ?
I &apos;ll start .
I am sure I saw her two years ago .
I don &apos;t think about that .
Tom looked very good .
Tom doesn &apos;t often do that .
I want Tom to succeed .
You don &apos;t follow the rules .
What &apos;s gotten into you ?
They are all dead .
He must be Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom is allowed to do that .
I am glad to help you .
What does Tom want to say to Mary ?
I &apos;m sure that Tom will be here soon .
I can &apos;t lend you any money .
Tom is in love with me .
Tom started it .
I &apos;ll be whatever you want me to be .
Was that your question ?
No one in his class can run faster than he does .
Tom won &apos;t admit that he &apos;s done anything wrong .
Is anyone else hungry ?
Tom could &apos;ve died .
I won &apos;t buy that .
He won &apos;t talk to her and she won &apos;t talk to him .
We went to Boston by bus .
I no longer need them .
Tom will go with us tomorrow .
He talks as if he knew the secret .
They don &apos;t want it .
She knows . She always knows .
I would like to meet him .
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend .
I &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s a good idea .
What made you change your mind ?
Tom came over .
You &apos;ve asked me that three times already .
What a cute baby ! May I hold her ?
Tom will never tell you what really happened .
We &apos;re not coming .
Everyone must die .
I can &apos;t find it . Are you sure it &apos;s here ?
We &apos;ll get to that .
Tom had to answer the phone .
Tom probably did that last Monday .
Tom isn &apos;t going to go with us .
I don &apos;t think I can wait that long .
He &apos;s too old for me .
That doesn &apos;t sound right .
Tom went back to prison .
Tom just wants to spend a little more time with Mary .
What &apos;s it going to be like ?
Tom will be able to do that .
You don &apos;t really know , do you ?
Tom called us .
I was very busy yesterday .
Do they know you &apos;re here ?
I read his book .
We went to London last year .
Where did you spend your vacation ?
It doesn &apos;t bother me to walk in the rain .
Perhaps we could do that tomorrow .
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston because that &apos;s where Mary lives .
Tom is three years younger than Mary is .
You are crazy to lend money to him .
I was just having a little fun .
I want to watch this .
What do you feed your dog ?
I &apos;ll call you in a couple of days .
Tom never told anybody about what happened .
That was not my question .
I should &apos;ve been ready .
It &apos;s much better now .
We &apos;re already old .
It &apos;ll be finished in a day or two .
You can speak French , can &apos;t you ?
Tom has my book .
He is sure to come .
Tom read the book Mary gave him .
Everything is possible .
It must be true .
What are you doing this evening ?
The concert wasn &apos;t very good .
Tom wants to quit .
What is it you &apos;d like to know ?
Could he be Tom &apos;s son ?
Tom ate the cake and drank the tea .
I want to be like Tom .
Do you remember what I taught you ?
I saw him .
Tom went back to Boston yesterday .
What &apos;s that building ?
Tom was a bad person .
Do you have a problem with me ?
I was planning to do that , but I never got the chance .
How much money does Tom make ?
I need to have a talk with you .
I guess that you can &apos;t do it .
Where did you get that suit ?
Where have you been all this time ?
Please take me to my seat .
I ride a bike to work .
I &apos;m only going to be here for three weeks .
Why couldn &apos;t you do that ?
I think now is the time .
I &apos;m watching TV now .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sister .
I like it very much .
Tom came early .
What are those ?
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom ?
What are you doing out here ?
I &apos;m thinking as fast as I can .
I don &apos;t have a house in Boston .
There is a key on the desk .
It &apos;s a TV .
This isn &apos;t the first time that you &apos;ve been late .
I don &apos;t care what your mother said .
Are you all by yourself ?
Go back to your seat .
Are we alone ?
Why don &apos;t you like it here ?
It &apos;s difficult to help people when they don &apos;t want your help .
Tom wants to have a talk with Mary .
They &apos;ll love that .
I want to live at home with my family .
It &apos;s got to be now .
I &apos;m so bored right now .
Have you read it ?
Are all of them your friends ?
Tom doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
I didn &apos;t go shopping yesterday .
I &apos;m on the phone with Tom now .
I &apos;ll call .
Tom said Mary is a good mom .
The boy made fun of the girl .
Come with me .
Will you come and see me ?
Tom and I both don &apos;t understand French at all .
I &apos;ll be back later today .
Isn &apos;t that what Tom said ?
I must apologize for not having written for such a long time .
He plays golf every Sunday .
Tom wanted to learn to read .
Maybe Tom likes you .
Tom hasn &apos;t changed a bit .
It wasn &apos;t funny .
I haven &apos;t told anyone , not even Tom .
It is very kind of you to help me .
Tom asked Mary why she was late .
I really should be getting to bed .
Tom stopped it .
Tom listened to music in his room until late at night .
You should get what you want .
She has yet to answer any of the questions .
Tom told me to talk to Mary about that .
I managed to finish the book .
You seem to know everyone here .
Tom has one of those .
I waited up for him until ten o &apos;clock .
I stopped laughing .
How much longer do you think it &apos;ll take ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to listen to us .
You can &apos;t make everybody happy .
Tom spent three years in prison for what he did .
He comes to visit us every now and then .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like me ?
It is too hot .
Where &apos;s the map ?
That &apos;s what I don &apos;t know .
Has Tom arrived ?
Tell Tom I &apos;m not interested in the car he &apos;s trying to sell .
Give Tom a second chance .
Tom sometimes plays tennis with Mary .
Nobody was listening .
We have to go there together .
Tom might be hungry .
Tom left quickly .
I like living here .
It &apos;s not going to be easy to decide .
They trust Tom .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might need to do that today .
I study English after dinner .
Is it true that you came by plane ?
Everybody likes her .
Tom didn &apos;t learn anything in school .
Why didn &apos;t you ask me ?
They don &apos;t know that .
I didn &apos;t actually hit Tom .
Can I open the window ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have as many friends as Mary does .
I &apos;m going .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a sister .
I think Tom knew .
How long will you stay in Tokyo ?
I just don &apos;t feel like it .
Let &apos;s play house .
It makes you happy , doesn &apos;t it ?
Tom hasn &apos;t bought milk yet .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll get it .
I think Tom might be telling the truth .
I &apos;m never going to be able to do that without your help .
I thought I was losing my mind .
Tom is getting nervous .
Tom finally came home .
She looked at me and smiled .
I tried to help her .
Have you ever kissed a girl ?
Do you think he will like that ?
I &apos;m not that happy .
Tom drank a beer .
Tom didn &apos;t even know how to write his own name .
I &apos;ll be going with you .
Is that your son ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not half as glad as I am .
I hope we &apos;ll never have to do that again .
I heard that Tom is sick .
It is because he is honest that I like him .
Her husband wants to have his own way in everything .
Tom could &apos;ve said something , but he didn &apos;t .
Everyone knew that .
They may not be home .
Tom called me back .
I hope that she &apos;ll get well soon .
The girl standing there is Mary .
Tom says he &apos;s very rich .
I thought you said someone was going to meet us .
I want you out here .
He came again after a week .
This is where my family used to live .
I think Tom might be in Boston right now .
At about the same time , Tom was in his room studying .
Are you healthy ?
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
This is your last chance .
I &apos;m very glad to see you .
Tom tried to blame me for everything .
It doesn &apos;t belong to you .
I &apos;ve only known Tom for a few months .
Why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
Don &apos;t drink the water .
I &apos;m married now .
You may do that if you &apos;d like to .
I know where she is .
You &apos;re as beautiful as ever .
It &apos;s very cold today .
Tom will start .
Why were you there ?
I saw Tom in Boston .
I &apos;m from America .
I &apos;m looking for Tom .
Look at those .
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk .
I never do that .
My mother gets up earlier than anyone else .
What we had to do was really quite simple .
I can &apos;t think of his name .
What &apos;s the use ?
This is how I learned English .
She is kind to old people .
The library has many books .
I &apos;m going to Europe next week .
Who are you afraid of ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem happy .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
Is this good French ?
He likes animals .
Go to sleep , Tom . You need to wake up early tomorrow morning .
I &apos;m not too good at this game .
I &apos;m waiting for my boyfriend .
I need his help .
That was the answer I wanted .
Why do you think that Tom did that ?
I love life .
What did that suggest to you ?
I &apos;m asking you to do me a favor .
I will telephone you later on .
Tom eats anything .
I don &apos;t know why I &apos;m scared .
I wish I had more money with me .
Don &apos;t ever do that again .
This work is by no means easy .
The man has no house to live in .
I will be leaving for Australia next month .
I haven &apos;t eaten lunch yet .
Tom knows I &apos;m home .
Tom asked Mary if she knew his new address .
They say he is very rich .
I see where this is going .
I wish Tom had waited for me .
Do you want to do it ?
I forgot his address .
What comes next ?
I don &apos;t know how to explain it .
I hear that he &apos;s very rich .
Tom is doing what he has to do .
Tom must decide what to do right away .
Tom waited for Mary for three hours .
He read the book yesterday .
I often think about the place where I met you .
I decided to give Tom another chance .
Tom &apos;s missing .
People Tom &apos;s age don &apos;t make new friends easily .
Tom asked Mary for some money so he could buy something to eat .
I always feel hungry .
I started to worry .
Tom knows we &apos;re coming .
It seems that you &apos;re very busy today .
I want to know where it is .
He is old enough to understand it .
This is your book .
How do you know my father ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary meant .
Who would buy this ?
Tom heard something and went to find out what it was .
Tom got into the car .
Nobody knows why .
I know how to use this .
I thought you said Tom was your brother .
I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Can I come over ?
What do you have to say about that ?
We definitely need Tom &apos;s help .
Tom left the office at 2 : 30 .
I meant to thank you for your help .
I &apos;ve often heard Tom say that .
Were you listening to the radio yesterday ?
I &apos;ve heard of you .
How much does it cost ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary can speak French .
They &apos;re using you .
How do they do that ?
I would like to see it .
Tom is looking at us .
Do you expect me to believe that ?
You leave me no choice .
I love everything about you .
Tom loves kids .
No one was to be seen on the street .
&quot; Will he come home soon ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid not . &quot;
I don &apos;t know if I want to marry Tom .
We don &apos;t make mistakes .
Tom said it didn &apos;t matter .
She was invited to a party .
I play tennis .
We should not have done that . It was wrong .
I &apos;ll call you at seven .
Tom will make a good doctor .
Tom may go to Boston tomorrow .
It was your mistake , not mine .
I &apos;m trying to figure out a solution .
How old is your cat ?
They are talking about what they will sing .
Have you written to Tom ?
What are we going to do about that ?
They lied .
She began to sing .
The whole class is present today .
Tom tried to swim .
I don &apos;t know how long it &apos;ll last .
What &apos;s Tom going to say about this ?
Tom is sound asleep .
Tom refused to help me .
Tom &apos;s life is in danger .
I need a cup of hot coffee .
I missed my bus this morning .
That &apos;s one of my dogs .
Don &apos;t look at Tom .
I have no doubt about it .
I know what Tom is doing .
Do you want to know who I am ?
Are you OK ?
Tom took some money out of his pocket .
Tom asked me if I wanted to do that today .
Tom is with his mother .
I think I know what you need .
Tom just might get better .
I like this book .
She had tears in her eyes .
Tom is getting ready .
Tom lives all by himself .
It is interesting to play soccer .
Both of us want to see the movie .
What is the weather like today ?
You like everyone .
They weren &apos;t at home yesterday .
Tom stood up .
Someone told me Mary left her husband .
I did this for you .
I should learn French .
I arrived late last night .
Yesterday I heard you talking in your sleep .
I am tired .
Tom and Mary will take care of John .
He seems quite happy .
I said too much .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to go to school today .
Ask yourself why .
It &apos;s news to me .
I knew you &apos;d get it .
Tom sat down on the couch .
Is Tom with Mary ?
I &apos;ve just been to the post office .
I thought doing this would be easy , but we &apos;ve been working all day and we &apos;re still not finished .
These aren &apos;t real .
Are your hands clean ?
It is said that she is a good cook .
I &apos;ve never seen you in a dress before .
We &apos;re going to get you home .
I want to thank you for all your help .
Mary is Tom &apos;s daughter .
I sometimes drive too fast .
What &apos;s Tom doing in Boston ?
Tom was sitting between Mary and John .
I &apos;ll call back later .
What did you do ?
I forgot to explain everything to Tom .
I started writing .
This is good for me .
Tom walked Mary to the door and she left .
Is Tom dangerous ?
Which train will you arrive on ?
Tom is always short of money .
Not much soccer is played there .
Tom was leaving .
She invited me over for coffee .
I &apos;ve never seen you so nervous .
He &apos;s a big boy .
What &apos;s up ?
I was very disappointed when I heard the news .
She wrote one letter .
Tom can play tennis very well .
Tom should probably do that tomorrow .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t tell her that we hadn &apos;t done our homework .
Do you want to go with us ?
I want to believe you .
I don &apos;t want to become rich and famous .
Let &apos;s speak in French .
I &apos;m drinking coffee .
Tom wanted to talk to me about something .
What can you tell me about it ?
I &apos;m careful .
This is the best movie I &apos;ve ever seen .
A little bird told me .
Tom wants to be like me .
I heard what happened .
I don &apos;t know English .
Have some .
I bought a new suit .
Tom doesn &apos;t know who to ask .
It &apos;s my mistake , not yours .
Tom isn &apos;t watching .
I made this for Tom .
Tom looked hurt .
Tom asked Mary where she lived , but she wouldn &apos;t tell him .
I can get it from Tom .
What is this ?
I asked Tom to give me a second chance .
Everything had happened so quickly .
I said get up !
Did you invite Tom ?
I &apos;ll have to explain that to my father .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
I &apos;m three years older than you .
Is this your bicycle ?
I have a new car .
I could learn something from you , I think .
Do you believe in love at the first sight ?
Let &apos;s take the bus .
I think I speak French very well .
He found out the secret .
Tom &apos;s not going to be happy .
She doesn &apos;t have any brothers .
Why don &apos;t you ask Tom for advice ?
It &apos;s broken .
This is Mary &apos;s dog .
I &apos;m being looked after .
I don &apos;t have anything to give to you .
I don &apos;t play the piano .
Tom began to like Mary more and more .
They don &apos;t want you here .
Tom is Mary &apos;s brother , not her father .
She cannot stop him .
Have fun .
Tom went shopping yesterday .
It &apos;s out of the question .
There &apos;s no sugar in my tea .
The teacher has three times as many books as I do .
Where can I get the airport bus ?
Everyone does what he wants .
I &apos;ll see you on Monday in Boston .
Why do you know so much about Australia ?
He says he likes flowers .
I go to school with him .
Do you know where they are ?
You should have seen it .
It &apos;s too long .
Can &apos;t we just talk this over ?
No one thinks that way anymore .
I found some money .
We &apos;d like to speak with Tom .
I haven &apos;t heard this song in a long time .
Tom and Mary are going to get married next month .
Tom seems to be sick .
I can &apos;t help laughing at him .
You can trust him .
Are you shy ?
This book is a must for every student studying English .
Tom turned the TV off .
Tom doesn &apos;t feel like eating .
I don &apos;t drink much beer .
I &apos;m going to Tom &apos;s house .
What &apos;re you doing in my office ?
We have enough food now .
She seems to be sick .
I don &apos;t have the courage to ask my boss to lend me his car .
I &apos;ll drink to that .
What are you looking at ?
Tom heard Mary call for help .
I should &apos;ve known this .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you .
I want to read it .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me .
Someone stole Tom &apos;s bicycle .
He speaks really well .
If I don &apos;t do that , someone else will have to do it .
Have you already tried not thinking of anything ?
Nobody likes them .
I &apos;ll speak to Tom about that .
Tom said he wanted to go .
I &apos;ve been driving this car for three years .
I can &apos;t tell you how much I appreciate all your help .
I think what we just heard was Tom &apos;s voice .
That girl has become a woman .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like this hotel ?
I like to read jokes .
Don &apos;t do it again .
That &apos;ll be fun .
I &apos;ve often wondered what it must be like to be rich .
I really ought to go .
They know everything .
It isn &apos;t expensive .
I &apos;m always hungry .
English is not hard to learn .
You don &apos;t need that .
I &apos;m here .
I really feel for you .
We have a lot of homework .
Tom has already finished the work .
Isn &apos;t that good news ?
When does he get back from his trip ?
I &apos;m really sorry about Tom .
What do we tell Tom ?
You don &apos;t have to tell me twice .
You &apos;re not looking .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
Tom can help .
No one was watching .
Tom told me this would only take three hours .
I &apos;ll be home late today .
I think he likes me .
What exactly is the difference ?
I don &apos;t want to be like that .
He &apos;s never been better .
I &apos;ll take care of you .
We all want you to be happy .
I asked Tom where he had gone for lunch .
Tom has visited Boston three times .
Are those guys your friends ?
I know what his name is .
Please call me when you have decided what you would like to do .
Did you get Tom &apos;s message ?
We have the best team ever .
You can &apos;t say that .
The old man walked across the road carefully .
Tom thought about what Mary said .
I wonder who the people I saw her with were .
Tom is the only boy here who doesn &apos;t like baseball .
We &apos;re not going to find anything .
Tom has already left for work .
Tom is lying on the bench .
It was lucky that nobody died .
We could understand each other .
Tom told me that I should spend more time with my family .
That was fast .
I &apos;ll help you all I can .
I got my leg hurt in the accident .
I don &apos;t get paid as much as I &apos;d like .
Tom said his job was a lot of fun .
Please come here soon if you don &apos;t mind .
I fell in love with you .
I &apos;m not interested in talking to her .
I &apos;m as tall as my father .
Don &apos;t kid about that .
Tom met a girl about his age .
I haven &apos;t seen him in a few days .
I want to see the movie .
I know as little as you do .
It &apos;s a good start .
What &apos;re you reading ?
It &apos;s best not to ask .
It was already too late .
I &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .
Tom looks angry .
I knew who did it .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was pretty .
Can you give me this one , please ?
You know Tom likes Boston .
We have to find out what we &apos;re supposed to do .
I lied .
She doesn &apos;t listen to him .
Tom saw Mary running .
Tom turned the light back on .
I can only speak for myself .
How far is it to the station ?
You were drunk , weren &apos;t you ?
He always takes his time in everything he does .
I didn &apos;t spend all day with Tom .
Everybody &apos;s crying .
There &apos;s a woman waiting over there who wants to talk to you .
Tom came here to help me .
Tom was the first guy who broke my heart .
Take a look in there .
That &apos;s his .
Is he Tom ?
Not all children like apples .
I saw Tom coming .
My English is not good at all .
Is Tom going to swim tomorrow ?
I won &apos;t tell Tom .
I will never have a daughter .
That &apos;s OK with Tom .
Whose son are you ?
I worked in Boston for three years .
Tom felt completely at home .
I no longer need it .
I can &apos;t go to Australia with you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where it is .
They left one after another .
Has the world gone mad ?
Tom is playing with his son .
I &apos;ll go tell Tom .
These are the names .
It happens .
Tom believed me .
She looks sad .
I found something .
Tom is watching TV .
Tom is worried about the boys .
We don &apos;t think Tom killed Mary .
Tom speaks three languages .
She has lived with us since last summer .
Tom has lost interest in studying French .
Tom has been looking for you .
There has been no rain here for the past two weeks .
We &apos;re not very good .
I &apos;m glad Tom is gone .
Would you mind if I asked you some questions ?
I can help you if you let me .
You have three cats .
Aren &apos;t you from Boston as well ?
You had better have your car washed .
This is the end of my story .
He has already finished his work .
Tom knew better .
I will stay home tomorrow .
Tom is about to leave .
What do you want anyway ?
Tom &apos;s left .
Tom isn &apos;t my friend anymore .
I &apos;m going to my sister &apos;s .
What do you want me to do with Tom ?
I told you it was too soon .
Tom never seems to know what to say .
Don &apos;t come after me .
Tom and Mary are my best friends .
Tom started taking things out of the box .
Tom is coming for dinner . Do you want to stay ?
Go home . Get some rest .
Tom loves this .
He lives near the beach .
Have you made your decision ?
I don &apos;t know this road .
I &apos;ll ask him if he will come .
There is nothing here .
Tom was my daughter &apos;s best friend .
I &apos;ll be leaving now .
He &apos;s still young .
Would you help me look for my keys ?
That &apos;s what I have to do .
Is it really true ?
I don &apos;t know why Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat .
What &apos;s going on with you ?
I asked him to come at eight , but he turned up at nine .
Tom caught the ball .
Tom left after me .
I can &apos;t play this piece .
Tom , you don &apos;t have to do that .
Tom kept working .
What does all this have to do with Tom ?
Tom thought Mary had already gone home .
When I see him , I think of my grandfather .
Do people still actually use that word ?
You haven &apos;t seen the last of me .
You &apos;ll love this .
Tom has no idea why Mary did that .
I &apos;m not sure what Tom meant by that .
What is it you &apos;re doing ?
I &apos;d love to live in Boston .
Tom is going to school in Boston .
Her dog isn &apos;t very fast .
I don &apos;t quite know yet .
Thank you for everything you have done for me .
I &apos;m interested in music .
I wish that I hadn &apos;t kissed Tom .
You &apos;d better stop smoking .
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom .
Tom can hear Mary very well .
I have a list here .
I asked Tom to keep quiet .
We &apos;ve done what we can to help .
I want to be happy .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got much time .
Tom is expecting to meet you here .
Tom is well paid .
I can &apos;t listen to this anymore .
He wrote a book while in China .
Tom said that he and Mary were planning to visit Australia next year .
This was all a mistake .
I &apos;m not sure I want to see this .
You &apos;ll have to ask somebody else .
Why are you at home ?
I really don &apos;t want to go out on a date with Mary .
Let Tom decide .
Tom will be looking after the children while I &apos;m at work .
I want you to be nice to Tom .
Let me in .
Tom refused to answer the question .
You &apos;ll have to work a lot .
Where &apos;s my breakfast ?
Here &apos;s my telephone number .
I know that &apos;s not true .
Tom thought that Mary was asleep .
I didn &apos;t know that Tom didn &apos;t know how to swim .
Tom doesn &apos;t pay attention in class .
I didn &apos;t mean that to happen .
Can you stop calling me that ?
There is a clock on the wall .
I could hardly close the suitcase .
My family didn &apos;t have much money .
I work in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
Tom wasn &apos;t drunk .
Don &apos;t you think I look like Tom ?
Tom will cook .
Tom took off his hat .
She may not come .
What &apos;re you going to do with Tom ?
What are you doing to me ?
I found it easy to speak English .
I wanted to stay there two days longer .
Tom got very hot .
I &apos;d like a cup of coffee , please .
Tom decided not to move to Boston .
Go that way .
This is very simple .
It could take up to three months to finish this .
Tom wants to buy Mary a present .
I wanted Tom to do that .
That &apos;s not where I want to go .
Tom lives in Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend .
He asked me for money .
I &apos;ll ask my father for money .
Why did you agree to spend the evening with Tom ?
You &apos;ll find both of the books interesting .
Let &apos;s talk about your job .
I can still hear your voice .
The room is quite small .
Why do you want to help the police ?
Who gave this to Tom ?
Tom is getting fat .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen talking to you .
Tom told Mary that he &apos;d kissed Alice .
Tom was also there .
I wish Tom could be here with us today .
He is taller than any other boy .
He is taking a day off today .
How can you tell ?
How did it happen ?
He can run faster than I can .
It was nice talking to you .
I &apos;d like to show this picture of Tom to you .
Tom seems to know a lot about Australia .
I can &apos;t make out what she said .
Get out !
You don &apos;t want to go to Boston , do you ?
I &apos;ll be glad when it &apos;s over .
You &apos;ll never be alone .
Tom wants to get married , but not to Mary .
He had friends all over the world .
I can &apos;t afford to pay so much .
Tom appears to be sleeping .
Has Tom ever written a letter in French ?
I need a favor .
I have to do my homework .
I do not understand her .
I &apos;m just lucky .
Can you open the window ?
Here &apos;s what I think .
Tom hates these things .
My son is not old enough for school .
Tom comes here almost every day .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like your new job .
Tom has children .
It makes me feel alive .
Tom asked Mary if she would help him .
He is an American .
My camera is much better than his .
I don &apos;t want to live my life like this .
Tom doesn &apos;t do things like that .
I love dogs .
Her husband is now living in Tokyo .
They &apos;re part of us .
I don &apos;t want to get married .
Tom is saying something .
Tom is out of work .
Bring that here .
Tom can borrow my car for a few days .
She advised him to take the medicine .
I ate way too much .
We &apos;re safe here .
What can you do for me ?
When did Tom learn to dance ?
I want you to stay on the beach .
I want to know why Tom isn &apos;t here .
I &apos;m behind you .
He got angry with us .
I don &apos;t believe a word Tom says .
I &apos;ll never lose hope .
I need to learn Japanese .
&quot; Let &apos;s dance together . &quot; &quot; I thought you &apos;d never ask . &quot;
Tom is in the kitchen helping his mother .
Did you ever call Tom ?
Can you swim across this river ?
I still have your key .
I can &apos;t help you with that .
When did your family arrive in Boston ?
Tom went out of the room .
Nobody loves war .
Why can &apos;t we just tell Tom that we can &apos;t do it ?
You can do what you want .
I &apos;ve already tried doing that three times .
You know how it is .
I should &apos;ve told you that you didn &apos;t need to buy any more sugar .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know .
Tom can &apos;t even write his own name .
I can &apos;t see without my glasses .
Tom told me that Mary quit smoking .
He can barely read .
I walked alone .
Nobody asked .
Please show me your driver &apos;s license .
He is kind at heart .
The train doesn &apos;t stop here .
What &apos;s it we &apos;re waiting for ?
This is too expensive !
Thanks .
It &apos;s their choice .
He doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
I don &apos;t think that he will come .
Tom is so happy .
That &apos;s what I like about Tom .
Tom is sleeping .
I &apos;ll be free this evening .
Tom knew there was something in the box , but he didn &apos;t know what .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to work here anymore .
Tom &apos;s clothes were old , but clean .
Tom took me for my brother .
What are they saying ?
I really have to do this work today .
I love being right .
Has Tom ever kissed you ?
He hit me in the face .
Tom came home by bus .
They love us .
I think Tom is here .
I just never seemed to fit in there .
I bought the book .
It is likely to rain today .
Tom probably got tired of waiting for Mary and left .
Tom isn &apos;t looking at Mary .
They &apos;re dancing .
What do you say to that , Tom ?
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s wife like ?
She used to love him .
He sat next to me .
I &apos;m very proud of my son .
I gave Tom one of those .
Have you seen my new car ?
I must visit my friend in the hospital .
We seldom speak French here .
I have only half as many books as he does .
We &apos;re looking forward to that .
These are yours .
They &apos;re not going to give up .
Did your uncle let you drive his car ?
Tom has left .
I &apos;m sorry . I forgot about this .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever been this busy .
Tom and Mary got married just three months after they first met each other .
Do you feel like eating ?
I don &apos;t think he knows I love you .
There &apos;s more .
That desk does not fit in this room .
Is it true that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s brother ?
I &apos;m already on it .
Tom walked out .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I &apos;d like to see you again .
Tom came to sit with me on the sofa .
You &apos;re still in love with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom needs someone to talk to .
Tom is probably going to be tired when he gets home .
You are a doctor .
She is living abroad .
Tom is dying to see Mary .
I &apos;m going to need some help .
We &apos;ve already done that .
We can &apos;t turn back .
Tom said he thought that I was dead .
I met him yesterday .
No one will hold us back .
I would do it again .
We need to leave .
Tom said that he thought Mary needed to do that before she left .
We don &apos;t belong in here .
I look forward to your next visit .
We &apos;ve waited a long time for this day .
The dog needs water .
They might tell us the truth .
Why aren &apos;t you dancing ?
I go to the library at least once a week .
I met him once when I was a student .
No matter who says so , I can &apos;t believe that .
We &apos;ll begin work soon .
Why is he so nice to me ?
I &apos;m not angry at all of you .
I own a horse .
We should go to sleep .
I don &apos;t have a problem with this .
Tom looks a bit tired .
This one &apos;s for you .
Do you want me to go now ?
Do you know where I live ?
We don &apos;t have much time . Let &apos;s hurry .
That has nothing to do with this problem .
Do you know this ?
Tom has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
They say that he was very poor when he was young .
I wonder why .
What time is your train ?
What &apos;s your mother &apos;s name ?
We &apos;re getting there .
They want us to do it .
You &apos;re a good student , but you still have a lot to learn .
If it &apos;s all right with you , I &apos;d like to stay for a while longer .
Tom took it .
Tom says he &apos;ll give it a try .
That sounds very interesting .
He gave me all his money .
How did you know that would happen ?
Can you make room for me ?
I &apos;ve been living here for many years .
I just arrived .
That was easy .
You need to be honest with me .
Do you regret what happened ?
He needs that money .
He lives in Tokyo .
I still can &apos;t believe it !
All I can say is that I &apos;d rather not go .
It &apos;ll break .
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can .
I know what I &apos;m saying .
It appears you &apos;re correct , Tom .
I &apos;ve worked three hours already .
I can &apos;t just leave . I have to tell the boss I &apos;m leaving .
He was disappointed at not being invited .
Tom isn &apos;t going to stop Mary .
Tom likes the idea .
Do you speak French every day ?
Did you see the accident with your own eyes ?
Tom helped me fix my watch .
I &apos;ve invited all my friends .
My brother speaks very fast .
Tom said I &apos;m supposed to be here for Mary .
Don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know how to drive .
Tom is going to look after Mary .
Tom will pay for everything .
That was never my problem .
I heard Tom singing in the kitchen .
Tom left five minutes ago .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to know he was rich .
I have to be there before seven .
She ran as fast as she could .
Tom didn &apos;t do it .
Tom knew who Mary was planning to marry .
Can you play guitar ?
Which team will win ?
It &apos;s what Tom had .
Who did you speak with ?
Tom said it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
I don &apos;t do it anymore .
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s going on .
I need to see you in my office .
I &apos;m coming with Tom .
We don &apos;t need your money .
Everyone &apos;s different .
Christmas comes but once a year .
Did they ever find Tom ?
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry ?
Tom isn &apos;t a good father .
You may read this book .
I &apos;ll give you five minutes to work out this problem .
When did Tom say that ?
He likes it when I do that .
It &apos;d be better if you didn &apos;t come today .
Did something happen ?
Tom is the one who asked for help .
No one is going with me .
We don &apos;t have a choice . We have to do this .
My name was first on the list .
Tom could still be alive somewhere .
He would be glad to hear that .
What have I missed now ?
I &apos;m a little tired .
They &apos;re back .
Tom thinks Mary is very cute .
I don &apos;t ever drink and drive .
It seems warm outside .
Tom has decided to go .
I can &apos;t do it by myself .
We &apos;ve been here for a while .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary &apos;s help .
Is that a question ?
He told her that he loved her .
I think I agree .
What can you teach me ?
You &apos;re not good at this .
They &apos;re like family .
He gave me his phone number .
Tom , your life &apos;s in danger .
You guys need new shoes .
I can name names .
I need a pencil . Can I use one of yours ?
Tom didn &apos;t let Mary in .
Who wrote this book ?
My dad &apos;s not here .
What &apos;s the horse &apos;s name ?
I don &apos;t like this movie .
She felt like dancing .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll succeed .
I get on with him well .
Tom would &apos;ve liked what you said .
No one ever asked .
It is something like a ball .
They &apos;re not mine .
If Tom goes swimming , so will I .
I will not go to school tomorrow .
Perhaps he could solve this problem .
She can drive a car .
Mary just got her hair done .
I have been living here for three years .
Tom likes to study in the library .
I &apos;d already thought of that .
Can I talk to you for just a second ?
That girl looks like a boy .
You &apos;re welcome to stay .
Can &apos;t you speak French ?
Tom takes the bus to work .
Tom is going , too .
This beautiful house is so expensive that we can &apos;t buy it .
Our car broke down last night .
I &apos;d like to read your new book .
I don &apos;t like what Tom is doing .
Tom is in his room sleeping .
I don &apos;t want to go with Tom .
You &apos;re not very happy , are you ?
He came in and immediately sat down .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary anything about that .
Mary died three hours after her husband .
Tom says that he &apos;s too tired to study .
Are Tom and Mary really married ?
Tom is in need of help .
What street do you live on ?
I need to ask a favor .
Did Tom kiss Mary ?
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend ?
We can &apos;t talk here .
You need it .
What &apos;ll you eat for dinner tonight ?
Tom slept for a few hours .
Tom is against smoking .
Tom can &apos;t hear anything .
Tom definitely wants to do that .
Tom spent the night at a friend &apos;s house .
I &apos;m the only person Tom knows in this town .
Did anybody else see it ?
I feel strong .
It doesn &apos;t always happen .
I don &apos;t like it when you &apos;re so busy .
We &apos;re the problem .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t need my help .
This room is too hot to study in . I can &apos;t stand it any more .
I got him to clean my room .
Tom called me today .
I am sick and tired of him .
Tom ate all the bread .
It &apos;s me .
Is he a doctor ?
Tom asked if Mary was married .
I don &apos;t know how old Tom is now .
I saw this coming .
Tom may not want to go .
I want to live in the city .
What have we here ?
We &apos;ll soon change that .
He told me not to swim there .
Tom became bored .
Tom got changed .
I have enough money to buy it .
It had to be done .
I don &apos;t agree at all .
It &apos;s just over there .
Tom threw me an apple .
He taught me how to write .
There is a lot of work to do .
We &apos;ve got to hurry .
What &apos;s wrong with you two ?
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus .
Please take good care of yourself .
You never should &apos;ve gone there by yourself .
We &apos;re correct .
I want money .
I &apos;ll let you know when it has been decided .
She &apos;s taller than him .
I bought her a clock .
I &apos;m planning to come .
I want one .
Tom and Mary must love each other very much .
Maybe we can help Tom .
The car hit a tree .
Why don &apos;t you just tell Tom ?
She is looked up to by her friends .
I no longer love you .
It could have been anyone .
Just leave Tom alone .
Tom isn &apos;t a child anymore .
Does Tom know how to do this ?
Tom drinks .
I want a drink .
Don &apos;t you have a boyfriend ?
Tom will walk to school tomorrow .
I got home yesterday afternoon at about 2 : 30 .
I drank beer last night .
We play tennis after school .
He can &apos;t make a decision .
I don &apos;t know if I can do that or not .
It &apos;s about time you went to bed .
I &apos;ve lost hope .
This is my other sister .
Tom has lost his job .
That &apos;s the one .
Do you have a friend that can help you ?
The train is leaving soon .
Can you please tell me what &apos;s happening ?
Tom may be home on Monday .
Tom was just about to say something when Mary walked into the room .
I have a lot to do .
Tom didn &apos;t need my help .
I could have done it without your help .
How much time is left ?
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a long time .
Can you tell me a little about yourself ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how Mary will get to school tomorrow .
Did you read them ?
I don &apos;t really know Tom very well .
Where &apos;s your friend ?
How do you like this town ?
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s office ?
It looks fun . Why don &apos;t we try it ?
She finished reading the letter .
Tom has helped a lot .
I wish we &apos;d bought another bottle of wine .
It &apos;s Christmas .
My car was stolen last night .
I like dogs very much .
You &apos;re my girlfriend .
Today is Monday .
I &apos;m waiting for my mother .
My mother is not always at home .
Who taught you French ?
This ought to be fun .
Tom said Mary is ready .
Tom has been nice to everybody .
What made you ask me that ?
What else is there to say ?
I tried to act impressed .
Do you want me to go to Boston ?
My children are at school .
I can &apos;t go when I haven &apos;t been invited .
Tom finished his coffee .
I don &apos;t want Tom to see this .
I &apos;m happy that Tom is here .
That must be what love looks like .
We &apos;re tired .
Call me at nine tomorrow morning .
I know where Tom is going .
We &apos;re so busy .
Tom and Mary want to talk to us a moment .
I don &apos;t have to be here .
I think I have a right to know .
No one saw Tom take it .
You have to study more .
Did you guys hear that ?
You aren &apos;t going to do that , are you ?
What &apos;re you doing with Tom &apos;s stuff ?
We have to close the window .
Are you a teacher here or a student ?
Tom needs to do that every morning .
I &apos;ve learned so much .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary doesn &apos;t like him .
I wouldn &apos;t do that for all the money in the world .
I would be happy to help you .
I know why you want this job .
Did Tom help ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the movie .
Tom thought that Mary loved him .
The story was very interesting .
I could swim well even when I was a child .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand French .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when it &apos;ll happen , but he &apos;s pretty sure that it will happen .
Tom is always like that .
I &apos;d like not to do it .
You know that &apos;s a lie .
Do you have your driver &apos;s license ?
We all die .
His passport was stolen .
I have three cats .
I must see it .
I wanted to do that with you .
I tried not to laugh .
Can you teach me French ?
I was in the hospital for a week .
I didn &apos;t hear you coming .
He became famous .
This gift is for you .
I did what you told me to do .
May I visit you tomorrow ?
You should tell the truth .
Tom needs rest .
Tom won &apos;t leave .
You had better learn either English or French .
I can solve this problem .
I love the people here .
I never saw her again .
I &apos;m just watching television .
Tom stayed at home all day .
Tom seldom comes to see me .
Tom just wanted to ask Mary a few questions .
Tom left Mary in the room by herself .
We went to the beach to swim .
He is married with two children .
Tom doesn &apos;t know that I &apos;m here .
What is the name of that bird ?
Tom won &apos;t be disappointed .
I know what you &apos;re saying .
What &apos;ll you do ?
Just give me the phone .
I &apos;m glad I could help you .
We knew enough .
Do you have a son ?
Come in , Tom .
I don &apos;t remember exactly .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
If you speak French , I won &apos;t understand .
We &apos;re not going to Boston .
I wasn &apos;t even there .
Tom may be studying French .
Tom gave up smoking .
When will we go back ?
I hope the weather will hold for another day .
When will it be ready ?
I like to be here .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe what had happened .
You should do it like this .
It was dark and I couldn &apos;t see anything .
I wish I had an explanation .
Why didn &apos;t you bring your hat today ?
I don &apos;t know why everyone &apos;s so tired .
Can you swim at all ?
I &apos;ll come and see you one of these days .
I &apos;m very sorry for being late .
Did you come by car ?
It doesn &apos;t matter to Tom .
I told Tom he shouldn &apos;t drink that .
Tom isn &apos;t mad at you .
Why are you doing this to yourself ?
This wine is very expensive .
He &apos;s my age .
I remember seeing you last year .
Tom says Mary isn &apos;t happy .
I have the key .
You don &apos;t have to do this for me .
Why didn &apos;t you phone before coming ?
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all do that .
Tom came here by bicycle .
He likes to run .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak much French .
I don &apos;t know what to do either .
How many people did you invite ?
You are not able to swim , are you ?
Tom was there with one of his friends .
We stayed in Boston for about a week .
I used to be like you .
Do you know how to drive ?
Why were you late this morning ?
He isn &apos;t perfect .
You &apos;re kind .
Tom has to go to the bank .
Tom meant it .
My mother is in the kitchen .
We shouldn &apos;t swim here .
Tom is wanted by the police .
I no longer like you .
He gave up hope .
Get some rest .
Let Tom do that .
Tom got upset and left .
Where were you when Tom needed your help ?
That &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t know where Tom lives .
I asked Tom to leave .
Will you tell him I called ?
Are you sure that &apos;s necessary ?
The baby was sound asleep .
It became clear that she had told a lie .
We &apos;re not rich .
Thanks for the food .
Please don &apos;t use French .
Did you invite him ?
Tom found me a job .
You don &apos;t have to be alone anymore .
You don &apos;t really know me .
I bought it for ten dollars .
Please let me take your picture .
I have bad news for you .
Are we sure about this ?
Tom , what do you say ?
You should stay in school .
I &apos;m going to talk to Tom when he comes home .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
There is no milk left .
I &apos;m not really hungry .
It was so dark .
You have to be there by 2 : 30 .
Tom lost his umbrella .
The shirt is large for me .
I don &apos;t think that Tom has a dog .
Tom and I both like to play golf .
Tom fell and broke his arm .
He went to Paris by car yesterday .
May I open my eyes now ?
I liked Tom better before he got married .
That &apos;s great .
I &apos;m not about to stop .
Tom isn &apos;t doing that .
I &apos;ve been working in Boston for three years .
Is today your birthday ?
This is the house where he was born .
We need to take this very seriously .
Our teacher seemed surprised .
I still haven &apos;t finished eating breakfast .
Tom hasn &apos;t done anything .
They say that he was born in Germany .
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of anything .
This is the only tie I have .
Are we safe ?
It was nothing .
I &apos;ve only done this once before .
What do you do here ?
This window won &apos;t open .
I wrote this letter in French .
There &apos;s a reason for it .
Tom believes Mary made the right choice .
I think Tom wouldn &apos;t mind .
That should please everyone .
Tom &apos;s not in his car .
Are you sisters ?
It &apos;s my umbrella .
I &apos;ve never been to Boston , and I don &apos;t intend to ever go there .
The boy is tall for his age .
They &apos;re leaving us .
I need a little time .
It &apos;s dark in this room .
Tom speaks French a little .
I talk to Tom on the phone every day .
What has become of your sister ?
Nobody could &apos;ve known that this was going to happen .
Most girls think that they are pretty .
I &apos;d like you to have it .
Tom isn &apos;t the problem .
That &apos;s not a big problem .
Tom must be sick .
I want to talk to the police .
It &apos;s hard to understand his ideas .
I don &apos;t know whether you like her or not .
My tea is too sweet .
Tom promised to be here by 2 : 30 .
He has no girlfriend .
I don &apos;t think Tom wants to be my friend anymore .
Tom has enough money .
We walked here .
Just leave me alone .
I won &apos;t talk to you .
Tom has few friends .
I &apos;d like to know where you are .
Today is Sunday .
Tom can &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
Tom will drive .
His jokes are not funny at all .
I can &apos;t leave my family .
I thought I asked you to come alone .
Tom tried not to laugh .
Tom felt strong .
He thought that I was very tired .
Some people like to travel alone .
I just want to sleep for a few hours .
Do what I say .
Tom said he &apos;d never leave his wife .
It &apos;s your turn .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do .
He has a lunch .
That would be very sad .
People don &apos;t know how to drive around here .
Her book is very interesting .
Is Tom guilty ?
You have a problem .
He &apos;s not home .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll enjoy studying French with Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t stand .
You need to buy him some new clothes .
That &apos;s all going to change .
I have to go to school .
It &apos;ll rain for sure .
I &apos;ve done things I &apos;m not proud of .
This is how I did it .
Tom couldn &apos;t help .
Can I hold your hand ?
Tom noticed Mary hadn &apos;t even started to cook dinner .
I need to find a new job .
Tom is from Boston , isn &apos;t he ?
When did you buy that ?
Please go to the bench .
I &apos;ll do that later .
It was still there .
Does it really matter ?
Why are you in such a good mood ?
I think it &apos;ll be OK .
She was about to start .
How could Tom be so stupid ?
He smiled at us and got on the train .
I &apos;ll get that .
My brother helped me with my homework .
What time will you arrive tomorrow ?
I didn &apos;t want to talk about Tom .
They have a lot in common .
Get us out of here .
Have you seen Tom &apos;s new apartment ?
I don &apos;t intend to answer any questions .
We have to go by the rules .
These are Tom &apos;s cats .
I &apos;ve got just about everything I need .
I &apos;m talking about you .
I can &apos;t remember everyone .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to cook .
Here &apos;s the plan .
Where is Tom going ?
You &apos;re going to have to do it .
She has a very good voice .
Tom asked me to give this to you .
Where &apos;s the dog ?
Tom and I are giving up .
How long do you plan to stay in this country ?
I think Tom doesn &apos;t really like Mary very much .
Is Tom in Boston ?
This is very important to us .
When can we eat ?
We &apos;ve got each other .
Tom goes shopping almost every morning .
She had no idea what I said .
I do that for Tom .
Tom is the kind of man who knows how to make money .
He did it not for me but for himself .
He always plays well .
You &apos;re Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t tell my mother .
He didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
You should work hard .
She &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
We want meat .
I seldom eat pizza at home .
I &apos;m getting hungry .
He didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
He won &apos;t live much longer .
Is Tom hungry ?
You always were one of my best students .
Where are you going to be ?
It &apos;s a fine day today .
It &apos;s really not a good idea .
I &apos;ll do anything for you .
They saw us yesterday .
Tom wanted to say more .
I &apos;m a doctor .
I really want to know what &apos;s happening here .
Tom got the last piece of cake .
I have to be there .
Tom won &apos;t live long .
Did you tell Tom that ?
I think I &apos;ve made a mistake .
My brother is big enough to travel alone .
Tom and Mary know each other , but they &apos;re not exactly friends .
We &apos;re about to go home .
Where are you going to live ?
Tom said he tried to kiss Mary .
I make a good living .
I think that I have a right to know what &apos;s going on here .
I love my parents .
That tie looks just like the one Tom is wearing .
I like her novel .
We both know what &apos;ll happen if you do that .
Tom loves you .
I hope that you &apos;ll help me .
We like music .
She looks like a boy .
Do your parents speak French ?
Can &apos;t you swim at all ?
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
We &apos;ve lost them .
I will never be your friend .
Do you know why she &apos;s so angry ?
We &apos;ve always been good friends .
The phone doesn &apos;t work right now .
Her father is tall .
I want to ask you some questions about Tom .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .
That &apos;s good news .
He is not too poor to buy a bicycle .
Tom came to my office this morning .
I &apos;m glad Tom is going to help us .
Everything is all right at home .
Do what he says .
Tom said he has to go .
I don &apos;t like the way he talks .
Tom appears satisfied .
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive ?
He does not have to do this .
Who doesn &apos;t think so ?
It &apos;s no longer necessary .
He hit me on the head .
I want to meet Tom .
I decided to study all night long .
Tom was upset because he wasn &apos;t invited to Mary &apos;s party .
Monday &apos;s not good .
Our teacher comes to school by car .
I &apos;ll talk .
I heard it on the news today .
Tom and Mary want to speak to you .
Tom was angry and confused .
The situation has changed .
Tom ran after Mary .
You can &apos;t swim , can you ?
You should talk to someone .
Why does Tom do that ?
Tom certainly knows a lot about Mary .
I &apos;ll stay a few more days .
I &apos;d like to try doing this without your help .
He talks too fast .
I should wash my hair .
I don &apos;t know his address .
She &apos;s completely crazy about him .
I want you and Tom working together on this .
It &apos;s now my turn .
My father works here .
He &apos;s afraid of the sea .
I won &apos;t tell anyone if you won &apos;t .
I &apos;m doing what I have to .
Tom thinks he has found the answer .
You may as well go yourself .
They &apos;re friends .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is at home .
I had a very good time today .
You don &apos;t have a choice .
Thanks for this , Tom .
I want what you want .
Tom is sleeping on the sofa .
Mary broke up with her boyfriend .
Tom bought a camera from Mary .
I speak nothing but the truth .
I don &apos;t want Tom there .
Tom still hasn &apos;t found a good job .
Is there a hospital near here ?
Were you playing tennis yesterday morning ?
I can &apos;t remember when I first met Tom .
We &apos;re very disappointed in you .
I &apos;m home , Tom .
I like a lot of sugar in my coffee .
Tom may be up .
Tom is very busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I can &apos;t believe that .
Why isn &apos;t anyone helping Tom ?
What &apos;s Tom have to do with it ?
That &apos;s absolutely wrong .
Do you think Tom killed himself ?
Tom knew that he couldn &apos;t get to the airport by 2 : 30 .
Why does Tom want to go there ?
Don &apos;t forget to close the door .
She is just a child .
I wonder if Tom knows how to speak French .
Tom can &apos;t stand being around Mary .
You didn &apos;t help Tom do that , did you ?
Did you buy this book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want his son to turn out like me .
It doesn &apos;t make much difference .
How does the song go ?
Tom lost a book .
He really needs your help .
Tom and I are kind of busy right now .
This is better .
I want you to see her .
It &apos;s fun to speak in French .
Where were you today ?
Tom can read .
Tom lives somewhere in Australia .
What did Tom tell Mary not to do ?
These are for you .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to go ?
I knew where to go .
Does your watch keep good time ?
I think it &apos;s Tom .
He did it for fun .
That &apos;s not what Tom is asking .
What have you eaten today ?
When does Tom want to do this ?
Tom is very old .
I would like you to go home with me .
When does the bus leave ?
I don &apos;t often eat out with my family .
Our children like dogs , but I prefer cats .
Tom is going to love Boston .
I &apos;ll be in the library .
What exactly did you do ?
We &apos;re closed .
Why can &apos;t I see you ?
Tom received a letter from Mary .
I let Tom drink some of my beer .
I think we need to go back to Boston .
Do you know what &apos;s happened to Tom ?
Could you please do me a small favor ?
I saw that , too .
I have enough money to buy this book .
I don &apos;t think so .
Come and take a look .
You should do that before it gets too late .
We &apos;ve known each other for more than thirty years .
This is Tom &apos;s bicycle .
She bought him a car .
Is that why you did this ?
We hardly ever agree on anything .
Why didn &apos;t you just say that to Tom ?
I want to come home .
Do you know when Tom &apos;s birthday is ?
You have no other choice .
You should pay for it .
I &apos;ve got nothing .
It &apos;s your problem , not mine .
They are sitting at the table .
I &apos;ve only seen Tom once .
Don &apos;t come .
What &apos;s the point in doing that ?
You &apos;re small .
I &apos;m drinking milk .
Tom told me that he was happy .
Don &apos;t ask me what it was .
She &apos;s still young .
Tom is waiting in front of the school .
Tom is never afraid of anything .
I &apos;ve been doing that for years .
Tom stood still and listened .
I &apos;ll go and have a look .
That &apos;s easy for you to say .
I &apos;m a busy guy .
Tom just couldn &apos;t stop .
He kept us waiting for more than an hour .
Why not come with me ?
He is as tall as my brother .
Are we in danger ?
I haven &apos;t got much money with me .
There &apos;s only room for one of us .
Tom walked Mary home .
Tom is in prison .
I &apos;ve worked here for ten years .
Tom &apos;s going to Boston on Monday .
I &apos;ll be there right away .
Tom told everybody he was able to speak three languages .
I &apos;m as tall as he is .
Tom isn &apos;t the same man he used to be .
Don &apos;t you know her name ?
I can &apos;t believe you did this by yourself .
You cannot be too careful .
Why are you doing all this for us ?
This job will take twice as long as I expected .
She gave him the money .
Tom called Mary a taxi .
There &apos;s a map on the wall .
Tom is very shy .
My father is in good health .
Let me go just once .
Ask again later .
Tom isn &apos;t a student .
I think that car is Tom &apos;s .
He stood there with his hat on .
Tom made rice .
It &apos;s often said that women live longer than men .
I forget who said it .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to eat for dinner .
What &apos;s your son &apos;s name ?
He looks like a horse .
It seems that no one knows the truth .
I don &apos;t want to have children .
We &apos;re so glad to have you here .
I would like to address two questions .
You don &apos;t look like you &apos;re having a good day .
You &apos;ll be in danger .
Tom said that he wasn &apos;t angry .
Tom wants this one .
The shop is closed today .
That &apos;s very , very sad .
I saw some flowers on the table .
Let &apos;s walk .
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days ?
Please tell me your address .
Most people don &apos;t know this .
Her voice sounds very beautiful .
Tom had nothing .
It is clear that we cannot live without air .
Tom is going to love Australia .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
That &apos;s what we do best .
I thought Tom had enough money to live on .
Tom wanted Mary to know .
It &apos;s hard to believe .
That &apos;s my brother .
Where did you get all this from ?
I &apos;d like something to drink .
I got what I wanted .
She looked around her room .
You ought to find nice shoes here .
Tom won &apos;t talk .
It &apos;s ready .
You can go home if you like .
When &apos;s Tom going to get here ?
You must follow the rules .
I have to get ready for work .
Tom still lives at home .
Nobody &apos;s busy .
Did everyone agree ?
I enjoy living in Australia .
There are a lot of people in the park .
Tom likes to talk about golf .
Tom has to come .
There is a map on the wall .
I wish you had let Tom go with us .
Tom isn &apos;t as old as I am .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to school anymore .
Would you like a cup of coffee ?
I &apos;ve finished writing the letter .
I was not sure what to do .
I heard my name called by someone on the street .
She became famous .
I don &apos;t know what Tom thinks .
He looks like his father .
Tom &apos;s joke went over Mary &apos;s head .
Please speak to me in French .
He came home at ten .
Tom didn &apos;t fall .
Tom and Mary decided to get married .
I wonder if Tom would be willing to help me with my homework .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
You &apos;re out of danger .
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that by herself .
He looked young .
Tom has one , too .
Tom asked Mary where the dog was .
I think Tom is in love .
You are sure to succeed , whatever you do .
Tom hasn &apos;t called Mary yet .
Tom got famous very quickly .
Tom has a lot of money .
How many books do you have ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
Why do you have to do that ?
It is nice and warm today .
I want a glass .
You look different today .
I asked Tom for his phone number .
My hands are full right now .
Nobody came to work this morning .
No one was badly injured .
I have no one else to talk to .
Tom realized that he couldn &apos;t play tennis as well as Mary .
You can do whatever you want to .
I think I &apos;ll call Tom .
I have the feeling that my French isn &apos;t getting much better .
That house is small , but it &apos;s big enough for us .
We worry about your future .
I know who was in Tom &apos;s office at 2 : 30 .
Your parents must be so proud of you .
I think Tom isn &apos;t home .
Did Tom tell someone ?
Is that all Tom told you ?
I &apos;ll find out who he is .
They do it each week .
I can &apos;t seem to do anything right .
I prefer to work alone .
I want to stay longer .
I think I can really trust you .
What does Tom say ?
Tom does that quite often .
You should know yourself .
Here &apos;s a piece of paper .
Tom must be dead .
We can &apos;t do this anymore .
How much is this watch ?
Tom took a week off .
I don &apos;t know what I have .
There are people in the park .
I &apos;ve already finished my homework .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary can .
I don &apos;t understand girls at all .
That sofa is less expensive than this table .
If it were not for water , no one could live on earth .
Christmas is soon , right ?
You are going to be OK .
Have another .
How much is this ball ?
They don &apos;t talk to us anymore .
You like doing that , don &apos;t you ?
I want you to come to Boston .
She showed me her room .
Let &apos;s not discuss this now .
You &apos;re never satisfied with anything I do .
The park was full of people .
I love you the way you are .
Tom and Mary spend a lot of time together .
Tom and Mary want to know more about John .
I feel very ill .
Tom wants three of them .
It doesn &apos;t hurt .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it that way .
Did Tom actually do that in less than three hours ?
I will look after the dog .
Tell me what you want me to do .
You make me feel safe .
Tom still hasn &apos;t come back .
Would you care to try ?
I won &apos;t say anything .
Everyone has left except Tom and Mary .
I have nothing to say to you .
Tom slept later than usual .
I don &apos;t agree with you .
I met your girlfriend .
Tom didn &apos;t have enough money to pay the bill .
Why did you do what you did ?
What &apos;s Tom up to tonight ?
They aren &apos;t that good .
I can &apos;t really believe that .
Tom looked Mary in the eyes .
I hope you are all well .
Are you in Boston right now ?
If it were not for your help , I could not run this store .
We expect Tom to come back soon .
People should love each other .
I played tennis yesterday for the first time .
Tom is probably rich .
Most of my friends are guys .
Is Tom a Canadian ?
What I like is her way of talking .
I may never walk again .
It &apos;ll be our secret .
Has Tom really come back ?
I got up early to catch the first train .
My parents are out of town .
He made up his mind .
I want my mom .
You &apos;re busy , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not sure I can afford it .
I can &apos;t do anything for Tom .
All of my children want to go to Australia .
She told him to study .
Tom can &apos;t find what he &apos;s looking for .
Where is my dog ?
Why do you have so many cats ?
What languages does Tom speak ?
Is Tom finished eating ?
Tom isn &apos;t like the other boys .
Don &apos;t leave your things behind .
She is in her hotel now .
This might not have anything to do with our problem .
Tom may be at home .
There is a man waiting for you at the door .
Tom seemed stupid .
I got some money for my birthday .
We &apos;ve all done it .
I &apos;ll pay later .
You can always ask me for help .
I want that report on my desk in one hour .
I &apos;m very upset .
Tom has never been so happy .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
Tom has come home .
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to do that .
How can I help you ?
Could you please help me ?
I don &apos;t know if I should believe Tom or not .
Is the cat all right ?
You have a brother , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t think that Tom did that .
Was it you , Tom ?
Tom couldn &apos;t help thinking about Mary .
I gave him what money I had .
You don &apos;t need to worry about such a thing .
You have to go home .
Do you remember what you were watching ?
I thought you &apos;d quit smoking .
You &apos;ve taken everything .
I couldn &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s likely to take much longer than you think it will .
They &apos;re waiting for you .
When do you eat dinner ?
This doesn &apos;t sound right .
Tom wants us to go with him .
Are we safe now ?
We can open the window .
I was walking in the park with a friend of mine when it started raining .
Who asked you to help ?
Please wait here until he comes .
I think Tom is sleeping .
At your age , you ought to know better .
He &apos;d love to live in the city .
I haven &apos;t heard of him since then .
It is difficult to solve this problem .
She advised him not to drink too much .
I &apos;m not going to go with you .
Tom is with me .
How is it at school ?
My teeth aren &apos;t as white as I &apos;d like them to be .
Is it really all over ?
Are you sure you &apos;re not busy ?
I think it &apos;s very likely that they &apos;ll arrive next week .
Tom returned to his room and closed the door .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s only chance .
It must be pretty cold .
We just don &apos;t notice it anymore .
We &apos;ve decided to visit Boston .
I &apos;m going home .
We always have to pay more .
Do you get enough sleep ?
Let &apos;s ask if it &apos;s true .
You couldn &apos;t solve the problem , could you ?
Where is my umbrella ?
I bought a new pair of glasses .
You can &apos;t both be telling the truth .
I wonder if Tom likes Mary .
I &apos;ll see you this afternoon .
He slept well last night .
That boy said his name was Tom .
I don &apos;t want to hurt her .
My grandfather speaks very slowly .
Are you willing to drive me to the station ?
He &apos;s getting old .
I was disappointed with his speech .
People should do their best .
Tom didn &apos;t win .
This is how Tom did it .
The noise hasn &apos;t stopped all day .
Do you like these ?
They saw Tom .
Tom will take it .
I &apos;ll never tell this to anyone .
I helped them yesterday .
Nobody said you didn &apos;t try your best .
I kept the door locked .
They found us .
There &apos;s still hope .
I don &apos;t like homework .
Tom has many friends .
Why weren &apos;t you able to do that ?
Tom knows what that &apos;s about .
The kids wanted to play .
Why is it dark ?
Tom and Mary were there , too .
They are afraid of death .
Tom probably likes Mary .
Where did you buy that dress ?
I can &apos;t give those to you .
She needs someone who is able to understand her .
What time do you have a break ?
I &apos;m sure that it &apos;ll be fun .
When do you want to do this ?
You know I can &apos;t wait any longer .
Tom does love you .
I &apos;m going in first .
Thanks for being you .
Where exactly did you lose it ?
I have to get a new computer .
I want to be rich .
We can &apos;t stay for dinner .
I &apos;m the only one here who can do that .
I can &apos;t thank you enough .
I know the way .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t go to the movies very often .
I have looked for it up and down .
I want to talk to her .
Tom knows what it is .
Where did you get that hat ?
When was the last time you missed the train ?
Do you want to go ?
I hope you feel at home .
You may go anywhere .
My arm still hurts .
Where did you go ?
I loved it .
That can &apos;t be helped .
Has Tom come ?
Tom didn &apos;t see anybody .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary is supposed to come .
I don &apos;t plan to see Tom till tomorrow .
I &apos;ve never done this before .
There &apos;s nothing going on between Tom and Mary .
May I sit down ?
Tom is very tired .
I never see you without thinking of my father .
She has never been in love .
You &apos;ve already made your decision , haven &apos;t you ?
Why won &apos;t you listen to me ?
Is that you , Tom ?
You &apos;d better not go today .
Tom hates it .
What kind of person does something like that ?
You have to answer the question .
She doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
Who is this guy ?
I like your family .
I want you to come home .
You are not a child any more .
We know you have it .
Are you in love with Tom ?
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t think John did that for Alice .
Is one of you Tom ?
Tom came across the street .
Tom won &apos;t let me drive anymore .
I think that Tom won &apos;t get bored .
We made mistakes .
Tom has a son named John .
Why don &apos;t we go out ?
I think you &apos;re really going to like it .
That is the same color as mine .
Please call me a taxi .
Tom says he &apos;s rich .
We &apos;ve got enough .
Tom can &apos;t help us anymore .
I didn &apos;t know about the party .
He is taller than his father .
How interesting !
I always take the bus .
Tom has decided not to tell Mary about what happened .
Go ahead !
We speak French at home .
We don &apos;t have a single thing to worry about .
Tom went shopping with his girlfriend .
You wanted this to happen , didn &apos;t you ?
What did Tom tell Mary about John ?
They can &apos;t hear me either .
Tom lived in a small apartment by himself .
Did you do your homework ?
I think her name is Mary .
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out .
Tom gave it to us .
He &apos;s studying .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed .
Would you mind if I sat here ?
Tom wasn &apos;t ready to die .
Here they come .
Tom seems nervous .
You can &apos;t swim here .
I wouldn &apos;t want to keep Tom waiting .
It &apos;s new .
Where &apos;s the ice ?
Leave the book where it is .
I can &apos;t think of any place I &apos;d rather be .
I need some help with my homework .
I &apos;ve been waiting all day for you .
We know that Tom is here .
Give that to me , please .
Give him time .
She came into the room .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t eat that .
She found a ball in the garden .
Maybe it &apos;s Tom .
I asked Tom if he would mind doing that .
You can sleep here if you want .
Tom had fun with it .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t tell you that .
I like the way it sounds .
I accept this proposal .
We &apos;re always hungry .
Let &apos;s go somewhere warm .
I don &apos;t have time to take a break .
I &apos;m going to explain it to Tom .
It being Sunday , the shop was closed .
I like it hot .
What &apos;s the sense of working so hard ?
All three of those men are from Boston .
You never can tell what &apos;ll happen in the future .
Do you want him ?
I haven &apos;t seen Tom all day .
We might not need to sell our house .
Tom never wanted to study French .
I helped Tom .
Tom is looking for Mary .
Are you busy now ?
You kids must be tired .
I asked why .
Your life is in danger .
I forgot about that .
Tom said he &apos;ll be there .
My mother is making dinner .
I will be with you right away .
I &apos;ve always wanted to visit another country .
Why don &apos;t you come over after work today ?
You know what needs to be done .
He goes to school by bicycle .
Tom has to be here .
We now know that &apos;s not true .
We &apos;re still thirty minutes away .
He was supposed to go to school .
I don &apos;t understand why Tom has to do that .
Tom is not in .
You &apos;re quiet .
Do you want me to go to Boston with you ?
Tom showed Mary a lot of his pictures .
I have to go out .
I can &apos;t talk to Tom right now .
Tom has been living alone for a long time .
I never want to leave here .
Do you want me to be happy ?
I met him by chance on the train this morning .
Tom and Mary are here .
I study French because I have to .
You &apos;re the only one I have .
I have been to the library .
I don &apos;t understand you .
Can I borrow your pencil ?
You sure can run fast .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that today .
I &apos;m giving you what you want .
I know that Tom has been sick .
Please listen to what I have to say .
I haven &apos;t had much sleep .
Who told you that ?
She looked at me .
We &apos;re getting married .
Mary is going to have another baby .
It &apos;s great to see you &apos;re having so much fun .
Tom and Mary both want to say something .
Tom must &apos;ve been very disappointed .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kissed .
I wish I could have spoken more English .
My mom bought me this shirt .
I &apos;m supposed to talk to Tom .
I don &apos;t like what he said .
Tom says he wants to study French .
I may have told you this story before .
Do you want me to help you find Tom ?
You don &apos;t need to look for it anymore .
He met with an accident .
I &apos;m able to speak .
I think you &apos;ll like this .
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you come ? &quot; &quot; I had no choice . &quot;
She wanted him to take care of her parents .
Tom is very good at French .
Tom has a big house and three cars .
You broke the rules .
Tom sat down next to Mary .
Are they in Paris ?
I don &apos;t understand this country .
Tom has done that on purpose .
If Tom really liked me , he wouldn &apos;t have done that .
I &apos;m so happy for you two .
I think we shouldn &apos;t tell Tom what really happened .
I can &apos;t answer this question .
Maybe you should tell Tom that .
I speak French better than I speak English .
Tom knows us .
Do you speak English ?
Who were you talking with ?
I hid under the table .
You must never forget that .
I don &apos;t want to go outside on a day like this .
Tom ate a lot more than I expected .
I &apos;ll take you with me .
You are not to leave your room .
My passport was stolen .
Tom did what he promised me he &apos;d do .
We must begin before five .
You look like you &apos;re in pain .
What do we have here ?
How much did you bring ?
I walked my dog .
Tom is too young to go there by himself .
The days are getting longer and longer .
He is not Japanese .
I &apos;m very afraid .
Where &apos;s my grandfather ?
Tom is writing a novel now .
What is your opinion on this matter ?
I &apos;ll be with you in a second .
I &apos;m sorry , my father is out .
Tom will be very proud of you .
Tom &apos;s new girlfriend is very young .
You missed your chance .
Tom can drive a car , too .
Give me the gun .
We should probably ask Tom first .
He wants to be different .
I owe you five dollars .
I can &apos;t afford to play tennis .
I don &apos;t think Tom can be left alone .
I want to try to enjoy this .
I never wanted to see Tom again .
Can you call a taxi for me ?
I am reading a book .
Tom is now studying in the library .
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
We should read one book a month at least .
No one is allowed to go there .
He is well known in our country .
Does that make you happy ?
How was your weekend ?
I hate this place .
She took her own life .
I can hardly stand it .
Why do you want it ?
I want you to love me for who I am .
I &apos;ll miss Tom .
Look what I &apos;ve found .
I know exactly what needs to be done .
It &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen Tom .
Tom says this is what he really needs .
Your question is hard to answer .
I met him then for the first time .
Tom never thinks about others .
Tom would like to visit us tomorrow .
I haven &apos;t seen much of him recently .
Where do you stay when you &apos;re in Boston ?
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary .
I didn &apos;t want Tom to leave .
That &apos;s not your cup .
Nothing can stop it .
What &apos;s that got to do with anything ?
Tom is still somewhere in the building , I think .
You have a son named Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ll meet you there in one hour .
You seem to want to know what to do .
You must go at once .
Tom has a lot of money now .
Don &apos;t worry .
That &apos;s it .
What does Tom have on ?
You never should &apos;ve done that .
I &apos;m happy for you two .
What is it like ?
Tom isn &apos;t upset .
We want to take it .
Is Tom in the hospital ?
I think these are yours .
My friends call me Tom .
It won &apos;t help you .
Is Sunday the first day of the week ?
I remember meeting him in Paris .
I know how much you love Tom .
Whose shirt is this ?
I hope to see you tomorrow .
She knows how to play the guitar .
Tom is drinking some water .
That &apos;s OK with me .
He is being very kind today .
Tom isn &apos;t home .
How important are children to you ?
It might be important .
This bicycle is Tom &apos;s .
If it is fine tomorrow , we will play baseball .
Tom has a small garden .
That boy is running .
Who &apos;ll look after your cat while you are away ?
I am afraid I can &apos;t help you .
Why did you tell Tom Mary didn &apos;t like him ?
Do you know Tom well ?
That &apos;s quite a long time .
Tom has been hurt .
We must help Tom .
If I had known your telephone number , I would have called you .
You just have to do as you &apos;re told .
I think that guy looks like Tom .
Nobody knows what has become of him .
Can &apos;t we leave it as it is ?
Don &apos;t do it !
May I have this book ?
I was at the library .
Let &apos;s play tennis after school .
Tom wasn &apos;t fat .
They &apos;re yours .
We arrived home late .
Tom is in his room , writing a letter to his grandmother .
It was white .
I stopped working for Tom three years ago .
I can &apos;t move .
Tom sat down on the desk .
Tom said he &apos;d do that .
Tom is his brother .
He is about my size .
I didn &apos;t study either of the languages .
I must apologize .
I don &apos;t consider Tom a great man .
I go to church every Sunday .
Why is Tom absent ?
Who did you get that from ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go if he doesn &apos;t want to .
Tom is about my size .
Tom has more friends than Mary .
All you can do is wait .
Am I talking to myself ?
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;m going to be able to do that .
Will you please tell me about it ?
Is there anything you can do to help ?
Tom and Mary are getting married next week .
This hat is mine .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home .
Are you Tom &apos;s mother ?
Tom went to visit Mary in the hospital .
Tom looked like he might cry .
The girl said nothing .
I &apos;ve had enough of Tom and Mary .
I &apos;m likely to be here all afternoon .
This car is my father &apos;s .
Tom was kept waiting for a long time .
He doesn &apos;t like eggs .
Tom tried to hide his feelings .
Why didn &apos;t somebody help Tom ?
I love working with Tom .
He made me a suit .
I &apos;m going again tomorrow .
Tom and I were married in October .
This isn &apos;t your house .
We &apos;re university students .
I &apos;ve got some bad news .
I didn &apos;t have anything to drink .
Tom works all night .
Tom was angry .
Tom is in .
This is not true .
Can you tell me what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
You know that I like you .
He did what he promised to do .
Tom won &apos;t make it .
He seems to be sick .
I &apos;m not my father .
Tom is going to be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2 : 30 .
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions now .
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he wants .
This thing isn &apos;t over yet .
Are you happy with your new job ?
I know how busy you are .
Do you want to know who did this ?
I am afraid it &apos;s too late .
I know that money isn &apos;t everything .
We are young .
I eat only when I &apos;m hungry .
He runs .
I used to be fat .
My phone &apos;s stopped working .
How are you now ?
I have to go to the police station .
I come here every day .
Tom isn &apos;t well today .
We &apos;ll give it a shot .
Don &apos;t you remember who gave you that ?
He played baseball after school .
Tom didn &apos;t have any shoes on .
Nothing ever happens here .
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that .
Tom already knows my opinion .
We can &apos;t leave Tom .
All I can do at the moment is wait .
Nothing much has changed .
I &apos;m very happy with my new car .
I &apos;m not saying why .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t speak French .
Have you ever stolen anything ?
Tom may have been there .
I spoke to the boy , who seemed to be older than the girl .
I want you to have it .
Tom has to go to work .
My house is near the post office .
Tom can &apos;t swim as well as Mary can .
I don &apos;t want to tell my girlfriend that .
Tom and Mary have been friends for three years .
They work as hard as ever .
No one knows Tom is here .
Tom was like a father to Mary .
You need this .
He &apos;s not very good at it .
Have you ever been to Boston ?
Do your work in your own way .
I can &apos;t explain everything now .
He &apos;s reading a novel now .
Why are these people in here ?
She put the money in the bank .
I &apos;ll show you what I can do .
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow .
Everybody laughed at the boy .
Since I didn &apos;t know what to do , I asked him for advice .
Everybody knew that Tom didn &apos;t want to visit Boston .
I think my leg is broken .
I don &apos;t intend to do what Tom told me to do .
He looked like a doctor .
It isn &apos;t Christmas yet .
I love him more than any of the other boys .
She decided to marry Tom .
Tom died after his car hit a tree .
There is no solution .
Tom left Mary &apos;s office .
You know me .
Tom should apologize .
I didn &apos;t want Tom at my party .
I haven &apos;t even told Tom .
Tom is about the same age as you are .
Tom called me from Boston .
I don &apos;t think he has anything to do with the matter .
Tom is older than I thought .
Mary likes to wear flowers in her hair .
You know what Tom &apos;s answer is going to be .
You can do it .
She has a big family .
Tom thinks that &apos;s true .
She sat next to me .
My opinion doesn &apos;t really matter .
The vacation is close to an end .
Did I miss anything ?
They &apos;re coming home .
I do it because I enjoy it .
I &apos;d never let you kiss me .
Do you have a bike ?
This is going very well .
Tom is the only one in our family who doesn &apos;t speak French .
I shouldn &apos;t drink .
He came .
You do what you have to do .
My mother isn &apos;t at home .
I don &apos;t eat that much .
We &apos;ve been through this before .
I thought you would come .
Tom stayed strong .
Tom seems to be angry , but not as angry as Mary .
I am busy now .
There is no reason why you shouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
How are we going to get home ?
The dog seems to be sick .
I don &apos;t think that Tom can hear Mary .
Do you want some ice cream ?
I &apos;m quite sure of that .
I found out about it on the news .
I don &apos;t do things like that .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom is .
I have a boyfriend back home .
You have done well .
She never told me she had a cat .
Tom doesn &apos;t eat much .
I want you guys to wait for me .
I thought I &apos;d give Tom your phone number .
He watched the boys swimming .
Where &apos;s it from ?
Someone stole my watch .
You &apos;re going to need these .
Can I see that one ?
I miss Tom . I hope he comes back soon .
He seems to know the secret .
The water &apos;s warm enough for a swim .
He changed his mind .
Do you have any sisters ?
We know them .
Tom didn &apos;t know for certain when Mary was going to arrive .
Tom is just nervous .
How much is it worth to you ?
I became angry .
I can &apos;t get any work done here with all these children in the room .
Tom wanted to know where Mary was .
Tom said he heard Mary &apos;s voice .
Tom helped us .
What do you want to watch ?
Tom went straight home after work .
How old is your uncle ?
I &apos;m so happy to finally be back home .
I know the feeling .
What about his girlfriend ?
What are we doing here ?
My mother has a driver &apos;s license , but she doesn &apos;t drive .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s lawyer .
Why is Tom coming here ?
I &apos;ve given up smoking .
Try harder .
Tom says he needs another computer .
What languages do you speak , Tom ?
I haven &apos;t read his novel , and my brother hasn &apos;t either .
He does not watch TV at all .
It &apos;s just money .
When &apos;s that going to happen ?
Who &apos;s that woman standing over there ?
How much did you pay for it ?
He &apos;s not stupid .
I want Tom to go home .
May I go home now ?
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not a good idea .
Most Japanese eat rice every day .
They helped Tom .
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday .
This is the village where he was born .
It &apos;s a good deal .
You should always keep your word .
I &apos;ve got to get back to Boston .
I &apos;m going to stay home tonight .
You &apos;re not feeling well , are you ?
The boss has a good opinion of your work .
I also have a sister .
You &apos;re making me nervous .
Don &apos;t go in .
Have you ever thought about doing that ?
What makes you think that Tom &apos;s interested in helping us ?
That &apos;s how I see it .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t doing very well .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m really here .
Have you seen my wife ?
That &apos;s a nice car .
My father loves to play the guitar .
We need to know what &apos;s going on .
What does this mean for Tom ?
I &apos;m convinced .
I have a new plan .
I want to try this .
What about Tom ?
I &apos;m tired of Boston .
Give me the salt , please .
My sister is driving me crazy .
Tom should &apos;ve called me .
Many lives were lost .
How long &apos;s Tom been sick ?
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at all .
You &apos;ve got to work really hard .
Tom seems to be expecting something .
Have you finished your work ?
If it weren &apos;t for her help , I would not be alive now .
Let &apos;s leave that matter for later .
At what time will you be leaving ?
Where are my keys ?
I bought this yesterday .
Where &apos;s your hat ?
I hope Tom never gets out of prison .
I saw her play the piano .
It &apos;s so simple .
Tom was afraid of being hurt again .
I was so cold .
Tom had lunch with Mary .
Why can &apos;t I stay with you ?
They lost .
You need to follow the rules .
Where &apos;s your new friend ?
Can life get any better than this ?
Tom knows we can &apos;t speak French very well .
Do you know where Tom has to go ?
That &apos;s my dress .
There is snow on the mountain .
Who is your dad ?
I &apos;m not angry !
I know Tom better than anyone else does .
I wrote a letter .
I don &apos;t know what I want .
I know someone who lives in Boston .
Tell me where I can find Tom .
Don &apos;t break it .
I &apos;m being good to you this morning .
Have you come to save me ?
I know it for a fact .
It &apos;s dangerous to play with fire .
Tom didn &apos;t even help Mary .
I wanted to stay home .
Tom is doing quite well in school .
There isn &apos;t anything down here .
Put that fire out .
If you want to succeed in life , work hard .
He was never to see his parents again .
This is the boy .
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t understand that .
I didn &apos;t expect you .
Look at me when I &apos;m talking to you !
Tom wrote Mary a letter .
It is not far away from the hotel .
He never said it again .
Tom seems young .
Who is this girl ?
I think Tom will be able to help .
That &apos;s a lot of money .
I hate my parents .
You may as well stay where you are .
I hope to see you .
The story was true .
I &apos;m not done with you yet .
Would you please come again later ?
You &apos;re welcome to come with us if you want to .
He stopped smoking because his wife and children asked him to .
I wanted to see if Tom needed any help .
Tom was listening .
Where is your dog ?
I want to spend my life with you .
I want to see that .
It wasn &apos;t that funny .
I was always very close to Tom .
Tom is the one who did this .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston next week .
Where &apos;s my car ?
Our hotel is on the next street .
She was there all morning .
Nobody knows his name .
Tom really should go to Boston .
All these apples are very sweet .
Did you call anyone else ?
One is never too old to learn .
You &apos;ve already decided not to go , haven &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m better than Tom .
Tom sat on a bench reading a book .
I should &apos;ve done this yesterday .
Tom and Mary are mad at John .
My parents have been married since before I was born .
Is that supposed to be a question ?
Don &apos;t you want take a break ?
Tom said Mary is good at French .
No one will find out .
What was Tom &apos;s answer ?
Have you fed the dog yet ?
I don &apos;t know anybody here in this town .
Tom left early to catch the first train .
Have you heard this story already ?
Why can &apos;t Tom come ?
There are hardly any books in this room .
Could you do that for me ?
Is this yours , Tom ?
Tom started off strong .
She didn &apos;t buy bread .
Our teacher speaks French as well as English .
Give Tom what he wants .
She was absent from class .
I wish I were dead .
That &apos;s what I like .
Ask him when the next plane leaves .
French is one of the languages I &apos;ve always wanted to learn .
He doesn &apos;t have a hat on .
Is Tom any better ?
I like cats .
I just want to talk to you .
It has been raining since yesterday .
Could you have done that ?
Do Tom and Mary know why you &apos;re here ?
Tom met Mary .
Tom and Mary live in a small house .
Why wouldn &apos;t you let me go to Tom &apos;s party ?
I love you more than I love her .
Nothing &apos;s going on .
I haven &apos;t told anyone anything .
What does your sister do now ?
I will give you this book .
I made him change his plan .
He is about my age .
He has much more money than I have .
You look stupid .
Why do you need so many shoes ?
Tell Tom to hurry .
She is going to France next week .
I want to be sure .
I don &apos;t know what to say to Tom .
We don &apos;t have another choice .
Do you know when he will come ?
They were hungry .
Tom knew almost everyone there .
I &apos;m rich .
It &apos;s good to have you home .
What Tom said is right .
Tom should arrive in a few minutes .
Tom knew our names .
My father is very angry with me .
You never do anything right , do you ?
I think you &apos;ve convinced Tom .
Will you do that ?
Be quiet and listen to me .
I was planning on telling you today .
Why do I need to be in Boston ?
Tom never would &apos;ve asked .
I understand it , but I still don &apos;t agree with it .
My mother is making a cake .
I will go if I must .
Tom would like Mary to be on his team .
She had the courage to say it .
Have you already decided what to do next Sunday ?
Tom wants to make Mary happy .
I &apos;m sure Tom can &apos;t swim .
She made him cry .
Who wants a piece of cake ?
Tom is well paid for the work he does .
What was Tom doing in your room ?
If I knew the truth , I would tell you .
I &apos;d like to see your sister .
Tom wants you to come home .
They are not sisters .
They don &apos;t like you .
You &apos;ve found it .
What &apos;s that have to do with me ?
I came to say I &apos;m sorry .
I don &apos;t like to do that when it &apos;s raining .
I hope things will turn out well for you .
Tom is a dad , too .
I forgot the book .
That &apos;s one of mine .
Tom probably isn &apos;t watching TV now .
Tom took a picture of Mary .
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;ll go to Boston .
Tom wanted to call Mary .
It will only hurt a little .
Is the job too much for you ?
It &apos;s very hot , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom and Mary both looked sad .
Why do you think Tom doesn &apos;t like me ?
I &apos;m sorry . I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
Mary sounds like her mother .
Tom quite often eats out .
Her face suddenly turned red .
Was the bank closed ?
Tom &apos;ll wait .
Give it to him .
Tom dropped this .
They let me go .
My brother is living in Boston .
Tom has a lot of friends here .
I don &apos;t think she would understand it .
Thank you for seeing us .
Did I say that ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know Mary could speak French .
Thanks for asking .
Don &apos;t worry about it .
I ate with my parents .
I &apos;ll see you in the morning .
I asked him not to drive so fast .
Are you all right ?
Tom hasn &apos;t paid the bill yet .
I &apos;ll call Tom and see what he &apos;s doing .
Tom wanted Mary to look for John .
They should thank me .
He wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
Don &apos;t leave the TV on .
The students are back .
I wish to go abroad .
What &apos;s a picture like that doing in Tom &apos;s room ?
He does not know .
We were just friends .
Tom is at school right now .
I think Tom should go .
How about taking a rest ?
I am looking for my phone .
Tom was sick in bed last Sunday .
She has made the same mistake as last time .
She &apos;s my type .
You won &apos;t be able to handle this job .
I don &apos;t know where you live .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t hear you well .
Please tell me how to get to the bank .
It &apos;s next to impossible to finish it in a day .
I don &apos;t want to know who kissed you .
Please drive carefully .
His story was interesting .
This house is too small to live in .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you . Thank you .
Could you please wait a minute ?
Aren &apos;t you hungry , Tom ?
Tom never really enjoyed doing that .
How can I get to the police station ?
You can cook here .
I did not expect it to be that big .
Some books are worth reading over and over again .
This problem is too hard for me to solve .
We still don &apos;t know the truth .
I stayed with my uncle .
I &apos;m hungry .
There &apos;s no one here by that name .
She can &apos;t bear the noise .
Tom and Mary used to go out together .
I was so disappointed .
Where does he work now ?
Is that the plan ?
I thought something like this might happen .
Did you like the movie ?
We love her , and she loves us , too .
Where &apos;s the car ?
There &apos;s a picture of Tom on the wall .
I accept your offer .
Tom isn &apos;t talking .
Tom is your brother .
Tom looks good for his age .
It began to rain .
Tom is thirty now .
I think this is good for us .
Do you want to see Tom again ?
I &apos;ll do it again .
Tom &apos;s healthy .
Tom was busy all day .
Tom knows how to help people .
Tom and Mary played all afternoon .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember where he put his keys .
How did you get to know that person ?
I have no idea what that is .
If you had told me the truth , I would not be angry now .
He promised to come home early tonight .
Tom &apos;s fast .
Do what your mother says .
You know who Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
He is living in Tokyo .
It &apos;s there .
I feel old .
All the students forgot to read that book .
He didn &apos;t say a word .
He is popular with his men .
I &apos;m coming to you .
Everybody is busy except me .
I &apos;m crazy about you .
I am going to the post office .
That makes me happy .
Tom has no sisters .
I was the only woman .
I know that name .
I thought you of all people would understand my decision .
I &apos;ve waited for more than a week .
This is different from what I thought .
Is it anything like mine ?
Do you want breakfast ?
Tom said he thought the room was too small .
We go to school because we want to learn .
I &apos;ll tell you what I want you to do .
Why did you bring it ?
She told him her age .
I got on the train for London .
You shouldn &apos;t have done it .
I had to change the rules .
Tom didn &apos;t quit .
I &apos;m not a woman .
Maybe I left it on the table .
I don &apos;t know how this works .
I &apos;m sure Tom will win this afternoon .
How stupid of me !
Tom broke his arm .
What are we going to do with it ?
Tom will help us , won &apos;t he ?
I would rather stay here .
He lived there by himself .
Tom isn &apos;t that young .
Tom was the last one to say he &apos;d help .
Tom never wanted to see Mary again .
He is in trouble .
You &apos;re wrong in this case .
I thought Tom lived in Boston .
Tom is the same age as I am .
She is never on time .
You can &apos;t always make everyone happy .
When she heard it , she got very excited .
I don &apos;t know where I &apos;m going .
I don &apos;t have a pencil .
You aren &apos;t rich .
I thought Tom wanted to marry you .
I still don &apos;t believe it !
Give Tom what he needs .
Tom is going to need my help .
Tom has gone to bed .
I &apos;m ready .
You have only three minutes left .
I never drink coffee .
Tom said he didn &apos;t learn anything at school today .
There &apos;s so much I want to say to you .
He has nothing to do .
I don &apos;t feel like studying .
Which country are you from ?
Are those guys from your school ?
It was really good .
Tom refused our help .
Tom had an accident and broke his leg .
My father caught three fish yesterday .
They will be very glad .
Tom was very angry .
I know Tom had nothing to do with that .
They were better than I expected .
I &apos;m just being careful .
I hope that you will like it .
Tom &apos;s drunk .
I was alone .
Everything is over .
Do you want to come over to my house ?
Did you do that ?
I &apos;ll buy that old clock no matter how expensive it is .
Everybody &apos;s worried .
Tom has really been very busy .
I &apos;ve already started to do that .
Come quickly .
She has a small house .
I wasn &apos;t quite sure what to say .
I want to spend time with you .
Tom is Mary &apos;s brother .
What has Tom seen ?
You could &apos;ve answered that question .
There is someone here .
Are you free this weekend ?
Children like playing outside .
I think Tom likes doing that .
There &apos;s not enough water .
Let &apos;s go swimming .
My hands are cold .
Why is Tom out here ?
I don &apos;t worry about Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do with all his money .
Tom wasn &apos;t safe .
I still think about her from time to time .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that Mary really needed to do that .
He promised he would help us .
How are you doing for money ?
He must love you .
I enjoyed talking with him .
I &apos;ll see you around .
My family is very important to me .
Did they understand ?
I could kiss you .
I don &apos;t know how I did that .
May I ask you a question ?
Tom has a new car .
Tom is much older than I thought .
I know each one of you .
Many parents think it &apos;s important for their children to learn how to speak French .
I married off my daughter .
Tom paid me .
Some kids are playing in the park .
This is not my home .
We don &apos;t have this in Europe .
They are eating just now .
They know we &apos;re out here .
We &apos;ll be happy .
You must apologize to Tom .
I missed the point of the joke .
Tom , I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t been completely honest with you .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
I don &apos;t really like to talk about it .
Tom says he &apos;s too tired today to help us .
Not everyone will love you .
Tom taught me a lot .
I &apos;m not here for you .
He &apos;s asleep .
Tom kept me waiting .
I &apos;m very proud of it .
I think you should sit .
He &apos;s already married .
Tom is himself again .
Tom got on the bus .
It doesn &apos;t hurt at all .
We have been good friends for a long time .
Tom has never been married .
I want to talk to you about something else .
Tom and Mary walked to their car .
Tom knows Boston .
My brothers are already married .
She died five years ago .
Tom wanted to learn to swim .
I &apos;ll see what Tom thinks .
I should &apos;ve told you sooner .
How do I do that ?
Take a taxi to the hotel .
Did you see what Tom gave me ?
Tom stayed quiet .
Tom is three years older than Mary .
Tom wanted to meet Mary .
I live in Australia .
I &apos;m not dead .
Where is the post office ?
This sentence is fine .
What &apos;s going on , Tom ?
Tom spoke .
Are these books yours or mine ?
My friends went to the movies without me .
Do you have any questions ?
That &apos;s my dictionary .
Tom died when I was very young .
I never wanted to leave you , but I had no choice .
Tom has worked hard .
He &apos;s the one who told me about that .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re being honest .
Tom left his umbrella on the bus .
Tom now lives in Boston .
Do you think this is too big ?
What do you think Tom is doing ?
They are all very busy .
I don &apos;t know your name .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s true or not .
Where did you catch all those fish ?
Aren &apos;t you going to sing ?
Tom appears to be in a very good mood .
Tom is too old for Mary .
It doesn &apos;t matter what I think .
He has been sick for a long time .
I am in the house .
What do you do in the afternoon ?
I &apos;m going to cook for you .
You have to clean your room .
I have some money with me .
That &apos;ll be difficult .
Tom had never had that problem before .
Tom has already gone home .
Tom and Mary know each other .
Don &apos;t worry . You &apos;ll make it .
I think it &apos;s too early to tell .
There was nobody on the beach .
They never give up .
We must leave this place .
Tom was in a bad mood this morning .
Tom is the only person who can do this job .
That &apos;s for sure .
Tom speaks French as well as you do .
She agreed with my idea .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only one not sitting .
I &apos;m sure that you &apos;ll like it .
Tom isn &apos;t a student here .
I know what I want .
I &apos;d like to have another cup of coffee .
I see that .
There was no answer to my question .
It &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
That was all Tom said .
That won &apos;t help you .
Please tell me what that is .
It &apos;s great to have a family .
Tom can do it better than I can .
How fast does this train run ?
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary .
Let me sleep for ten more minutes .
Tom is so nice .
It is impossible for me to help you .
You &apos;re welcome to write to me .
I have a car .
Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom .
Tom must &apos;ve died .
I agree with your proposal .
Would you like a glass of water ?
I am afraid that it will rain .
Is your room clean ?
She kept on working .
I forgot my wife &apos;s birthday .
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe me at all .
Tom doesn &apos;t let people into his house .
He has a camera .
I &apos;m coming to Boston .
He still has much to learn .
Tom knows he should do it , but he doesn &apos;t want to .
They &apos;re very busy .
I don &apos;t like to think about it .
I don &apos;t worry about you .
Tom doesn &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
You have nothing to lose .
Do you want to eat ?
I &apos;m sorry , Tom , I &apos;ve got to go .
I &apos;d never lend Tom any money .
I &apos;ve always thought you knew how to swim .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary is busy or not .
I won &apos;t need you .
Tom was married .
Why are you mad ?
Mary is as beautiful as ever .
I &apos;m going to church .
Which book do you need ?
They &apos;re waiting for us .
Tom is coming today .
You should &apos;ve kept your mouth shut .
I &apos;m still not sure what you mean by that .
I know the boy standing over there .
I don &apos;t really know why .
Tom had nothing to do with this .
We &apos;ll do it .
Stop saying that .
Do I have to read these ?
The light came on suddenly .
I &apos;m very happy for you .
You know this is a mistake .
We can go anywhere we want .
Give me your shirt .
She isn &apos;t married .
You can ask Tom for help .
Do you think Tom is coming to the party ?
I want to go to school in Australia .
Tom might not be hungry yet .
That house is very small .
The place where he lives is far from town .
Tom lives in Boston with his mother .
Did you find your book ?
We should call the police .
I didn &apos;t understand what you said .
Tom impressed me .
There won &apos;t be a choice .
I &apos;m glad you like it .
I can hardly understand what he says .
He is no longer here .
We can &apos;t help you now .
Tom sat on the couch all alone .
Tom and Mary speak to each other in French .
He is a man of few words .
Tom wanted out .
Tom has a right to know the truth .
Tom has gone crazy .
What do you know about it ?
I just need to know what happened .
I can &apos;t bear living alone .
Tom actually did what he said he would do .
Maybe I should just stay home .
I &apos;m not able to swim .
Come out of there .
Why do you even care about this ?
I &apos;m looking forward to this evening .
I don &apos;t like to drive .
His daughter has become a pretty woman .
I told Tom that I wasn &apos;t busy .
I am eating rice .
This is the first time I &apos;ve seen anything like this .
It &apos;s too late to apologize now .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me .
May I ask you something ?
Can I count on you to do that ?
You know Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I suggested to her that we go to the movies after he came home .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wait for you .
I don &apos;t know what his name is .
Tom will tell you .
Can you see them ?
My father usually goes to his office by bus .
I want you to tell Tom that you don &apos;t love him anymore .
I was born in October .
I just want to let you know that I &apos;ll be late tomorrow morning .
Everybody loves music .
This is how we do it .
We learn a lot from experience .
He tried to sleep on the floor .
I loved you .
I know how to fix this .
I &apos;m not in love with Mary .
I didn &apos;t realize what I was doing .
That &apos;s probably true .
Tom wants a watch like yours .
&quot; Do you speak French ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t . &quot;
Tom had nothing to read .
Tom asked if there was anything he could do .
Why didn &apos;t Tom say anything ?
I think you know what to do .
You may swim .
Tom can &apos;t decide .
I want to play the guitar .
It &apos;s not a dog .
The train is always on time .
There &apos;s no more salt .
Everyone knows about Tom .
I want to start now .
Did you complete the work ?
I &apos;m surprised you came at all .
Tom came to see you .
I know Tom is happy .
What would you do in my place ?
I am pretty sure .
Are you up there ?
I never liked going to school .
I &apos;m angry with her .
Tom is quite poor .
That &apos;s what we saw .
Where are you from , Tom ?
I don &apos;t know where Tom will do that .
I never thought that they would like their teacher so much .
What &apos;s the time now ?
People don &apos;t like what they can &apos;t understand .
I &apos;d like to dance with you .
I want to watch what &apos;s on TV right now .
He never saw his brother again .
Someone gave Tom a car .
We watch TV together .
That &apos;s a church .
He is having lunch .
Tom made a speech .
I must buy one .
I tried it before .
How long did you stay there ?
Tom drove to Mary &apos;s home .
You &apos;d better leave now .
I cannot stand being made fun of .
Tom was the last to arrive .
You &apos;ll like Tom .
I &apos;d like to leave early .
Tom didn &apos;t speak .
Tom thinks he knows what Mary wants .
Why didn &apos;t you do anything ?
Thanks for the help .
If we don &apos;t do that , it won &apos;t get done .
That doesn &apos;t sound too hard .
It doesn &apos;t seem possible , does it ?
Tom seemed nice .
Tom and Mary sat on the bench , watching people swim .
Tom is very glad that school is over .
Was there someone else in the room ?
She &apos;s not the kind of girl you think she is .
Are they coming as well ?
Tom is the only one who knows what &apos;s going on .
Tom finally gave up smoking .
Tom is famous , not only here in Australia , but around the world .
That doesn &apos;t mean anything to me .
He wants a new car .
Tom stayed up late into the night working on his speech .
Tom decided not to stay .
Tom might be early .
I &apos;ll go and get Tom .
We &apos;d better leave her alone .
Tom was born rich .
Don &apos;t say such things .
I want you to leave now .
It was so beautiful .
What &apos;s with Tom ?
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know where Mary is going .
It looks like Tom is in love .
What have you bought your girlfriend for Christmas ?
Tom is still waiting outside .
How long does it take to walk from here to the station ?
Tom was finished .
He &apos;ll answer your letter soon .
May I begin ?
They &apos;re not coming .
I had so much fun doing that .
Come into the room .
What did Tom feed the dog ?
We have to do that before Monday .
Tom is now on his own , isn &apos;t he ?
This is love .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want to help Mary ?
I found this in Tom &apos;s room .
She can &apos;t stop me .
I invited them to the party .
I &apos;ll leave you alone now .
I heard that Tom has left his wife .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom can only get better .
I wasn &apos;t lying when I said that I loved you .
The truth will come out in the future .
Tom is watching TV in his room .
I &apos;ve never been to Europe .
That &apos;s not what I said .
He did not eat anything yesterday .
What Tom really wanted was a good friend he could talk to .
They found this .
Has he come yet ?
Tom got in his car and went home .
I heard him sing a song .
He &apos;s never told a lie .
They &apos;ll never find you here .
I saw him there .
I can &apos;t tell you what happened .
I was quite surprised .
I knew what I was supposed to do .
Does he like his job ?
Where do you want to go tomorrow ?
I &apos;m going to go .
I have work for Tom .
I am full of doubt .
Tom does it all the time .
He &apos;s already too far away to hear us .
You must work .
It is a little cold .
Tom is also from Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
I thought we did a good job .
He said he would write to me , but he hasn &apos;t .
Tom was late again this morning .
It looks like Tom is done .
I &apos;ll go get my car .
Tom enjoyed it .
What does she think about my car ?
I &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here .
Why doesn &apos;t that surprise me ?
Do you think we &apos;ll win ?
You never should &apos;ve left your husband .
I &apos;ll play tennis this afternoon .
Why would you do something like that ?
How &apos;s your little sister ?
Tom can &apos;t understand French .
Tom isn &apos;t ready .
I eat only what I want to eat .
You &apos;re just like your father .
How well can you play tennis ?
I caught three fish today .
Don &apos;t be afraid .
I think we have to go .
I thought Tom would be too busy to help us .
I don &apos;t enjoy studying French .
What do you want to do in Boston ?
I haven &apos;t heard from him since then .
You &apos;re pretty .
Tom goes abroad almost every year .
What are we going to do about this ?
He hadn &apos;t eaten in two days .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t know .
What am I supposed to say ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to go to the doctor .
I really wasn &apos;t expecting that from you .
I got no answer .
Tom was rather impressed .
The man took the boy by the hand .
How did Tom know that Mary would be here ?
They may leave tomorrow .
Tom and Mary never did like each other much .
Tom is faster than you think .
I &apos;m not over thirty years old .
He is younger than me by three years .
How should I know ?
Maybe they should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
When I hear that song , I think about when I was young .
I remember how he used to be .
I phone him every day .
Is there something I could get you ?
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston .
Can you come back later ?
Tom isn &apos;t with us .
Give those to Tom .
You &apos;ll be missed by your friends when you &apos;re gone .
I was really scared .
I can teach you things .
What is love ?
She lost a book .
We &apos;re not finished yet .
I should &apos;ve kept my mouth shut .
Tom told Mary that Alice wasn &apos;t his girlfriend anymore .
Tom is good to me .
What do you think is the best way to get to Tom &apos;s house from here ?
Tom is never on time .
I don &apos;t want you to think I &apos;m crazy .
I want to know what you &apos;ll do .
Tell Tom what to do .
Who &apos;ll start ?
Tom lives near the beach .
The doctor advised him to cut down on drinking .
I need this more than you do .
I bought this book as a gift for Tom .
Tom has decided against doing that .
It is clear what must be done .
I &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking about what you said .
Tom wants a new car .
How long have you had this problem ?
How badly do you want it ?
The book fell to the floor .
Tom is still married .
You &apos;d love it .
We can &apos;t be too careful .
Nothing comes from nothing .
We all work .
They say it &apos;s very good .
If I were you , I &apos;d go home right away .
Don &apos;t speak so fast , please .
I brought you something .
I couldn &apos;t have done this without your help .
Tom lost his voice .
She waited for you for two hours .
I don &apos;t mind if it &apos;s hot .
Tom is at the airport .
No one knows where he lives .
I couldn &apos;t get him to do it .
The door opened and a man came in .
You &apos;re busy all the time .
I &apos;ve read both these books .
That &apos;s the book I told you about .
Tom says he &apos;s studying French .
Do you know how dangerous that is ?
Let &apos;s call it a night .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to work late .
I need to know before 2 : 30 .
Why is Tom so scared ?
I only need Tom .
I found it on the street .
You &apos;re not going to like this .
I won &apos;t see him anymore .
I &apos;m going to drive myself .
I want to go home .
Is Tom that good ?
Tom is in the car .
What do you think about that ?
I know who he is .
I know Tom &apos;s in love with Mary .
She is likely to come .
Do you know this man in the picture ?
It &apos;s totally different .
Tom is too young to be doing that .
Do you have a family ?
Where &apos;s our money ?
There &apos;s too much sugar in the coffee .
Tom is drinking tea .
Tom doesn &apos;t realize how lucky he is .
Tom looked at Mary and so did John .
How &apos;s your French ?
There is a bank in front of the station .
His brother passed away last month .
Aren &apos;t you going to vote today ?
You are late . The meeting finished thirty minutes ago .
Did Tom arrive on time ?
How &apos;s my wife doing ?
I think I &apos;ll go and get Tom .
It &apos;s just too soon .
He was waiting for a long time .
I was surprised to see you here .
You don &apos;t have to go there .
What &apos;s going on with Tom ?
I really want to see Tom today .
Let &apos;s visit Tom .
I don &apos;t think he is right .
That &apos;s not the way it happened at all .
Tom has a lot of friends .
Where does Tom go to school ?
If we &apos;re going to do this , let &apos;s do it right .
Where do you come from ?
My bicycle was stolen .
You and I have something in common .
I wouldn &apos;t count on it .
I need Tom &apos;s help .
He &apos;s just arrived .
Tom wants our help .
Did you live here ?
Tom may have told Mary about it .
Tom came too early .
These belong to Tom .
Do you know Tom &apos;s parents ?
What kind of ship is that ?
We need this report by tomorrow .
Would you like some ?
I know that she is beautiful .
I &apos;m the same age as Tom .
Tom told Mary that he didn &apos;t think Alice was cute .
Are you sure of that ?
How did he find us ?
We know why .
I don &apos;t know what I should &apos;ve done .
Why don &apos;t I take Tom ?
How do you like it here ?
I &apos;m not giving up on you .
Why don &apos;t you go and see ?
Tom won &apos;t be here until later .
Tom lost interest in his job .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;ll do .
Is there a woman in your life ?
His plan is dangerous !
I didn &apos;t ask Tom to wait for me .
I made you coffee .
Aren &apos;t you from Australia ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he wants .
Whose beer is this ?
What do you want from me ?
I have not finished breakfast yet .
That &apos;s his house .
I want to hear more about Tom .
It wasn &apos;t enough .
Do not do that .
Her hands are small , but not so small that she can &apos;t play the piano .
Everyone is tired .
Who speaks French ?
I don &apos;t want to die .
I went there to meet him .
If you want something done right , you have to do it yourself .
She has a little bread .
I met Tom in the park .
My father gave me a watch , but I lost it .
Nobody likes her .
Why didn &apos;t you come to yesterday &apos;s party ?
We were lucky .
Who will you be coming with ?
I think Tom is afraid of your dog .
I &apos;ll tell Tom you asked .
Where did you get the idea that I don &apos;t like Tom ?
You &apos;re not too old to do that .
Can you give me some money ?
We know what to do .
What are Tom and Mary doing here ?
You ought to have told me that before .
I &apos;m looking for one of my sisters .
I used to love her , but not anymore .
Everyone needs friends .
Tom won &apos;t pass the test .
Don &apos;t be late for work .
Who are you talking about ?
Tom and Mary fight with each other all the time .
We have been here for two days .
What does Tom want to know ?
You speak French very well .
Let me know if there is anything I can do .
I asked Tom where he &apos;d gone .
I have to go ask Tom .
Tom seemed to enjoy it .
That &apos;s going to happen .
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week .
That sounds interesting .
Tom and I never quite saw eye to eye .
You shouldn &apos;t lend Tom any money .
Tom thought Mary was busy .
Do you know this song ?
There is no hope of success .
When are you coming home ?
It &apos;s too expensive .
This isn &apos;t working .
Has anyone ever told you that you &apos;re beautiful ?
Tom picked up the book and started reading .
We became best friends .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ?
It is easy to read this book .
Tom seems serious .
He was able to read the book .
I went to the park yesterday .
People often fall asleep while reading .
How hot is it where you are ?
I haven &apos;t finished breakfast yet .
They are not at all interested .
This has to stop .
We &apos;re not done yet .
Tom is gone .
Is Mary Tom &apos;s mother ?
I don &apos;t like the name Tom .
Take me there .
I think Tom could learn a lot from you .
Tom felt hungry .
I don &apos;t like that name .
Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
How long do you want to stay in Boston ?
Tom and his friends are playing soccer in the park .
Tom and Mary talked all afternoon .
Our problems are far from over .
I wanted to do something for Tom .
Tom sat on the bench next to Mary .
Can I eat in my room ?
When was the last time you went to Boston ?
What makes you think I like you ?
He is reading .
Tell Tom I don &apos;t have his keys .
Tom bought us some drinks .
Tom bought a new car yesterday .
I wish I didn &apos;t have so many problems .
I &apos;m sure this will happen again .
I have seen her before .
All I have is one book .
Tom laughed .
You promised to help .
Please turn off the television .
I see you &apos;ve been shopping again .
You should wash your car .
We ran out of food .
We know what Tom and Mary want .
The house was empty except for a cat .
Now pay attention .
Tom knows exactly what he needs to do .
I know what you said .
Tom &apos;s mother is a very good cook .
I have something for you .
I went to school there .
It &apos;s not necessary to come tomorrow .
She got angry .
That &apos;s not my opinion .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve kept you waiting so long .
He likes coffee without sugar .
I know Tom likes you .
I &apos;ve never hit anyone .
Tom tried to help .
Tom and I got married in Australia three years ago .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
It may be important .
You &apos;ve hardly changed .
I did nothing all day .
I like the beach .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember anything .
I know this must be very difficult for you .
I &apos;m glad you are all here .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything for the past three days .
I &apos;m going to see Tom .
She was young .
Tom came outside .
They &apos;ll come to us .
We have changed .
I told my parents everything .
I don &apos;t watch much TV .
He will always be with you .
I called him .
You &apos;re very kind , Tom .
Your opinion is quite different from mine .
Tom &apos;s helping .
English is not spoken here .
She was wearing a new hat .
I saw the movie .
Call me tomorrow .
Tom has lost his new umbrella .
I wish Tom would learn to speak French .
It isn &apos;t likely Tom did that on purpose .
Tom broke his leg .
He will play tennis with his friends .
I want everyone to show me his or her driver &apos;s license .
Tom will call me .
I had no idea what I should write .
Have you ever seen Tom eat ?
I don &apos;t know what to think .
It started to rain .
I just need to find out why .
Tom usually takes a bus to work .
I don &apos;t see why not .
It &apos;s only a matter of time .
There &apos;s no way to save everybody .
My brother works in France .
Why do you want to know what I &apos;m thinking ?
How did you meet your wife ?
I love jokes .
Don &apos;t look up .
I can do it by myself !
You &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t you ?
I want him to leave .
We &apos;re getting better and better .
I can &apos;t tell Tom that .
Why aren &apos;t you in there ?
Tom has to help Mary .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s house for dinner .
Do come by all means .
He eats nothing other than fruit .
There was hardly anyone in the room .
Tom looks just like me .
My children won &apos;t eat fish .
What kind of dog is that ?
I may not come .
Tom looks as though he wants to cry .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe anything Mary says .
I don &apos;t remember being given a choice .
Thank you for your advice .
All the girls love Tom .
This is a picture of the airport .
You &apos;re too good to me .
Tom refused to pay the bill .
I hate children .
I &apos;m not ready to be a mother .
He will write an answer very soon .
We know you like Tom .
They took off after Tom .
I &apos;m not sure how that happened .
You know how important you are to me .
Do you want to see it again ?
What &apos;ll Tom be doing in Boston ?
Tom liked it immediately .
I already said I don &apos;t know how to do that .
Tom didn &apos;t have any other choice .
You may ask any questions you want .
They &apos;re yours , Tom .
What does Tom have to do with this ?
I wonder if the weather will hold .
Is it always like this ?
I &apos;m so cold .
Everyone &apos;s dead .
Tom is kind of cute .
This time I &apos;ll try it .
Tom won &apos;t be able to do it by himself , so we need to ask someone to help him .
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
It was very hard .
I didn &apos;t want to see Tom again .
I &apos;ve thought about you a lot .
I should apologize to Tom .
He doesn &apos;t take care of his children .
I said everything I had to say .
I know why you &apos;re doing this .
That news got around .
Tom said he &apos;ll look after me .
It didn &apos;t surprise me at all that Tom couldn &apos;t afford a lawyer .
Mary was beautiful .
It shouldn &apos;t be too difficult to do that .
Tom can &apos;t do it .
Tom broke that one .
If we begin early , we can finish by lunch .
Tom listened for a moment .
I &apos;ll live .
I &apos;m not exactly surprised .
Tom and Mary know about it .
You are telling it second hand , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom won &apos;t get here until 2 : 30 .
I could do it again .
You know what Tom wants .
It didn &apos;t surprise me at all that Tom didn &apos;t do what he &apos;d told Mary he was going to do .
I know about you and Tom .
We need to stop Tom before he hurts himself .
How long have you waited ?
Tom knew what to say .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Tom does know that .
I &apos;ve found something I &apos;d like to show you .
I was not drunk .
Can I say something now ?
I &apos;m almost done here .
You may see Tom there .
Tom did it for fun .
He doesn &apos;t have a computer .
Would you like to go out with me tonight ?
Tom is often absent from school .
Do we have time ?
I &apos;m asking what you think .
Tom is with her .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t plan to go by himself .
I &apos;m going to bed early tonight .
What have you been doing all week ?
How did you guys find me ?
It is up to us to help those people .
I think it &apos;s a good idea .
You &apos;ve spoken with Tom since I have , haven &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t look into the box .
Tom didn &apos;t say a word .
I drove Tom to school .
Didn &apos;t you hear her speaking French ?
We can &apos;t be sure , can we ?
Nobody knows where he has gone .
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow .
I am not the person I used to be .
What would happen ?
I &apos;m probably not the only one here who can &apos;t do that .
I wish you could stay the night .
Tom usually goes to school by bicycle .
I have a lot more homework than Tom does .
I &apos;m sorry about that .
Tom says that he &apos;s not interested in doing that .
After you &apos;ve eaten , you should get some sleep .
I knew your brother .
This question is too difficult for me .
Tom isn &apos;t my type at all .
He did it himself .
She knows what you did .
Tom doesn &apos;t need money to have a good time .
Here &apos;s your dog .
Tom is the only one who saw what happened .
It was nice meeting you here .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe it .
We were right .
Tom must &apos;ve left .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to do what he wanted to do .
Do you think Tom will actually help us ?
Tom and I often work together .
There is a right time for everything .
That door won &apos;t open .
It was only a joke .
Don &apos;t say his name .
Tom was probably born in Australia .
Where do you want to eat ?
Where did you buy your car ?
I don &apos;t hate Tom anymore .
We could not see anyone in the street .
I have a dictionary .
The baby smiled at me .
I plan to speak with Tom about that .
Tom watched Mary work .
I &apos;ve come to take what &apos;s mine .
He ran across the street , leaving her alone .
I know how hard this must be .
I don &apos;t feel like doing it .
Please tell Tom .
I know what you mean .
He said that everything would turn out well .
Tom made the right choice .
We &apos;re lucky Tom isn &apos;t here with us .
I can &apos;t read Tom &apos;s mind .
Tom started studying French last year .
I can &apos;t leave until I find out who Tom is .
He started washing his car .
I have a wife and kids .
I gave him my phone number .
I &apos;ve thought of that .
Tom won &apos;t likely sleep very well tonight .
I don &apos;t like to speak in front of people .
What would you do if you were in my place ?
We have to stop it .
I &apos;m sad and lonely .
What did you do with my book ?
It seems to me that you &apos;re making fun of me .
I &apos;m going to be a father .
Tom must be a good teacher .
Tom is not welcome in this house .
They &apos;re early .
You ought to listen to your mother .
Nothing is perfect .
I &apos;ll give you an answer in a day or two .
He likes soccer .
I never realized how hard it must be to be a woman .
I wanted this .
Do you want a little cake ?
The car pulled up in front of the bank .
I don &apos;t like your dog .
Tom walked through the kitchen .
I already knew this .
What else does Tom have ?
Tom rarely goes out .
I could swim well even when I was a boy .
The weather has a great deal to do with our health .
I think I &apos;ve got it .
Nothing ever happens around here .
I &apos;m going to the post office .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston with you .
It &apos;s not my problem .
Tom lived in Boston for many years .
I can &apos;t tell her now . It &apos;s not that simple anymore .
I &apos;d be up for that .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t laughing anymore .
Tom is much younger than Mary .
They do that faster than Tom .
Tom is back in Boston .
I &apos;m studying French now .
I &apos;m likely to do that soon .
What I need is more time .
Do you mind if I ask why ?
What do you think I &apos;m doing ?
We have everything here that we need .
Tom said that he would come .
I &apos;ll sleep here .
I don &apos;t know what they are doing .
Do you think I don &apos;t know what you did ?
I &apos;m so proud to know that she &apos;s mine .
Did you invite Tom to dinner ?
Please stop talking .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Boston yet .
When did Tom get married ?
I &apos;m here to apologize .
I waited an hour for my friend .
You all remember Tom , don &apos;t you ?
You know I can &apos;t wait for you if you &apos;re late .
I don &apos;t know how to use this .
I don &apos;t know much about you .
I almost never listen to the radio .
Did Tom forget to pay ?
Please don &apos;t bother .
Keep an eye on Tom .
Tom &apos;s convinced .
My English is anything but good .
I went to Boston last year .
I bought the same camera as you have .
I don &apos;t want to make the same mistakes over again .
Tom took off his watch .
He doesn &apos;t seem to be an American .
What &apos;re you doing up here ?
We &apos;re going to do it again .
Don &apos;t ask me that again .
I liked the movie .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re crazy .
They are disappointed in their son .
Tom will be back in a second .
We can &apos;t save everyone .
What &apos;s wrong with Tom today ?
This work is anything but easy .
Tom felt all alone .
There are some books on Tom &apos;s desk .
I can &apos;t speak French at all .
Where should we stay in Boston ?
I &apos;ll drive you somewhere .
Do you enjoy working from home ?
What did his wife say ?
I can &apos;t understand this word .
When will you be back ?
I &apos;m sorry Tom isn &apos;t here .
I know my way around Australia .
You aren &apos;t likely to find that word in a dictionary that &apos;s this small .
Your time is up .
I read a book as I walked .
The bus is full . You &apos;ll have to wait for the next one .
I have to open my shop .
When are you going to Europe ?
All three of these are Tom &apos;s .
What do you think has become of him ?
I don &apos;t want to think about death .
We &apos;ll find them .
Is it hard to learn French ?
If Tom didn &apos;t kill Mary , then who did ?
It wasn &apos;t important to me .
He doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Come with me now .
Do you want me to wait ?
You &apos;ve done this before , haven &apos;t you ?
Do you want to come ?
Why should I apologize ?
We didn &apos;t play well .
Do come in .
Who &apos;s with Tom ?
I &apos;m sick of fish .
Tom is busy right now .
You and Tom must be so happy .
I thought I knew what to do .
I meant to call you .
I &apos;ll stay .
Everybody wants to be here .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was going to be fired .
How was your day today ?
They &apos;ll like that .
This is my kitchen .
Would someone tell me what &apos;s going on ?
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t like you .
I have to quit smoking .
I went swimming in the river yesterday .
Tom said that he needed some money .
These are very old books .
Have you called him yet ?
Tom likes to do that here .
I left my wife .
This is my umbrella .
I don &apos;t like what I see .
I think you know everyone here .
That &apos;s exactly what we need .
What time do you think you &apos;ll likely arrive ?
He cannot have done such a thing .
You &apos;re not my brother .
Tom won &apos;t come , and Mary won &apos;t either .
It &apos;s not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help .
Did you vote ?
Why do you want to know that ?
Tom showed us around the city .
You &apos;ve got to believe me .
How come you know English so well ?
I don &apos;t need to do that as often as I used to .
I know how many of them there are .
You should leave .
I think that Tom was born in Australia .
No one &apos;s home .
I &apos;ll be waiting over there .
Tom said you wouldn &apos;t go .
I know a man who can help .
I thought you were going to ask us to leave .
I &apos;ll be back as soon as I find Tom .
There &apos;s no reason for you to apologize .
Tom got off the train .
Look at the girls .
She wants to work in a hospital .
Can I have some more milk ?
The world is full of problems .
I missed my train .
I &apos;m very busy .
Are those flowers for me ?
This won &apos;t end well .
What does everybody else think ?
Tom drank from my cup .
Tom lived in Boston for three years .
I &apos;m very disappointed .
Are you busy these days ?
Please give me something to eat .
One who has everything can lose everything .
How did you get to know him ?
I ran outside .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
What kind of food do you usually eat ?
Tom said that he was too busy to help Mary do that .
It &apos;ll rain soon .
We know Tom can &apos;t speak French very well .
The paper didn &apos;t carry the story .
How did you get into the house ?
This is good for us .
Do you want to do it right now ?
Call me at the office .
This isn &apos;t sugar .
Is there something we can do for you ?
I thought you wanted to wait .
Where are Tom and Mary ?
I &apos;ll miss you very much if you go .
Tom and Mary were often seen together .
These books are very old .
She cannot have told a lie .
I have been expecting you .
I guess I should &apos;ve done more .
I love his son .
Go to Tom &apos;s house .
I can &apos;t wait .
I wonder what happened to Tom .
I am going to see him today .
I &apos;m losing .
Tom was able to buy what he needed .
I was just about to say that .
It was a bad movie .
I want you all to stay with me .
I had fish for dinner last night .
Tom likes that one .
I enjoyed it , too .
What is it , Tom ? What &apos;s wrong ?
Tom may do whatever he wants to .
She appears to have a lot of friends .
Do you think he did the job on his own ?
You know it better than anyone else .
I wonder what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
Was that your plan ?
That was the plan .
You may be right .
I have one of those .
I was looking for Tom , but he found me first .
Why is this so expensive ?
Why are you doing it ?
Does Tom have to do this ?
We &apos;ve found Tom .
How could we have been so stupid ?
She hit the ball hard .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was fat .
You know that I don &apos;t like eggs .
Where did you find my umbrella ?
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can .
Tom started learning French last year .
You don &apos;t need to go .
It isn &apos;t good .
You can count on him .
I &apos;d never ever do that .
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat .
I &apos;d like you to meet my brother , Tom .
You shouldn &apos;t go to work .
I &apos;ve got to speak to Tom .
I live in the country .
There &apos;s a pencil on my desk you can use .
You are really very good .
Thanks for doing that for Tom .
Tom was taken to the hospital .
Tom said he was glad that he did that .
This problem is difficult for me to solve .
Tom used to enjoy eating out .
What are you doing down there ?
It could be a big problem .
How long has it been since you &apos;ve been to Australia ?
My sight isn &apos;t as good as it used to be .
I thought you might want a drink .
You are stupid .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m not hungry .
Has anyone ever broken your heart ?
Tom left without saying a word .
Come again .
Do you have paper ?
He had barely enough to eat .
I have to go with Tom .
Let &apos;s do that first .
Tom shouldn &apos;t leave early again .
I take a taxi to the train station once or twice a week .
They don &apos;t know what they are missing .
How much is an apple ?
I visited him in the hospital .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary should do that .
Are you students at this school ?
I hope Tom likes me .
I don &apos;t want to go to bed yet .
Did you understand what he meant ?
He isn &apos;t happy at all .
Tom is old enough to decide for himself .
I knew Tom a lot better than you did .
This is very kind of you .
Are you famous ?
What are you doing here , Tom ? Mary doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I love Tom &apos;s car .
It doesn &apos;t make Tom happy .
Tom convinced me to stay .
Did Tom drive to Boston by himself ?
It &apos;s dangerous to swim in this river .
I almost never met her .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t injured .
I haven &apos;t decided yet .
Tom talked to Mary as well .
Look , I &apos;m not doing this .
What do you want to do with this ?
I called him this morning .
Please put the table next to the wall .
Tom didn &apos;t help much .
The children are gone .
Don &apos;t admit anything .
He often drives his father &apos;s car .
You &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s so bad , it &apos;s funny .
It &apos;s more than enough .
Tom is a good student .
She lost both her parents .
I was ready for Tom .
Tom is home alone .
Who do you think you &apos;re talking to here ?
Tom died very young .
I was surprised when Tom told me why he needed to do that .
When are you coming back ?
Tom came over yesterday with one of his friends .
That &apos;s our fault .
I don &apos;t drink much wine .
I &apos;ll be right behind you .
I believe his name is Tom .
I like the way you talk .
Are they coming at six or at seven ?
Tom worked hard writing his speech .
What do you like to read ?
Tom is studying .
Come and see me once in a while .
I was a student at that time .
You &apos;re not very hungry , are you ?
He can &apos;t afford to get married .
She knew the story already .
It &apos;s the truth .
We &apos;re hot .
I don &apos;t have a wife .
Tom isn &apos;t running .
They all looked happy .
Would you sing us a song in English ?
We &apos;ll be leaving now .
You &apos;re almost as old as I am .
He doesn &apos;t have any children .
I fell asleep .
He was sick , but he went to school .
Boston is my home now .
Didn &apos;t he tell you who he was ?
I love my mother .
He &apos;s in my class .
My father suggested that we go to the movies this afternoon .
He is good at golf .
Tom is younger than Mary .
How many people are there in this office ?
I received your message .
You are important .
We must be as kind to old people as possible .
I &apos;d do anything for you , Tom .
Tom was injured in the accident .
I can &apos;t tell you the answer to that yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t play golf so much anymore .
Tom is likely to be right .
Now that we &apos;ve finished eating , let &apos;s go .
Tell the truth .
I wish that were true .
He is the father of three children .
I speak English a lot .
Did you get anything from Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have a dad .
Mary looks just like her mother .
I asked Tom where he &apos;d been .
Leave that alone .
I didn &apos;t think you even liked me .
What &apos;s the name of this river ?
You will come to like this kind of music .
We know it was you that took Tom &apos;s umbrella .
Tom wants to know the truth .
That &apos;ll put you in danger .
I could barely speak French three years ago .
Don &apos;t you ever come back .
Tell us how you did it .
It &apos;s not easy being married to Tom .
You can stay as long as you like .
I want to know how Tom died .
You heard what Tom said , didn &apos;t you ?
We ate together at the table in the small kitchen .
Tom and Mary have what they want .
They &apos;re impressed .
I ran into an old friend of mine outside the station .
You never should &apos;ve let Tom go to Boston with Mary .
Tom isn &apos;t finished yet .
Where did you get this ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard that word in a long time .
I can &apos;t understand Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to be able to work tomorrow .
Are you from Boston ?
Could I have some of your beer ?
I was trying to find Tom .
We can begin tonight .
His mother died four years later .
You will see the difference .
Please come as soon as possible .
He only speaks one language .
It &apos;s not as bad as it seems .
Tom said that nothing had happened .
I don &apos;t like a world where things change so slowly .
Tom has made the same mistake twice .
We make a great team .
Tom needed the money .
Tom told Mary to do that .
I didn &apos;t mean to cry .
I &apos;ll call you back in about thirty minutes .
Tom always speaks French .
What I want to know is how Tom got here .
We drove to Boston last Monday .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a big deal .
I am very hungry .
Tom had never seen Mary so upset before .
It &apos;s a problem .
I know Tom loves Mary .
Tom let Mary play his guitar .
How do you know about that ?
I can &apos;t find my suitcase .
I don &apos;t even know your real name .
Today you can eat as much as you want .
He began a new life .
Tom looks like a woman .
Please be honest .
It &apos;s all I have .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come to my office .
Tom did it very well .
Why don &apos;t you understand ?
He could do it .
My grandmother can fly .
Isn &apos;t that Tom ?
My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English .
I &apos;m giving up smoking .
We get on OK .
I think that &apos;s what it is .
French is difficult to learn .
Tom refused .
Why do you think I &apos;m thinking about you ?
I met an old friend of mine .
Would you like a cup of milk ?
You can &apos;t help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day .
Can Tom ride a bicycle ?
I told you that I wasn &apos;t going to give up .
I like reading .
I think you know why .
I go to school with Tom .
Where are my books ?
I hid it under my bed .
I drove Tom to the hospital .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is saying what she really thinks .
Tom wants more .
I &apos;m ready when you are .
Tom came after you left .
I &apos;m not going to sell it .
&quot; Where &apos;s his book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
I guess I &apos;d better leave .
Tom wants to know your name .
I think Tom is getting ready .
What &apos;s wrong with me ?
I &apos;m thinking about something else .
I did my homework yesterday .
My horse likes apples .
Children like playing more than studying .
Tom knew where Mary wanted to live .
I think they did that on purpose .
I never thought I &apos;d say this .
What is he looking for ?
I &apos;m worried about what &apos;ll happen if Tom doesn &apos;t come .
Tom can &apos;t do everything by himself .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to know who gave this to us .
The morning was clear .
Tom wants to play .
Have you ever seen anything like this ?
Tom may do whatever he wants .
I want him to go there .
She &apos;s sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t speaking to each other .
I have to cook dinner today .
I have to visit Tom .
All three of you need to do that .
I forgot that Tom didn &apos;t speak French .
&quot; Which apple would you like ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like that one . &quot;
They can &apos;t stop me .
Tom helped Mary in the kitchen .
We became good friends .
I &apos;ve been in Australia for over a year .
He is tired of reading .
Tom died trying to save Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t know when he &apos;d be back .
I know what they &apos;re going to do .
Tom says he &apos;s planning to go to Boston this winter .
This bag is mine .
I cannot read French .
It &apos;s as good as finished .
He &apos;s scared to talk to me .
It wasn &apos;t necessary for you to do that .
He has one dog and six cats .
Please close the door .
I didn &apos;t mind doing that at all .
Don &apos;t give me that look .
The mail has arrived .
Tom has learned a lot about Australia from Mary .
Mary is just as beautiful as Alice , I think .
Just water , please .
She won &apos;t be pleased .
I &apos;m working as fast as I can .
I was worried about you all day .
Tom doesn &apos;t drive as fast as Mary .
I have a pain in my foot .
I can &apos;t buy a car .
Are you a good cook ?
What do you want to hear ?
I will be working all day tomorrow .
I found this book interesting .
Tom , are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
I &apos;d like you to translate this into French .
Did you work yesterday ?
I &apos;ve seen that .
Tom will turn thirty in October .
Tom had his car stolen early last week .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a car .
We must go there whether we like it or not .
Maybe he will arrive tonight .
I don &apos;t want to have to do this .
That girl is more cute than beautiful .
Tom isn &apos;t talking to me .
Thanks for the book .
Tom wouldn &apos;t cry .
Tom was really mad .
What color is your car ?
I have to drive this car .
Tom has done his homework .
Tom told me to speak to you in French .
How about going out to eat tonight ?
I never really thought I &apos;d live this long .
Why does Tom want to do this ?
I want you to like me , Tom .
I don &apos;t like your girlfriend .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll pass the next exam .
I like to walk in the rain .
What happened that made you want to stay ?
I gave you my answer already .
That &apos;s not saying a lot .
That &apos;s to be expected .
You can &apos;t trust anything he says .
Tom realized that Mary was tired .
No one knows their name .
You asked for our help .
Look at what Tom is doing .
I don &apos;t want to see you again .
We should get a new computer .
Tom is able to play soccer .
Do you have any beer ?
That is not my fault .
She works for a hospital .
I was stupid to make a mistake like that .
Tom got up and went away .
Tom can &apos;t walk any more .
Give it back to me .
Do you want me to help you ?
Don &apos;t forget to write me .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word out of you .
I have to walk back to the hotel .
She met him for breakfast .
My uncle has been dead for three years .
Isn &apos;t there something you want to say to me ?
Tom asked me out again .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom won &apos;t do that .
Is it really you ?
Tom looked just like his picture .
I can &apos;t stand that noise anymore .
I believe anything is possible .
Who wants tea ?
When was the last time you lost your keys ?
It was very cold last month .
Where &apos;s Tom now ?
Get those people out of here .
We &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
They &apos;d like that .
Who caught this fish ?
I gave you a book .
You didn &apos;t let me answer .
Why don &apos;t you just go home ?
That &apos;s all I need .
She asked me if I knew Tom &apos;s address .
I &apos;ll try to do that by myself .
He is twice as old as I am .
I &apos;ll never leave you .
I lost the watch that my father gave me .
We want to know why Tom did it .
How may I help you ?
We know what happened last weekend .
We ate together .
I think he &apos;s happy .
Tom did this over a year ago .
Give me some coffee if there is any left .
You &apos;re making that up , aren &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t you want to do that with Tom ?
Tom said he is glad that you &apos;re back .
What , may I ask , is so important ?
You &apos;re old enough to know better .
I only know what I &apos;ve been told .
She is going to have a baby .
Tom didn &apos;t tell anyone why he was late .
What are you thinking about ?
I don &apos;t get you .
What are we supposed to do with it ?
That &apos;s no reason to apologize .
I think you understand me .
I didn &apos;t say anything to anyone .
It &apos;s almost over .
It &apos;s half past eight .
I prefer tea to coffee .
I didn &apos;t hear a word Tom said .
That isn &apos;t my fault .
That &apos;s what I want .
That &apos;s what we want , isn &apos;t it ?
I am very pleased to hear the news .
I got it for Christmas .
Tom put his bag under the table .
In a word , life is short .
Do you feel like going swimming ?
Tom said he would buy it .
You did really well .
Why aren &apos;t you coming with us ?
Don &apos;t be sorry .
Tom has been told not to talk to Mary .
Are you busy on Sunday afternoon ?
Tom had no idea that Mary was already married .
He was poor and couldn &apos;t buy a coat .
Let &apos;s get back to work .
If I had enough money , I could buy it .
She forgot to write him .
Where is your room ?
This book is too expensive .
Nobody lives in this house anymore .
There &apos;s something else I have to tell you .
I know you want to go home .
I will buy a new car next month .
I don &apos;t care what Tom has done .
We can &apos;t go back to the way things were .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with Mary .
Tom lived in Japan for ten years .
He was tired , but he kept on working .
Where is her family ?
This is yours , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;d like you to meet my son .
How long have you been in this town ?
You seem to be in a bad mood today .
I just want you to think about me once in a while .
Tom wasn &apos;t funny .
It is only too true .
It was a good answer .
I need Tom now .
I &apos;m really hungry .
Who found this ?
Tom knows no French .
Tom got drunk again last night .
It &apos;s raining here in Boston .
Maybe that won &apos;t happen .
It is not raining .
He can read and write .
I think Tom has to go to Boston .
I was looking for Tom .
They were ready .
I really like them .
He seemed to know everything about me .
I &apos;m doing what I need to do .
You don &apos;t really care about me .
No one ever saw such a thing .
I don &apos;t know who you are and I don &apos;t care .
You are free to go home .
My wife just had a baby .
I haven &apos;t told him anything .
I couldn &apos;t have done that any better .
The window is open .
We should &apos;ve both stayed awake .
Maybe you should ask around and see what other people think .
We couldn &apos;t do anything for them .
Tom &apos;s finished .
Just how long do you think it &apos;ll take to get there ?
Tom saw that Mary was busy .
When I grow up , I want to be just like you .
Who are those women ?
I had to give up my plan .
The shop is just in front of the station .
He is not coming , either .
You &apos;re right , as always .
He came to ask us to help him .
I enjoy life .
I &apos;ve found Tom .
We were never to see her again .
He wants to be a policeman in the future .
I feel that something is wrong .
She is not herself today .
What did you say your name was ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary about what had happened .
I &apos;ve asked myself that question a hundred times .
Tom watched Mary eat .
Your hair looks great .
Do you think that &apos;s what I want ?
Are you going to help us ?
She isn &apos;t old enough to get a driver &apos;s license .
Did you study French in high school ?
She gets tired quickly .
What am I going to do with this ?
There &apos;s a garden behind our house .
Tom felt lucky .
I want to make you happy .
Did you ever talk to him ?
What school do you want to go to ?
Tom didn &apos;t find Mary &apos;s jokes funny at all .
It &apos;s your money .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
Why aren &apos;t you at Tom &apos;s ?
You &apos;re going to like working for me .
Why does Tom want to go with us ?
How did you pay for this computer ?
Do you really think you can run as fast as me ?
Did he hit you ?
Let &apos;s let Tom decide .
Why do you want one of those ?
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to go to the doctor ?
Tom is looking for you .
Tom confused us .
Tom stayed in his car .
When have you ever done anything for me ?
This is my office .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know French .
May I go home ?
I like milk and bread .
You &apos;re not going to wear that , are you ?
We have a job to do .
I have a lot of friends here .
She does whatever comes into her mind .
Tom changed his mind .
That one &apos;s for me , too .
What does she have ?
I made a big mistake .
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him .
I &apos;m sure Tom would appreciate it .
Tom has gone home .
What &apos;s up there ?
I &apos;d rather not sing that song .
The party is just getting started .
Can he have said such a thing ?
The house by the lake is mine .
I like to be early .
Tom and Mary are both thirty .
Not everyone was satisfied .
What &apos;s Tom up to in Boston ?
Tom has been working all day long .
We have a plan .
I didn &apos;t know Tom lived in Boston .
Tom needs new shoes .
I &apos;ll be around all day .
How old is Tom now ?
Tom will die in prison .
Let &apos;s try !
I told Mary that I loved her .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to give up .
What he did was wrong .
Tom was always there for me .
Do you talk to your dog ?
Tom found that .
My mother is always busy .
English is studied all over the world .
We &apos;ll do everything we can .
It &apos;s part of my job .
I can &apos;t read .
I had two dogs .
I &apos;m so glad you called .
Tom isn &apos;t young .
I only hope it is not too late .
He has no idea what he &apos;s doing .
Let me sleep for another ten minutes .
I pretended to be listening .
Does Tom like his new job ?
We used to work together .
I don &apos;t want to buy this kind of sofa .
Tom knows everything .
You still have much to learn .
Do you like mine ?
I &apos;ll make you happy .
I &apos;m planning to go to bed early tonight .
I only found out about that a few days ago .
Tom asked me questions .
I &apos;ve lost all my money .
Tom said he didn &apos;t believe that Mary would really do that .
She raised her hands .
What &apos;s the difference between a village and a town ?
I don &apos;t love her anymore .
He didn &apos;t see anything .
&quot; Where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I can &apos;t find him . &quot;
I am disappointed that my friend is not here .
Tom brought this .
You must not come into the kitchen .
I &apos;m pleased to finally meet you .
I hate my computer .
I saw you with Tom .
I love learning languages .
I &apos;d like you to go there .
Tom has a son who &apos;s a policeman .
Call me if something happens .
I know him by name .
Tom quit studying French after just three months .
I was sick .
Why don &apos;t you come to the party with us ?
I like him because he is honest .
I &apos;ve already said I don &apos;t know the answer .
That &apos;s what we want to know .
I told Tom he wasn &apos;t welcome here .
Tom can &apos;t afford a new car .
Did Tom ever hurt you ?
Tom is in the house .
He &apos;ll take care of that .
That &apos;s right .
You &apos;re welcome to borrow my car .
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t think John did that with Alice .
He came just as I was leaving .
I never saw him again .
He didn &apos;t run fast enough to catch the train .
Mary is the only girl I &apos;ve ever loved .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be there .
Just follow Tom .
He promised me that he won &apos;t tell anybody .
Tom said he &apos;d do that for Mary .
Tom is a friend .
I don &apos;t want to die tomorrow .
Tom doesn &apos;t even read the newspaper .
What is it , Tom ?
How old do you think Tom is ?
This happens all the time .
He bought a car .
Tom knew Mary wasn &apos;t likely to do that .
We don &apos;t know what Tom wants to do .
We &apos;re going for a walk in the park .
I &apos;m always careful .
Do you know why you &apos;re here ?
What &apos;s my book doing here ?
He works for a bank .
She helped him .
Something &apos;s not right here .
This is the best restaurant I know of .
We &apos;re up against the wall .
I never learned how to write .
Don &apos;t talk about it anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink beer .
I thought I &apos;d lost you forever .
I &apos;m sure Tom would love to see you .
Tom is very rich .
Tom has been found .
That can &apos;t happen .
Tom asked Mary where she had been .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going to do yet .
When are you going to come ?
There &apos;s nothing anyone can do to change it .
Is that so bad ?
I &apos;ll check the list .
I think Tom is going to like it here .
What &apos;s not to like ?
I didn &apos;t know you were rich .
I can &apos;t talk to girls .
Tom told me he had studied French for three years .
There &apos;s a message for you .
There wasn &apos;t anybody there .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice can all speak French .
I didn &apos;t hear what you said .
Why did you go there ?
I promised her not to do it again .
Tom has been sick for a very long time .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
How long have you been in town ?
I &apos;ll go if the weather &apos;s good .
Do I really need to tell you again ?
Why are you doing this to me now ?
I want to see more .
He made believe he was a doctor .
Tom didn &apos;t help .
I thought you said the police would never find us here .
What do you want me to do about it ?
I &apos;ve learned a lot .
That &apos;s what everyone does .
She can speak Japanese .
Tom lived alone for several years .
What are you watching ?
You &apos;re lucky Tom didn &apos;t come .
I feel like I &apos;ve already seen this movie .
Tom was pretty young at the time .
Her son was killed in the accident .
I want to be a good father .
I &apos;m now busy writing a book .
Please just tell me what &apos;s going on .
Are you correct ?
Why does Tom want this ?
Do you have a large family ?
I think it looks great .
If it were not for her help , I would not succeed .
Tom can &apos;t live without a TV .
Are you going to ask Tom ?
Don &apos;t you know what to say ?
Did Tom kill himself ?
How can I get to the station ?
Tom says he used to study French .
I don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
When do we go ?
This is Tom &apos;s umbrella .
Tom bought a hat .
We need a car big enough for the whole family .
Tom &apos;s family is in Boston .
Tom is going out again .
My mom had to lend me her keys .
Tom sat alone .
He had an accident .
I don &apos;t really think so .
I was really young when I met you .
We don &apos;t want it .
What do you like most about Boston ?
Come back tomorrow .
We &apos;re still very busy .
There &apos;s only one solution .
You have to believe in yourself .
I wanted to give Tom some money .
He was standing at the door .
There was nothing for me to drink .
Tom asked a few good questions .
It doesn &apos;t matter now .
I was so worried about you .
I lived in Japan three years ago .
I &apos;m going to take you to Tom .
Tom gave everything he had .
I was late to school .
I &apos;m quite strong .
I saw Tom on Monday .
Everyone knows I &apos;m Tom &apos;s girlfriend .
You don &apos;t drink enough water .
I know that Tom hurt you .
He is very kind to me .
I can &apos;t afford it right now .
Tom left without me .
I &apos;m nothing like you .
I love French .
You &apos;re quite drunk .
I &apos;m not going to drink this .
It &apos;s sad , but true .
That &apos;s why you pay us .
You should arrive at school before eight .
This is the boy I met there yesterday .
Do you know Tom &apos;s dog &apos;s name ?
We didn &apos;t find Tom .
I &apos;m about Tom &apos;s age .
It must be here .
I never get to spend any time with Tom .
You really don &apos;t like me , do you ?
Tom comes to Boston every two months .
Don &apos;t forget to do that today before you go home .
I think we should go .
They &apos;ll know .
I &apos;ll wait outside .
I have to go .
The dog is sleeping .
How do they look ?
Tom will probably be here all afternoon .
You &apos;re good at French , aren &apos;t you ?
Do you know why he has been absent from school ?
Tom &apos;s sick .
I don &apos;t study after school .
Tom and I worked together in Boston .
I know how Tom thinks .
Have you ever forgotten your phone number ?
Go find out .
Do you want to see my cat ?
He has been studying French for eight years .
If only I &apos;d been a little taller !
Tom hardly ever makes a mistake .
I &apos;ve eaten .
We went to college together .
I don &apos;t like apples .
Tom was on television last night .
We &apos;re not getting anywhere .
This machine is out of order .
I will always remember you .
Tom never thought of the future .
Tom asked Mary about her grandmother .
It isn &apos;t over yet .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was ill .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be rich .
Tom can &apos;t buy what he wants to buy because he doesn &apos;t have enough money .
I want a guitar .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows exactly how that happened .
This is how you do it .
I gave Tom Monday off .
&quot; Where is my book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s in the classroom . &quot;
Don &apos;t you know what happened yesterday ?
I must get home before it gets dark .
Where do you really live ?
Aren &apos;t you busy ?
I don &apos;t want to be rich .
I can &apos;t tell you who we are .
They invited her to go to the party .
I like the way you think .
I think I have an idea .
Why didn &apos;t you just pay Tom ?
I feel so lost .
Tom wouldn &apos;t be afraid .
I don &apos;t remember her name .
I wish someone would help me do that .
I remember the day I met you .
I want to hear more about this .
A car &apos;s coming .
Could you solve the problem ?
She seems to have been happy .
She told me everything .
His car isn &apos;t here , so he must have gone .
We &apos;re in love .
Tom is not as smart as he likes to think he is .
Stop here .
I &apos;m a bit hungry .
Nobody knows that better than you .
Give him a break !
I told Tom that I was tired .
We have three kids .
Tom became very busy .
Don &apos;t look at me like that .
I thought Tom would be in his room .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand French .
That &apos;s what we all thought .
I might vote for Tom .
You &apos;re better than me .
I saw Tom less than an hour ago .
I want some cake .
Nobody is too old to learn .
My father does not always walk to work .
Do you know that man ?
It &apos;s not very good .
She was very beautiful when she was young .
Tom , say something .
I do not have a sister .
I &apos;d like to go home .
I want to speak with Tom .
Who else is in there ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll think of something .
Tom seemed to be interested .
Tom &apos;ll speak .
I never drink at home .
That wasn &apos;t your job .
The good news is that we don &apos;t have to go .
Tom stole money from his friends .
That &apos;s not how I want things to be .
I couldn &apos;t stop crying .
If I knew his address , I would write to him .
Tom has loved Mary for a long time .
Is that your umbrella ?
He likes to talk about himself .
If you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
All I have is books .
Do you know why Tom is absent from school ?
I am a Japanese .
You look sad . What &apos;s wrong ?
Your shoes are here . Where are mine ?
Tom is here .
We &apos;re coming to get you .
Tom &apos;s shoes are too big for him .
She wanted to help them .
I think you &apos;ll find it .
He could not speak French well .
I &apos;ll give you a ring tomorrow morning .
The cat is hiding under the couch .
Tom says he was busy .
I went to bed at one o &apos;clock .
Are you sure you &apos;re not tired ?
She works all night .
What &apos;s your decision ?
She hasn &apos;t come here yet .
I know that Tom is tired .
Tom has a big TV .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom &apos;s will be at the party .
I don &apos;t want your help .
He thinks of nothing but himself .
I &apos;m afraid of dying .
Where have you been this week ?
Tom saw Mary , but didn &apos;t say anything to her .
The baby was fast asleep .
I &apos;d like to go to London .
This isn &apos;t my home .
Everyone was there .
Leave us alone .
Don &apos;t come into my room .
Tom didn &apos;t know the rules .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing we can do .
Tom has been waiting for more than three hours .
They are in the way .
Tom saw Mary with another man .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do anything he doesn &apos;t want to do .
Where have you been ?
Tom always does that for me .
This one is Tom &apos;s .
I wish you could &apos;ve come with us .
Tom says he can &apos;t give me what I want .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
What have I done wrong ?
She wrote me a long letter .
I gave up smoking a year ago .
There are many people in the park .
Tom isn &apos;t going to know why .
They really wanted to know what happened .
Tom is scared .
What &apos;s all this noise about ?
You &apos;re looking good .
Is Tom in on this ?
Now I understand it all .
I had no idea you could speak French so well .
I &apos;d like to know what &apos;s happening here .
It &apos;s kind of funny .
I wasn &apos;t home .
Tom wanted to be left alone .
Don &apos;t worry about things that aren &apos;t important .
She doesn &apos;t like anyone .
Tom went abroad to study French .
I &apos;ll never forget this .
She should eat breakfast .
Where did we leave off last time ?
If that &apos;s true , then she &apos;s better than me .
I don &apos;t like Tom that much .
She has been sick since last week .
Why didn &apos;t you help Tom ?
Tom will be able to swim soon .
I asked you not to go there .
Tom loves books .
What &apos;s for dinner tonight ?
Try to do better in the future .
Tom did that very well .
We don &apos;t want that .
Please tell me the way to the post office .
I see him once in a while .
His father is Japanese .
He &apos;s the love of my life .
Look at what Tom &apos;s wearing .
I don &apos;t want to go there again .
I think it &apos;s time to do my homework .
That &apos;s better than nothing .
This dictionary can also help you .
Tom drank Mary under the table .
Tom looks like John .
It &apos;s getting cold .
We do want that , don &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
When I was young , I was living from hand to mouth .
What else does Tom want ?
Tom was healthy .
Tom and Mary are there with John now .
Why did you buy this car ?
Tom looks very happy .
The soup is cold .
When &apos;ll we know how Tom is ?
That &apos;s your job .
Tom was the only one there for me when I really needed someone .
I don &apos;t mind if it &apos;s a little cold .
Are you no longer in pain ?
Tom and I go to church together every Sunday .
I &apos;ll read it .
I &apos;ll be good to you .
It &apos;s very hard for me to trust anyone .
I quit smoking six months ago .
I think Tom kind of likes Mary .
I visited my grandmother &apos;s house .
Tom could &apos;ve bought this car .
Were Tom and Mary together ?
You should listen to your wife .
I haven &apos;t changed .
It &apos;s pretty clear you have a problem .
Where are you taking us ?
I &apos;ll do what I can .
Maybe we should try again .
I would think that Tom would appreciate your help .
Tom has young children .
Tom was here , too .
Tom and Mary never do anything together anymore .
What more can I do ?
Tom loves to run .
The boy didn &apos;t change his opinion .
Can you please translate this for me ?
Tom is sure .
I can fix that for you .
I &apos;ve been waiting for Tom for a long time .
My apartment is too small .
I wonder why he was absent .
The books are on the table .
I think I &apos;m in love .
It might be a long time before we meet again .
Tom lost all of his money .
You &apos;re going to do fine .
Tom is mad at Mary .
I &apos;m feeling sick .
Tom is standing .
I don &apos;t have the address with me .
Can you help me find it ?
I &apos;ve already spoken to Tom .
That &apos;s all they had .
She didn &apos;t say a word to me all night .
He cannot afford it .
Tom wanted to be a teacher .
This place is nice and quiet .
I didn &apos;t see either boy .
Don &apos;t make so much noise .
I don &apos;t say it without reason .
I want to go to the city .
Tom has more than enough money to buy a car .
Isn &apos;t there something else we can do ?
It &apos;s possible .
Tom is on vacation in Australia .
I think it &apos;s time for you to go home .
Tom asked me to do that for him .
How many were there ?
How many eggs are there in the kitchen ?
Where are the keys ?
I can explain it .
I think that Tom is thirty years old .
Where are the children ?
It was cold .
I won &apos;t be home for a week .
They arrived before you .
You look worried .
Let me buy you a new one .
I &apos;d like to go home early today .
Will you take care of my dog while I am away ?
Don &apos;t you agree ?
This is the house in which he was born .
Tom smiled at Mary and she smiled back .
Your friend is very lucky .
I asked Tom if he knew Mary .
I stayed at home because I was sick .
I am fat .
He has visited France three times .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to talk to me .
I used to work in Boston .
They don &apos;t want you to know .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand a thing .
I can &apos;t afford it .
Tom &apos;s father is rich .
Tom never takes the train .
When is breakfast ?
Is that clock working ?
No one loves you .
Tom gave us some food .
This was a lot of fun .
I don &apos;t know what Tom knows .
I have to finish up some things before I go .
Aren &apos;t you Tom &apos;s mother ?
Could you bring me some water ?
I speak English every day .
Do you like my hair ?
Tom has finally finished doing his homework .
I know how we can help .
Tom put on a coat .
What does he want to do ?
Do they have that ?
Tom will arrive in Boston at 2 : 30 .
Tom gave it to me .
Tom lied about his age .
When are you coming to Boston ?
Both Tom and I work .
Tom bought this house thirty years ago .
She likes the teacher .
Tom wants you to do it for him .
Tom was telling the truth .
I bought this book for myself , not for my wife .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want to do that ?
I speak French as well as she does .
I &apos;m at home every evening .
Thanks for seeing me .
She is going to learn how to drive .
Tom is a tall man .
I like my job .
I &apos;d like you to meet my sister .
I &apos;ll be with you .
I mean it .
Tom doesn &apos;t want you to get hurt .
You &apos;re the one I love .
I came yesterday .
Would you like to say anything ?
I haven &apos;t seen her since last month .
Please get out of my office immediately .
We should &apos;ve helped Tom more .
Tom looks great .
Do you want me to call Tom ?
They &apos;re quiet .
He doesn &apos;t want you to know .
Now listen carefully .
We need the money .
It &apos;s impossible for me to explain it to you .
Tom is going to want to do that .
I still can &apos;t dance .
We &apos;re still looking .
Tom may not be there .
I gave Tom a chance to work for me .
This milk has gone bad .
Tom arrived first .
We don &apos;t do that .
Aren &apos;t you going to do it ?
I heard you crying .
He &apos;ll understand .
It is a lot of fun to listen to music .
You should &apos;ve told me earlier .
I read a letter .
What did you do today ?
Are they busy ?
It would be better for you to read more books .
I don &apos;t like this game .
That &apos;s right , isn &apos;t it ?
How long have you been studying English ?
Tom might not be in Australia anymore .
It was dark by then .
How long will you be home ?
Tom is really confused .
There &apos;s another reason .
We cannot do without salt even for a single day .
My children really like animals .
Is eating fish good for you ?
I &apos;m looking for a gift for my friend .
Tom won &apos;t stop .
Tom said he was asked to help .
Tom took the knife away from Mary .
Tom never goes to school by bus .
I want one like that .
I have to look for my friends .
We know who they are .
We have to do this right away .
We have finished the work for today .
You &apos;ve made a mistake .
Are you still angry ?
He may have missed his usual bus .
You should stay in bed .
Where is Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom needs a new pair of shoes .
In this case , I think he is correct .
Tom and Mary were the last two to leave .
Let &apos;s eat out .
That &apos;s possible .
I have a big dog .
I &apos;ll visit my uncle next week .
We &apos;re getting a new car next month .
They are going to meet at the hotel tomorrow .
Will Tom kiss Mary ?
How &apos;s the weather ?
Do you remember when Tom said that ?
They are my brothers .
She didn &apos;t go far .
Is anything the matter with him ?
When did you begin playing golf ?
I &apos;ve never had a friend quite like you .
I don &apos;t care how poor you are .
Tom loved me .
Do you know what you need to do ?
What do you like about her ?
I can &apos;t live that kind of life .
I just don &apos;t know what to do .
Do you know how busy I &apos;ve been ?
Everything is ready .
Tom heard someone calling for help .
He gave me several books .
What language are you speaking ?
That school looks just like a prison .
You don &apos;t have to wait until the end .
I &apos;m so fat .
I don &apos;t remember what time Tom told me to meet him tomorrow .
He comes here every five days .
I must go alone .
I like learning languages .
I &apos;m not your friend .
I heard it hasn &apos;t changed .
I think that &apos;s a bad solution .
They &apos;re all good .
I think I &apos;m just tired .
Tom pretended to not hear a thing .
What do you call this bird in English ?
My car is red .
Where did they go ?
He has a lot of money in the bank .
It did happen .
What will we eat ?
I bought this camera yesterday .
It isn &apos;t a dream .
What does this machine do exactly ?
She plays tennis with her friends once a week .
What do you want now ?
They know what &apos;s going on .
I had trouble with this question .
What &apos;s your favorite city in the United States ?
You have to believe in something .
I &apos;m looking for someone who knows French .
Tom has already eaten lunch .
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary was the one who did that .
I have to go to the library with Tom .
There are a lot of dogs here , aren &apos;t there ?
She is lucky .
My father is in .
Do you want to know what &apos;s wrong ?
Aren &apos;t you tired ?
Is it really worth it ?
What &apos;s all that ?
When are you going to get married ?
I did nothing .
I have sisters .
Don &apos;t let him listen to this music .
I never wanted Tom here in the first place .
We can &apos;t trust what she says .
I am glad to be with you .
May I please have your telephone number ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do that , could he ?
You don &apos;t have the time .
I am going to miss you .
Tom and Mary want to tell us something .
Tom doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s such a big deal .
Why can &apos;t Tom just tell me what &apos;s going on ?
They &apos;ll like it .
Tom had three of them .
Do you have a key to Tom &apos;s apartment ?
Tom kept Mary waiting .
Tom seemed surprised by this .
Now that I am here , you don &apos;t have to worry .
Tom isn &apos;t doing a very good job .
My French is not good at all .
Could you do that ?
Don &apos;t talk about this to anyone .
Come here .
Tom is going to Boston with me .
Tom was gone for three days .
Where is your house ?
My grandfather gets up early .
You &apos;re welcome to wait .
I have a different opinion than yours .
Maybe he did it on purpose .
I bought this book yesterday .
I asked him to do that .
The mother didn &apos;t know what to do with her son .
I like my life .
I wasn &apos;t honest .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s car .
Where do you see yourself in five years ?
I don &apos;t hear anything .
There was nobody here yesterday .
The water is hot .
I &apos;d like to work in Australia .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along too well .
He &apos;s good at telling jokes .
Tom began to talk .
I need a new pair of shoes .
Tom had only three dollars on him .
Nothing can be better than that .
I want to know why .
Do you like going to school ?
I &apos;m happy to have you here , Tom .
You must clean your room every day .
Where does Tom study ?
Can I catch a taxi here ?
I don &apos;t want to live in Boston .
When will he go home ?
Let &apos;s walk a little faster .
I didn &apos;t know that you used to work here .
I have to explain this to Tom .
Tom won &apos;t listen to me .
Tom could hardly understand what Mary said .
Tom sold his house three months ago .
The answer is anything but simple .
You should buy it for yourself .
I haven &apos;t walked to school in a long time .
Are you happy or not ?
This kind of work is very dangerous .
That student runs fast , doesn &apos;t he ?
Who looks after the children ?
This is the last game .
Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell .
No one knows me like you do .
Why did you ask ?
Tom and Mary are college students .
Tom was very lucky .
That &apos;s how we do it in Boston .
Tom didn &apos;t come on time .
I know his address .
I &apos;m happy to see you here .
It &apos;s our fault .
Do you think it &apos;ll rain today ?
It wasn &apos;t clear what she meant .
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
She brought me a cup of tea .
He is studying at his desk .
Here &apos;s the answer to your question .
Tom is listening to Mary .
What on earth is this ?
Are you sure about all this ?
Tom did it for his family .
The man &apos;s name is Tom .
Tom looks after us .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is looking for .
I &apos;m not too worried about Tom .
My uncle runs a hotel .
These flowers are for Mary , not for you .
I think Tom is great .
I &apos;m just trying to help .
You can &apos;t go back there .
It won &apos;t be long before my husband comes back .
You haven &apos;t changed at all .
Tom likes good food .
What &apos;re you doing in my house ?
Tom said something in French that I couldn &apos;t understand .
Who left the window open ?
I already know how to dance .
Why would Tom want to go there ?
Can I have some more rice , please ?
Which car is your father &apos;s ?
Where did Tom go yesterday ?
I have something else for you .
The price is good .
I don &apos;t remember that guy &apos;s name .
What you &apos;re saying is true .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
I was too drunk .
Can &apos;t you help me just a little bit ?
You have only to give him a little help .
I asked Tom what was wrong .
I fell in love with him .
I want eggs for breakfast tomorrow morning .
I should go help Tom .
I have a good friend in Boston .
This house is too big for us .
You have mail .
I &apos;ll say no more .
I &apos;ll telephone you every night .
This tree is older than I am .
I &apos;m happy to have you as a student .
Tom has already gone to bed .
I &apos;m going to miss you , Tom .
You gave it to us .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t ever see Alice again .
They are very old .
We should read as many books as possible .
Please let me know when I should get off .
Nobody likes Tom .
Here is a present for your birthday .
I thought you could help us .
I still want to go .
It seems to be serious .
Don &apos;t speak so fast .
We appreciate your help .
Was it good ?
Nothing is working .
Someone has to tell Tom .
What do you call this fish in English ?
I can &apos;t be bought .
This house is very big , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom didn &apos;t want us at his party .
I don &apos;t have to worry about money .
It isn &apos;t here anymore .
How &apos;s it going , Tom ?
Tom takes care of my children .
I was certain that you &apos;d come .
I saw the message .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom help anyone .
I can &apos;t let you risk it .
Be nice to the children .
What Tom said is true .
My children don &apos;t listen to me .
The weather is beautiful .
I gave Tom that .
I saw her a week ago .
I want them all .
I &apos;m still working on that .
Is that boy Tom ?
He often goes with her to watch movies .
Tom broke up with Mary .
Tom saw Mary at school .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s idea .
Why do you think I &apos;m not happy ?
I will have finished the work by eight o &apos;clock .
Tom doesn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s taking Tom so long .
She &apos;s been absent from school for five days .
She asked me how old I was .
What did you take a picture of ?
Are they American ?
I need to open this door .
We &apos;ve waited long enough .
She suddenly became famous .
I quickly tried to get advice from him .
You think you know me pretty well , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t know your brother .
He spent the night at his uncle &apos;s place .
I don &apos;t want someone else . I want you .
You didn &apos;t say that before .
I don &apos;t like living here .
We want to see Tom .
Tom immediately began doing that again .
They live from hand to mouth .
I have nothing to do at the moment .
There is no time to lose .
You have my word on that .
I don &apos;t know yet .
Do you have a table ?
You didn &apos;t have to do this .
I have never been to Paris .
Tom &apos;s grandfather couldn &apos;t read .
Tom must be home by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;m going to go get Tom .
I hear from him once a month .
I &apos;m not in trouble .
Tom has enough money to buy it .
I will do it right now .
Tom isn &apos;t very likely to be fired for doing that .
I hate not being able to understand things when people are speaking French .
Tom &apos;s father died before he was born .
Whose bicycle is that ?
Where are Tom &apos;s things ?
This car is good .
Tom has been working here for over three years .
I thought about Tom .
I &apos;ll sleep on the floor .
Why is Tom home ?
Are you guys going to be OK ?
Don &apos;t call Tom at his home after 2 : 30 .
Where have they taken Tom ?
Some people can &apos;t do this .
I thought Tom and Mary were hungry .
I &apos;ll see you at nine tomorrow morning .
I thought you were into it .
We have a lot to do .
Are you with us , Tom ?
I finally found a place where we can be alone .
You didn &apos;t have to come so early .
Tom had to wait .
I knew you were lying .
Tom takes the kids to the school every day .
Tom knew he didn &apos;t have enough money .
They sell sugar and salt at that store .
Are you going to use this ?
You &apos;d give up .
How kind of you !
Tom and the others left early .
What language was that ?
Where do you go from here ?
He would like to come with us to the movie .
Here is your bag .
We can &apos;t afford to make any mistakes .
How are you ?
She kept quiet .
Why did you start learning French ?
Many college students don &apos;t have a lot of money .
Tom left for work earlier than usual .
No one was awake yet .
When he was young , he would often watch baseball .
This door would not open .
Tom is the one with the problem , not me .
We can &apos;t even be certain that it was Tom we saw .
Tom could do this .
She went on working .
I know what &apos;s going on here .
What &apos;s mine &apos;s yours .
What &apos;s your opinion on that ?
Do you like this garden ?
I managed to find his office .
I think it &apos;s about time for us to leave .
I don &apos;t like it at all .
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you . You must ask someone else .
One cup of coffee , please .
Are you going to use that ?
I saw how Tom was doing that .
I want to ask you about Tom .
How would you translate this sentence ?
Is it white ?
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here .
We found Tom .
Make it short , Tom .
Why isn &apos;t Tom coming ?
I almost died today .
I will take it .
My father is here .
I was playing tennis .
We have been together for a year .
You had better ask the doctor for advice .
Tom has many friends living in Boston .
There is one thing that I don &apos;t understand .
Tom is just a few years older than me .
Are you a student ?
It is his decision .
She can &apos;t have said so .
Tom gave Mary everything .
Tom is out in the garden .
Tom is too young to know the truth .
Tom is Mary &apos;s father .
Can we do that before Monday ?
I &apos;m going to study .
What time does the first train leave ?
How many times have I told you not to do that ?
Why don &apos;t you two go on a date together ?
Tom was correct all along .
Do you know who those people are ?
I can cook .
Is this what you want me to do ?
I don &apos;t want this anymore .
It looks like the TV isn &apos;t working .
Take my coat .
I have to look after this cat .
Tom made mistakes .
Has anything like this ever happened to you before ?
Are you going to give up ?
He made his parents happy .
What will you take for this chair ?
I &apos;ll call when I &apos;ve finished the work .
Let &apos;s sit down on that bench .
Some of us went by bus , and the others by bicycle .
My father has a restaurant .
I could have been killed .
I haven &apos;t seen much of Tom recently .
I thought you might &apos;ve left town .
She is almost as tall as you .
Do you really want to go back to Boston ?
I will have to study tomorrow .
I found it easy to solve the problem .
I &apos;m thirty years old .
He had a new idea .
What time does the bus leave ?
It &apos;s never too late to learn .
Why haven &apos;t you called ?
You &apos;re drunk .
Tom is waiting for the bus .
I like to come here .
Tom is staying .
Do you have any pictures of Boston ?
How can you eat so much ?
Go play with Tom .
Why don &apos;t you stop by for a little while ?
You &apos;re innocent .
I think it &apos;s time for me to do my homework .
You wouldn &apos;t want that to happen , would you ?
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m busy right now .
I thought he would come .
I don &apos;t know who I should ask .
Tom doesn &apos;t know any French .
I can explain everything .
I think Tom said he was from Boston .
Tom has no choice .
We kind of expected this to happen .
I haven &apos;t talked to Tom for quite some time .
Something was about to happen .
I received a letter written in English .
Why aren &apos;t you in school ?
&quot; What did you tell Tom ? &quot; &quot; I told him the truth . &quot;
I should have told her that I love her .
That &apos;s what makes this so difficult .
Tom may have been there . I don &apos;t know .
Is Tom famous ?
Tom thinks that he &apos;s better than other people .
I &apos;ll give that to you .
He doesn &apos;t have as many books as she does .
I &apos;m a long way from home .
I saw her last week .
I don &apos;t know what you want to hear .
I don &apos;t want you .
It isn &apos;t easy to understand his ideas .
I know nothing about you .
That &apos;s a big problem .
I think we should just be friends .
Have you already finished your homework ?
My father plays tennis every Sunday .
I &apos;m going to wait outside .
Tom rarely ever spoke .
Tom read the letter .
We need to do it immediately .
I &apos;d like to make you a proposal .
He is rich enough to buy two cars .
Are you eating lunch ?
May I have a look at that ?
His word is law .
Maybe Tom should study French .
We &apos;re happy .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
I have a computer .
I think your answer is correct .
It seems that she is not pleased with the job .
I &apos;m not the one who told Tom .
What time does she get up ?
Would you stop that , please ?
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to a movie with me .
They seldom , if ever , speak in French .
This is my new car .
Someone is in the kitchen with Tom .
Tom just died .
I don &apos;t really want to be all by myself .
You were told this would happen .
Tom is writing again .
Can you be sure ?
Don &apos;t go in there .
If the car is gone , he can &apos;t be at the office .
They move from place to place .
I &apos;m going to leave school .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I like to read before I go to bed .
Where do they do that ?
I &apos;ve come to get you .
I know where they &apos;re taking Tom .
Tom asked Mary to stay .
I really need it .
I won &apos;t forget this .
You must see a doctor .
Tom asked Mary not to go alone .
I don &apos;t like that one .
I &apos;m going to go to the doctor this afternoon .
They &apos;re our friends .
Tom didn &apos;t sleep .
How much does a room cost ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t even speak to me .
What &apos;s your favorite city in the world ?
Do you want anything to eat ?
You look young for your age .
I can &apos;t give you that .
I want a new car .
Tom and I enjoy talking with each other .
We won &apos;t stand a chance .
He has left his family .
I have a few friends here .
It &apos;s me !
I &apos;m not good at speaking French yet .
Tom didn &apos;t even look at the report that Mary gave him .
How long have you known me , Tom ?
I &apos;m the one you want .
Tom seemed mad .
Are you thinking about me ?
I still have work to do .
Tom wasn &apos;t nice .
You &apos;re the only one for me now .
Tom should wait .
What &apos;s Tom done ?
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
I don &apos;t like meat .
I haven &apos;t seen her in years .
I agree to his plan .
I hate those .
I have to take off .
I take back everything I &apos;ve said .
We &apos;re back from Australia .
Can I see that ?
I couldn &apos;t make it .
Tom says I can &apos;t stay home alone .
She is beautiful .
She may be proud of her daughter .
I finished the work in less than an hour .
They &apos;re always careful .
There &apos;s no one there .
What &apos;ll you have for dinner tonight ?
This book is really interesting .
How did you like that movie ?
Everyone has been there .
I had better ask her .
We just want you to be happy .
I still haven &apos;t found what I &apos;m looking for .
Tom got in his car and drove away .
My dog didn &apos;t do that .
You &apos;re not going .
There was nobody in the room .
Tom wants to go by train .
I got my hair done yesterday .
I wish you &apos;d told me that a bit earlier .
I didn &apos;t catch even one fish .
Are you good at speaking French ?
I &apos;m through doing that .
It &apos;s not so hot today .
Tom and Mary are at home today .
What did you expect me to say ?
Tom is the one who was taken to the hospital .
Tom says I make him nervous .
This desk is broken .
What are you sitting on ?
That &apos;s not nice .
What do you enjoy doing ?
Bring the book to me , not to Tom .
I got what she was saying .
Tom will be there .
It looks like we &apos;ll get there in time .
Everybody calls him Tom .
You aren &apos;t rich , are you ?
Why is Tom here ?
It &apos;s very nice of you to help me .
Tom &apos;ll call .
That is a table .
Tom has quite a lot of money .
I must hurry .
She came to see me the other day .
He &apos;s not one of us .
I am certain that he will pass the exam .
It isn &apos;t likely that she will come .
He will be here any moment .
I know Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
He himself did it .
I worked hard all day long yesterday .
I &apos;m glad you were there .
Thanks for doing all this .
He goes there every day .
Nobody &apos;ll know .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
The students of this school are kind .
I &apos;m looking forward to going to the concert .
Where do you get your hair done ?
Tom never visited Mary .
When &apos;s Tom coming ?
I can &apos;t remember exactly who told me that .
Is Tom in ?
I found the room empty .
Tom is no longer here .
Let &apos;s call a doctor .
Tom was married to Mary .
You tried .
There are many old men in this village .
Tom may do that .
Tom came to Japan as a child .
You can study here .
I saw him with my own eyes .
I really mean it .
My family is not that large .
I enjoy being with you .
Do you believe in such things ?
I only speak a little French .
Tom and Mary are friends of my family .
Everybody knows we don &apos;t like each other .
How many people have you told ?
Can I talk to you alone for a second ?
Tom has a picture he wants to show Mary .
Do you know how ?
Tom will know what this is .
You must do as I say .
I know Tom &apos;s father .
Let me have a look at it .
The teacher will call us when he &apos;s ready .
Tom drove .
How do you want me to do that ?
Tom and Mary have been married for three years .
I hope war doesn &apos;t break out .
I visited my friend Tom yesterday .
I hope this works .
I know Tom &apos;s secret .
I was scared of Tom .
I just heard that Tom and Mary are going to get married .
Can he speak English ?
I know that wasn &apos;t how I was supposed to do that .
I understood nothing .
Did they come today ?
Tom isn &apos;t tired .
&quot; Where is her book ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s on the table . &quot;
I have a different opinion on that subject .
Tom was supposed to be at school today , but he wasn &apos;t .
She saw a lot of animals on the road .
I &apos;m never eating here again .
You should have helped him with his work .
What do you think he did ?
I liked everything .
There &apos;s a letter for you .
I spent the whole day playing with my kids .
I &apos;m giving it to Tom .
I stayed there until he had left .
How soon can we get started ?
We just need a plan .
Tom is making me do this .
I didn &apos;t eat anything .
I &apos;ll be back at seven o &apos;clock .
I can hear Tom &apos;s voice .
What kind of movie do you want to watch ?
We have to be there Monday .
I &apos;ll give you this camera .
Tom never saw Mary again .
Tom was nervous .
I don &apos;t see that there &apos;s a choice .
Tom said he didn &apos;t drink coffee .
I &apos;ve never been here before .
Tom had a lot to do .
Tom has barely said a word all day .
Tom tried to solve the problem .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d enjoy doing that .
I had to do everything alone .
Who talked ?
She drives very fast .
It &apos;s dangerous out there .
I can walk from my house to the station in only five minutes .
Tom saw you .
Can I take a day off ?
Tom said he was too drunk to help me do that .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t even know why I don &apos;t like him .
I know almost nothing about it .
Tom stayed behind .
It &apos;s up to you to make a choice .
Tom seems busy .
I tried hard .
Tom may not know .
Tom wanted to talk with Mary .
It could be anywhere .
Are you just going to stand there all day ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in the city .
Tom and Mary were also there .
I want you to leave right now .
You will do it whether you like it or not .
Can you play the guitar ?
Maybe you didn &apos;t understand me .
I don &apos;t know who it is .
I need some bread and milk .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
We only use French at home .
I &apos;ve always been impressed by how well you speak French .
Tom has to do this .
I don &apos;t care what happens .
I wanted to show it to you .
Can you get me another pencil ?
You should phone your mother as soon as you can .
I love her .
Let me know how it goes .
We can &apos;t win .
Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was beautiful .
Tom asked something .
I &apos;ll be present .
We weren &apos;t able to help Tom .
I &apos;m here looking for Tom .
I wish I could understand you better .
I wish I had more time to talk with you .
We don &apos;t need you .
Everyone loves that place .
I &apos;m not sure how Tom will do it .
Is Tom still able to drive ?
Tom lost his parents when he was young .
The cats are safe .
I &apos;m still in love with Tom .
He does nothing but cry .
Tom likes to talk .
You ought to trust me .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll have enough time .
Why don &apos;t you come visit us ?
I have to see you .
Get your hands off of Tom .
Can you please say that again ?
Was it fun doing that ?
Tom has trouble reading .
What else can you do ?
Tom bought his son a car .
I &apos;ll wait for you in the hotel tomorrow .
Tom needs to be very careful .
Tom has enough money to do whatever he wants to do .
Tom was sleeping .
Tom asked Mary to make him something to eat .
Tom wants to take you home .
Who lives in this house ?
I &apos;m in trouble . I need your help .
I should &apos;ve listened to Tom .
Give them to her .
This boy is my son .
My children don &apos;t speak French yet .
Which hat do you want to buy ?
It &apos;s fine today .
I want to wait for Tom .
&quot; Is he coming ? &quot; &quot; No , I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
Tom has his kid with him .
Tom had to stay in the hospital .
He sat in the chair .
Tom saw Mary dancing with John .
I think it &apos;d be fun .
We have less than an hour .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to find a job .
Many of my friends don &apos;t have children .
Tom told me everything .
I know what &apos;s right .
We enjoyed watching the TV .
I wasn &apos;t born yesterday !
I &apos;ve been in Boston since October .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t have children .
Let &apos;s not talk about it any more .
Have you heard from him ?
You &apos;re not telling me anything I haven &apos;t already heard .
It &apos;s impossible .
Mary is the only girl I &apos;ve ever been in love with .
I know it &apos;s not impossible .
Aren &apos;t you interested ?
Tom left for home well over an hour ago .
Tom is barely alive .
There &apos;s still a lot to do .
Those two really hit it off .
Who is it that you want to talk to ?
I &apos;m supposed to go to Boston on Monday .
You &apos;ll miss me .
Aren &apos;t you brothers ?
Is there another door ?
I &apos;m sure about this .
Are you still interested in learning how to speak French ?
I look forward to seeing you at Christmas .
Mary can &apos;t have any more children .
You scared Tom .
Tom wanted to talk to you .
Tom told me he was going to go home early today .
He drank beer .
It is easy to answer this question .
What do you think these are ?
I think you have a problem , Tom .
The story appears to be true .
He looked very tired .
Tom liked working here .
My house is big .
It has never been done before .
I wish I had known .
I &apos;ve got as much to lose here as you do .
What books have you read in French ?
Tom wondered if it was true .
You &apos;ve got to help me learn to drive .
It &apos;s time you went to bed .
I think Tom should see this .
She left the window open .
She &apos;s a good person .
Let &apos;s go see Tom .
Where is Tom going to go ?
I &apos;m sorry about what happened yesterday .
What &apos;s the date of the letter ?
Why don &apos;t they like me ?
He doesn &apos;t want to see you .
I don &apos;t feel like studying at all tonight .
I &apos;m going to have to run .
Tom and Mary just got married .
I thought that was the case .
I really enjoyed the party .
They aren &apos;t here yet .
Someone will do that job .
Tom returned one day earlier than expected .
We are not expecting any help from you .
Do you want to go home ?
I &apos;ll do what I need to do .
Tom hasn &apos;t had his lunch yet .
Now don &apos;t move .
I will come by all means .
Has Tom called yet ?
What are you reading ?
Tom had to lend Mary some money so she could take the bus home .
Every time I see you , I think of your mother .
Why does that make a difference ?
Please give me a cup of milk .
I &apos;m sorry I let you down .
Are you bored ?
He sat in front of me .
Give it to her .
There &apos;s nothing I &apos;d like more than to spend the afternoon with you .
I believe I have now told you everything .
I &apos;ve come all the way from Boston .
I &apos;ll be back by six o &apos;clock .
The only thing we can do is wait .
Mary has her problems .
I saw Tom again .
She wouldn &apos;t speak to him .
What would the world be like without women ?
Tom is calm and patient .
Tom isn &apos;t with me .
I have a small favor to ask .
I saw something .
I love you more and more every day .
This is your key .
Don &apos;t you want to go to the party ?
They look great .
Tom threw the ball to Mary .
There are seven days in a week .
I still can &apos;t believe you and Tom got married .
Tom doesn &apos;t think he could do that .
We have yet to learn the truth .
I barely feel the pain anymore .
This is the way he learned English .
I love my country .
I was just going to call you .
I know that Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
It &apos;s likely to rain tomorrow .
Please leave Tom alone .
I have only just arrived .
Will Tom sing ?
Tom worked all day yesterday .
There isn &apos;t much time left .
Tom won &apos;t speak to Mary .
How old is this dog ?
I can &apos;t believe it !
It &apos;s my book .
That &apos;s up to Tom , not me .
I could be in my office all day .
This coat does not fit me any more .
I don &apos;t know what to do with this .
Tom came back after many years .
He did not go out , but sat down .
I thought you said you knew Tom .
I &apos;m at my parents &apos; .
Leave my car alone .
What would you like to have ?
Tom often talks with Mary .
I &apos;m here , too .
She married him .
He has gone too far .
How did the exam go ?
I love this car .
Those are Tom &apos;s .
Tom didn &apos;t come to school yesterday .
Do you want to see it ?
What &apos;re you eating ?
John is two years older than me .
Will you call me a taxi , please ?
Why are you learning English ?
Can you drive ?
He took off his coat and put it on again .
What you need is a friend .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary is like .
I thought you might be interested in this .
I eat lunch in that restaurant every day .
I &apos;m busy .
Nobody can stop Tom .
We &apos;ll do that .
Our company isn &apos;t very big .
You don &apos;t need a list .
We &apos;re about the same age .
I &apos;m really sorry about that .
Here is the bill .
I hope it won &apos;t rain tomorrow .
Tom never made it back home last night .
He doesn &apos;t look his age .
Don &apos;t ever talk to me like that again .
You look just like your big brother .
We &apos;ll show Tom .
There are a lot of people here .
We haven &apos;t seen each other for such a long time .
I really hope so .
Tom seldom makes mistakes .
Did Tom come here yesterday ?
Please let me know .
I heard that he &apos;d died .
Tom could easily have done that .
Everyone wants what they can &apos;t have .
I agree with his plan .
What have you taken ?
You should go home . It &apos;s late and you &apos;re drunk .
You should probably tell Tom how to do that .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what to do .
I don &apos;t think they &apos;re married .
I &apos;m not listening to you .
Tom knew that .
We are glad to help you .
Why is everybody scared of Tom ?
You ought to ask him for advice .
The answer is no .
A trip to America is out of the question .
Tom wanted to see Mary again .
Tom said the soup was too hot .
Tom is hiding from them .
Get Tom to help you .
My mother is a good woman .
Tom knows Mary &apos;s dog &apos;s name .
I &apos;ve decided to stay in Boston .
We have one for you , too .
I think we should talk .
Tom is playing with Mary &apos;s cat .
Tom has finally finished doing that .
He didn &apos;t show up .
I &apos;m trying to study .
Maybe Tom should &apos;ve stayed with the children .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I think most people would agree .
Now I &apos;m angry .
The piano is expensive .
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this ?
I &apos;m not leaving here .
Can you lend me some money ?
I took the day off .
That cannot be true .
Thank you for the present .
He wants to learn to swim .
Tom believed everything Mary told him .
Nobody can understand it .
I want to play , too .
Where did it happen ?
Aren &apos;t you scared ?
Are you really going to move to Boston ?
He asked me if I had slept well the night before .
Tom wrote me a letter .
Tom is the one you want .
Why don &apos;t you go in my place ?
I think that that book is not so interesting .
Where is Tom from ?
This isn &apos;t the first time Tom has been late .
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary .
I know Tom isn &apos;t very happy here .
I asked Tom what he thought of Mary .
Tom knew nothing .
Tom seems to be getting angry .
Do you want me to go ?
They need to work tomorrow .
He knows us very well .
Where &apos;re you going ?
I &apos;ll do what must be done .
The coffee is hot .
I have to walk slowly .
Don &apos;t you want to study ?
Does Tom have to be here ?
Tom didn &apos;t have Mary &apos;s address with him .
There is a television in the room .
You might try asking Tom .
I remember her face , but I don &apos;t remember her name .
He is having dinner .
No matter what he does , he does it well .
When you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
What actually happened ?
I visited her on Sunday morning .
Do you know when they &apos;ll arrive ?
Tom had to start over again .
That &apos;s what I should &apos;ve done .
Do you want me to open the box ?
I used to play tennis when I was a student .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid .
Did your mother make those ?
I &apos;ll ask Tom what he thinks .
We &apos;re coming with you , Tom .
I &apos;m feeling good this morning .
I like you , too .
Have I forgotten anything ?
I &apos;m not certain .
Where was he born ?
I always think of him when I &apos;m alone .
Tom said he was very tired .
I &apos;ll help as much as I can .
Tom took some more of the bread .
There &apos;s too much I don &apos;t know .
They &apos;ve still got Tom .
Maybe I should &apos;ve told Tom .
It seems to run in the family .
Here &apos;s the one I like .
Tom looks really good .
Tom should &apos;ve told us about that earlier .
Tom can &apos;t afford to get married .
Let me explain why .
Tom is going to love it here .
I know your type .
Do you know if Tom has already eaten ?
What do you want for lunch ?
Our house is very small .
I like your thinking .
He said to himself , &quot; I will do it . &quot;
I never asked for it .
I want to tell you something .
How is your father ?
That sounds stupid .
Don &apos;t you want me to go with you ?
Where is the beach ?
Tom is busy writing a letter .
I hope you &apos;ll come again some day .
How &apos;s it going down there ?
Tom started laughing again .
Tom knows what happened .
Tom will stop you .
I need to show you something .
I hope Tom is interested .
I am from Tokyo .
Don &apos;t you want to come with us ?
Tom took Mary out to dinner .
It has happened at least three times .
Tom took to drinking after his wife left him .
Where &apos;s my money ?
I am happy to have so many good friends .
I &apos;m not a little boy anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t know me .
Tom knows where Mary went .
I &apos;m eating rice now .
Tom spent more than three years in prison .
Do you enjoy losing ?
Tom really doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary where he was .
Did you see your friends last week ?
I &apos;m sure he will come tomorrow .
Tom was angry with his wife .
It &apos;ll just take a moment .
If I knew her address , I would write to her .
Tom has been busy all morning .
I was very poor in those days .
Tom never killed anybody .
Tom often comes late .
I plan to contact Tom by phone tomorrow and ask him to help us .
I &apos;ll go myself if I need to .
The word is not in my dictionary .
They don &apos;t know yet .
Please come into my room to help me .
We &apos;ve had a lot of rain this month .
I can &apos;t believe I did that .
There was someone else there .
We &apos;ll be home all day tomorrow .
Tom ran to catch the last train .
Tom had other things he wanted to buy .
Tom said that nothing had changed .
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow .
This book isn &apos;t as heavy as that one .
Have your own way .
My friend is seriously injured .
What is over there ?
That &apos;s up to Tom .
Why am I doing this ?
Would you mind if I ask you a question ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait .
You can eat lunch here in this room .
I thought you &apos;d want to know .
I don &apos;t want to go to work .
Tom is proud of his family .
I just want to be your friend .
You know this is what I want .
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice .
Please keep quiet .
Do you want me to drive ?
They are my sisters .
Don &apos;t ask me what that is .
Tom is going to win .
He can play the guitar .
What was it you wanted to ask me to do ?
Tom is too young to do that .
The girl playing the piano is my sister .
You can &apos;t fix it . You should buy a new one .
I &apos;ve never told anyone before .
Why are people scared of you ?
Tom was the only guy in the class .
Are you sure that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to be done ?
I &apos;d like to , but I can &apos;t .
Don &apos;t make fun of children .
Can anyone tell me the time ?
I &apos;ve got some studying to do .
I don &apos;t feel like sleeping anymore .
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary is .
I know Tom is rich .
We never go to Boston anymore .
Tom is going to go to Australia .
Tom knew what he was doing .
He worked very hard .
No one takes us seriously .
I know why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
We &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
I &apos;m more than happy .
I learn French at school .
She has something in her hand .
You need a lot of water .
Let &apos;s take a rest .
What did Tom write ?
Tom asked me for help .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t invited to John &apos;s party .
I &apos;ve waited two whole hours . I can &apos;t wait any longer .
I &apos;d like to see what &apos;s going on .
Tom said Mary didn &apos;t know how to speak French .
He said that he would be back soon .
I am looking forward to seeing you next Sunday .
What happened to my suitcase ?
That &apos;s not exactly what happened .
It was dark and cold in the room .
Tom knows who we are .
He kept me waiting on purpose .
I don &apos;t think Tom has very long to live .
I look like my father .
We can &apos;t just give up on Tom .
I still love him .
I didn &apos;t have to tell Tom . He already knew .
I need a new shirt .
They were never alone .
Did you remember to do what I asked you to do ?
You can &apos;t just give up .
He must be crazy to do such a thing .
He said that if he had much money , he would buy the dictionary .
I never drink tea with milk .
What is it that you want from me ?
You don &apos;t need to do that if you don &apos;t want to .
We went to the park to play .
I have something else I want you to do for me .
I &apos;m not your girlfriend .
You must do the work , even if you do not like it .
I used to have that same problem .
I &apos;m just watching TV .
He doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
I don &apos;t want to go to school tomorrow .
I know what I &apos;ll do .
You &apos;re going to be fine .
It was to be expected .
You are too young to travel alone .
How much money does Tom owe you ?
The computer is in the library .
You &apos;ll all die .
I think I know what Tom is doing here .
Do you know something about this ?
Are you feeling a little better now ?
Can I do anything for you ?
It wasn &apos;t on purpose .
He said that if he were there , he would help her .
Tom doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom had to go himself .
Could I help you ?
How long do you have ?
It &apos;s expensive though .
Tom tried to save me .
Tom turned out to be right .
Tom has a kind heart .
Why was everyone so surprised ?
I don &apos;t care what others think about me .
Are you from the United States ?
Which do you prefer , rice or bread ?
Is it true that you changed your name ?
Tom won &apos;t discuss the problem with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t care .
&quot; Perhaps we &apos;d better not tell Tom anything about today . &quot; &quot; I agree . &quot;
One can always find time .
I didn &apos;t think Tom would be home .
We went without him since he wasn &apos;t ready .
You &apos;ll be busy tomorrow .
This is what I like about you .
I hate French .
You wouldn &apos;t happen to have a knife on you , would you ?
Tom has to be the last one to do that .
Everyone but Tom is wearing a hat .
It took her all afternoon to finish the work .
I know what it is .
That is her house .
Tom doesn &apos;t know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle .
He asked me to .
I almost feel bad for Tom .
I have already finished this book .
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants .
She can play the piano well .
Take a good look .
I slept very well last night .
Will you take it ?
Are you OK , Tom ?
It &apos;s still raining .
Tom needed that .
They &apos;re in love .
Don &apos;t move .
That book is worth reading .
I hope you know it doesn &apos;t really matter all that much .
Tom laughed , too .
You don &apos;t seem to be very happy .
Tom made a bad decision .
This school has many students .
I worked in Boston .
Did you say anything to Tom ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to tell Mary anything about himself .
I &apos;m not all that drunk .
Tom and I are going to be there .
I went to the hospital to see my wife .
I think I know why Tom didn &apos;t do that .
He won &apos;t pass the test .
There &apos;s a party after work .
I have time tomorrow morning .
He doesn &apos;t know much about Japan .
When is Tom coming ?
Tom tried to convince Mary that it was time to leave .
Tom and Mary want to know what &apos;s going on .
We &apos;re going to get married this summer .
I can &apos;t figure out how this happened .
Why exactly would you want to do that ?
I saw Tom on the stairs .
I &apos;m trying to work out this problem .
How long was Tom in the water ?
We don &apos;t know whether to believe Tom or not .
I saw you with a tall boy .
I love you .
Tom made us do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t think Mary is as pretty as Alice .
Tom is sometimes late for school .
My mother is making a cake for my father .
Tom and Mary have the same opinion .
Tom wasn &apos;t the first one to be fired .
Tom knows he has to do it .
Tom walked back into the house .
Tom is a Canadian living in Boston .
I saw your father .
That doesn &apos;t work at all .
I lost interest .
I should &apos;ve studied more .
This is a hotel .
Tom likes that .
Don &apos;t take things so seriously .
I &apos;ll enjoy this .
I like to play soccer .
Tom is taller than I am .
I understand why .
I can &apos;t tell you how happy I am that you &apos;ve come to visit us .
I &apos;ve got to do this .
Why would I fire you ?
It is already dark .
I &apos;ll watch it .
They &apos;re free .
It won &apos;t be a problem .
You had better not read this book .
I know nothing about her .
Tom and I enjoy swimming together .
Have you seen her ?
I did what Tom wanted me to do .
What &apos;s that about ?
We did all we could .
Tom wants to learn how to play the guitar .
Where did you get it ?
I love Boston .
That &apos;s not exactly true .
It was like that when I got it .
Tom is honest , isn &apos;t he ?
Take away this box .
Tom couldn &apos;t get in touch with Mary .
Tom , what are you doing in here ?
There was another problem .
Is it all right if I call you Tom ?
Will you let me try once more ?
I know the truth .
It &apos;s not a big thing .
Do you have a picture ?
As she was leaving me , she said that she would never forget me .
My French is still not very good .
Tom can &apos;t speak French .
Tom is doing fine in school .
I might be a little late .
You &apos;ll have a hard time .
What &apos;s Tom want ?
It &apos;s already seven o &apos;clock .
Where did I put my glasses ?
Please tell me when he &apos;ll arrive here .
Is everybody all right ?
We should do our best .
I don &apos;t know because I wasn &apos;t there .
Is that the best you can do ?
I saw it on TV .
This isn &apos;t helping .
I don &apos;t feel very lucky .
Tom said he thinks that you &apos;re stupid .
Is that really Tom &apos;s sister ?
Tom has no right to say that .
I didn &apos;t tell them .
Isn &apos;t that your car , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to like doing that .
I haven &apos;t seen you around here before .
I was alone in the classroom .
I &apos;m not going to be there .
It wasn &apos;t easy for him to keep his promise .
We shouldn &apos;t have gone there .
When will you ever learn ?
I tried standing on my head .
That man ate bread .
Everyone was drunk .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be a Canadian .
I guess Tom is sick .
I know Tom loves living here .
Tom can &apos;t make me do it .
I told you Tom wouldn &apos;t want to go .
I gave the book to my friend .
Tom is going to have to do it .
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me ?
I &apos;m sorry , but there &apos;s no other way .
We &apos;re back early .
We never expected it .
Are you mad ?
Aren &apos;t you going to miss Tom ?
We &apos;re all looking forward to it .
Do you like this color ?
I didn &apos;t even know you had a boyfriend .
Tom stood quickly .
Do you have a dog ?
They made me do it .
Tom isn &apos;t always late .
I think I &apos;ll take this one .
I broke that .
How did you get those ?
It &apos;s time we went home .
That &apos;s just the way he is .
Tom said he was looking for someone who speaks French .
I never realized how much I would miss you .
This tea isn &apos;t sweet enough for me .
What did you guys do ?
Tom seems honest .
I &apos;ll wait for you here .
We have waited for you the whole day .
Go for it .
How long ago was that ?
He is not honest at all .
Have you really talked to Tom ?
He &apos;s a teacher and so am I .
We gave our word .
When do you close ?
Tom must leave now .
Is this seat taken ?
She &apos;s in a good mood today .
After dinner , I did my homework .
I don &apos;t really understand French .
I don &apos;t think that Tom knows that I &apos;m Mary &apos;s brother .
How did you learn that Tom wasn &apos;t living in Boston ?
Don &apos;t ever do this again .
It &apos;s difficult to answer this question .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like dancing .
Why do you have this ?
Maybe you should &apos;ve told Tom the truth .
We &apos;ll get you out of here .
Tom is as tall as Mary .
Perhaps I will never see you again .
Tom said he takes a walk every day .
It &apos;s too dangerous .
I think we should take a break .
Tom is standing in front of Mary .
I like doing this .
Did you figure it out on your own ?
Are you satisfied with my explanation ?
She is a teacher .
Tom &apos;s older .
He &apos;s now on the phone .
What would you change ?
I have no idea where we are .
The bus stopped , but no one got out .
We &apos;ll meet right here .
They found something .
No one knows what to do .
What &apos;s your price ?
Tom is three years younger than Mary .
Will Tom be doing that anymore ?
You have to stop .
He doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
Tom has done it already .
I didn &apos;t know that he was there .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer all of the questions .
Tom already knows that .
Let Tom buy a new computer if he wants to .
This coffee is not hot enough .
Tom often makes mistakes .
It &apos;s no big thing .
This is our friend Tom .
I know that you know that I know .
I thought I told you never to call me while I &apos;m at the office .
That &apos;s what we &apos;d like to do .
No one likes you .
I &apos;m surprised you &apos;re still here .
Tom is working .
We can do a lot more .
I have to attend this class .
When can you start ?
I have lived here for six weeks .
They weren &apos;t there .
Tom was worried that he might lose his license .
I can &apos;t tell you what to do .
Who &apos;s your uncle ?
No one will do this .
We fight all the time .
We know everything you know .
Do you know how to use it ?
Tom wants way too much money .
Where did you hide my passport ?
I don &apos;t intend to have anything more to do with Tom .
Tom had expected something quite different .
Do you have any questions about the food ?
This book is new .
Tom probably isn &apos;t swimming now .
I wanted to know what happened .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
I can &apos;t explain it now .
What happened next ?
He plays the piano better than I do .
A deal is a deal .
I have something to give you .
Tom asked Mary to come home .
He no longer works here .
He isn &apos;t our enemy .
It &apos;s good to be back in Boston .
I can teach you how to write .
I am still waiting to be told what happened .
I &apos;ve been looking all over for Tom .
I guess everybody thinks that I &apos;m in love with Mary .
How long have you been learning French ?
I never expected to meet her in a place like that .
I am taller .
Tom wants that .
I have already read today &apos;s paper .
Do you think that Tom is happy ?
Tom tried to open the door .
I could have bought that for you .
Tom asked Mary why she was so mad .
Tom believes you .
I never heard you play it better .
We shouldn &apos;t have done this .
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up .
Will you give me something to drink ?
Tom has small hands .
You were absent from school yesterday .
My mother is in the hospital now .
Tom wants to learn how to ride a bike .
What &apos;s your wife &apos;s name ?
Can you tell me how ?
I &apos;ve been to Boston three times .
We &apos;ve decided to leave Boston .
I felt cold .
I thought you &apos;d want to see this .
I said what had to be said .
We &apos;re paid by the hour .
Tom should be back at 2 : 30 .
Tom wants to change .
I wanted to hurt Tom .
Tom has finished his work .
Where did everyone else go ?
Tom has already started .
I wish we had your problems .
You can count yourself lucky !
Tom has turned thirty .
Tom is afraid of his father .
I have a right to know .
It was hard for me to sell my guitar , but I needed the money .
I would never do anything like that .
I &apos;m going to be late .
Tom got out of his car .
That &apos;s the one we want .
I don &apos;t know anybody who can speak French .
When &apos;s the big day ?
I was hungry and so I asked Tom to make me something to eat .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to be very upset .
Tom can do what he likes .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Tom &apos;s fault .
What &apos;s Tom saying ?
I don &apos;t really like dogs all that much .
Tom has gone to the park .
May I have a look at it ?
Tom called me .
Where are they taking you ?
I &apos;m not in the office today .
Tom should &apos;ve been here .
I caught a big fish yesterday .
I &apos;ve got a class in a few minutes .
There is no doubt .
This bed is cold .
I wish Tom had never gotten out of prison .
I have never been to Boston .
The river is deep here .
You must go to school .
Don &apos;t forget anything .
He isn &apos;t able to buy a car .
Tom made this for Mary .
We &apos;ve got a lot of stuff left to do .
This is too difficult for me .
Are you going to go ?
I have a friend who loves me .
Tom couldn &apos;t find it .
This is all I can do .
They &apos;ll be looking for you .
What if Tom doesn &apos;t do that ?
Tom is going to like it .
Tom asked Mary if she &apos;d like a drink .
Tom lives alone in a small house near the river .
We laugh a lot .
You &apos;d better take this .
Where did you have the suit made ?
Tom arrived earlier than I did .
Please sit on this chair and wait .
My mother is at home .
I like to watch TV .
Tom is still there .
I don &apos;t even know your address .
We &apos;re waiting for Tom .
What makes you think Tom is here ?
You didn &apos;t eat very much .
Would you like to know how I did that ?
I have two brothers and one sister .
His proposal is not worth talking about .
Tom wanted to spend some time alone with Mary .
Tom looked down .
Can I be honest with you ?
It &apos;s all Tom &apos;s .
Everyone knows it &apos;s true .
He has no wife , no children and no friends .
I wonder why Tom does that .
What do you want me to tell Tom ?
The first was not the best .
I &apos;d like you to translate this report into French .
I don &apos;t want to go shopping today .
Tom asked me if he could use my computer .
Tom appears worried .
Can I speak to the doctor ?
I &apos;m not sure why they do that .
I enjoy working here .
Tom liked you .
He looks older than my brother .
She and I are the same age .
I don &apos;t want them .
This dress looks good on you .
I wish I had more to give you .
Do you want to go again ?
He was disappointed .
I want to go to another country .
Tom isn &apos;t a Canadian .
This car is as good as new .
I &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s time .
I &apos;m confused now .
Why won &apos;t Tom leave ?
He must be innocent .
I love this song .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t believe Mary would do that by herself .
I &apos;ll give you a call as soon as I know for sure .
Have you read this book already ?
Tom pretended like it never happened .
I &apos;m going to go shopping after lunch .
She likes music very much .
He played tennis .
Tom likes to play with my dog .
He doesn &apos;t know yet .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand what you said .
I hate everyone .
Tom and Mary are good people .
He lives near my house .
Let &apos;s see you do that .
They &apos;re in the garden .
Tom and Mary will be going home soon .
You &apos;ve done that already .
What are you doing here in Boston ?
I wish I could live in Boston .
The doctor called him back .
Tom wants you .
We have been here for three days .
Nothing can be done about it .
You don &apos;t like music .
Tom is short , but he &apos;s strong .
I hate that .
Are you new ?
I asked Mary to dance with me .
Tom is too good for you .
I guess both of us were lying .
I wonder why Tom is worried .
Tom stayed in Boston for three years .
You are a bad person .
Tom is going to know what to do .
Why do I have to do this alone ?
I believe I can help with that .
It was my first job .
That &apos;s all wrong .
She was already in love with him .
This is my dog .
Could we talk about last night ?
No one lived on the island at that time .
How many cats do you guys have ?
Why don &apos;t I have a girlfriend ?
I never see you without thinking of my mother .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you soon .
You shouldn &apos;t go there by yourself .
Are you as tall as me ?
I had better ask them .
Tom wants to be loved .
Tom is sick , but it isn &apos;t serious .
It &apos;s good to be in love .
Why do you care so much about what Tom thinks ?
&quot; Thank you . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re welcome . &quot;
I hear Tom does that .
I have another good idea .
Tom may change .
Tom &apos;s wife just died .
Is it near here ?
Tom should &apos;ve stayed at home .
This book is too difficult for me to understand .
He went to sleep at six o &apos;clock and he is still sleeping .
Where does Tom go from here ?
You have to give me more time .
We should &apos;ve stayed in Australia until Monday .
I already talked to this student .
How is Tom today ?
Tom drove Mary to work yesterday .
Tom grew up in a small town in Australia .
I have enough money .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t need money .
We don &apos;t have the money .
Get over here .
Everyone is interested in that .
I want you to do what you have to do .
He could swim fast enough to pass the test .
It didn &apos;t seem to matter .
You like me , don &apos;t you ?
It was fine all day .
You should get married again .
You should wash your hands before you eat .
I was tired so I went to bed .
You may go home now .
Tom tried hard , but failed .
I &apos;d better go home .
I didn &apos;t lie .
I am going to see the doctor this afternoon .
I don &apos;t know how else to explain it .
Who &apos;s going ?
I &apos;d like to talk about your situation .
He is tall , but his brother is much taller .
Let me go !
I know a lot of languages .
Why should Tom visit Boston ?
I gave him a few books .
He couldn &apos;t bring himself to believe her story .
You must come back before nine o &apos;clock .
Tom knows we aren &apos;t happy .
Tom laughed at all of Mary &apos;s jokes .
I agree with what you &apos;ve written .
This dictionary doesn &apos;t belong to me .
I thought Tom would never stop talking .
Who did you go swimming with ?
I think you look hot .
Tom said he may do that .
May I borrow that book from you ?
Is there a cat under the table ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good or bad .
I hope Tom isn &apos;t doing something he isn &apos;t supposed to be doing .
I &apos;d better get to bed soon .
&quot; Do you have a dog ? &quot; &quot; No . &quot;
You have to hurry .
I &apos;d like to say a few words .
I &apos;m not going to the movies tomorrow .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
It &apos;s time to go to sleep .
He couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom has been single all his life .
If only I could speak English !
I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll see Tom again .
They live in another country .
I know you are rich .
Tom and I want to get married .
Tom comes here every other day .
Tom didn &apos;t want to sit next to me .
The cat drinks milk .
I can &apos;t believe your mom let you go .
Tom asked Mary to stay , but she had to get back to work .
I &apos;ve been here for hours .
I know who lives in that house .
Do you have any money ?
I love this game .
I have to be in Australia next Monday .
Come to us .
I can &apos;t remember the last time I was this happy .
Tom has just bought a new computer .
I thought you &apos;d never visit us again .
I can &apos;t remember his name .
Tom felt alone .
We have something else in common .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father , but her uncle .
I played with my brother .
You don &apos;t have to go .
Tom stayed at home alone .
Tom was better than I expected .
Tom stayed here .
We must go to school .
I wish I &apos;d had more time to do that .
He was very old .
I went straight to bed .
How will you help Tom ?
He will walk .
He sometimes comes to see me .
That would be nice .
He thought that it would be interesting and fun .
It &apos;s been seven years since we got married .
Does it need to be this way ?
She is no longer what she used to be .
Don &apos;t be like that .
Do you think in French ?
That wasn &apos;t funny .
Do it for me .
It doesn &apos;t sound like Tom .
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room .
Leave it there .
Don &apos;t talk to me while I &apos;m working .
My sister often takes care of the baby .
Are you telling me how to do my job ?
That &apos;s important .
I &apos;m having fun .
Do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
He found a ball in the garden .
Tom said he thought that it could happen in Boston , too .
We &apos;ll have to do something .
When did he go ?
Tom got very nervous .
You know that I &apos;m right .
That is our father .
Why is everybody so worried about Tom ?
I &apos;ve visited Boston three times .
It &apos;s all very new to me .
Today &apos;s not Christmas .
Tom wants to ask us a few questions .
I &apos;m better .
Isn &apos;t his name Tom ?
Tom might walk to school tomorrow .
When are we going to do it ?
It looks like an apple .
I finally have enough money to buy Tom that camera he &apos;s wanted .
Tom hasn &apos;t been living here long .
I need your help .
You &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
I didn &apos;t know that song .
No one &apos;s watching .
I &apos;m doing this for them .
Tom was lying on the couch .
What country were you born in ?
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is busy or not .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me why he did that .
Ask him his name .
You live too far away .
Tom said that he could swim well .
Tom didn &apos;t even love Mary .
If I had money , I could buy it .
I &apos;ll be back at ten .
It was your idea .
Tom says he can fix anything .
I can &apos;t believe Tom still talks with you .
What should Tom do ?
Tom may go to Boston next week .
What are you writing ?
I don &apos;t think I like that .
We tried .
I &apos;ll drive you home .
I hear something .
Do you have a driver &apos;s license ?
We know each other pretty well .
Tom will work .
I &apos;ve never done it like that before .
I will give you ten minutes to work out this problem .
This is nothing .
It &apos;s going to be good .
Tom wasn &apos;t the first person to ask me that question .
Ask Tom to apologize to Mary .
All great men are dead and I am not feeling too well myself .
I am glad to see her .
This suitcase is too heavy for you .
I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s after 2 : 30 .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like me .
You know enough .
Is that the map that Tom gave you ?
The only time Tom seems to be happy is when he &apos;s with Mary .
This book is full of mistakes .
There &apos;s no mistake .
I &apos;m very , very happy .
I was tired , so I didn &apos;t do that .
All you care about is money .
You should not go there .
We &apos;ll take Tom home .
You &apos;ve got my keys .
Do you have a book ?
I wonder if I could talk with you for a moment .
When is he coming back ?
I only just left Tom .
I did it the way he told me to .
I &apos;ll see to it immediately .
My friends don &apos;t know where I am .
What made you think that ?
One box is still missing .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
Today is a good day .
Would you like to go with me ?
It turned out that their office had a lot of women .
I live in an apartment .
Be nice to others .
I can &apos;t do what you want .
I think you &apos;re nice .
Tom has stopped smoking .
Would you please leave ?
Tom was sitting behind me .
No one lives here .
This one &apos;s broken .
Please don &apos;t be mad .
It &apos;s not likely that Tom did that on purpose .
Please tell me how to get to the airport .
I work at the post office .
Tom hid under the table .
They don &apos;t have to know .
It &apos;s close to my house .
I &apos;m kind of happy .
I wrote a book about China .
Who was that girl you were with at the beach today ?
They &apos;re not always there .
I don &apos;t do those things .
I haven &apos;t met any woman I wanted to be married to .
We &apos;ll go home .
Tom had a nice bicycle .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me you were here .
He is having coffee now .
Why aren &apos;t you at school ?
The old man said something .
I did that on purpose .
You must hurry up .
You &apos;re too young to die .
Tom asked me if I were happy .
I wish I could remember his name .
How do I fix this problem ?
Would you like to go ?
Here we are again .
I didn &apos;t know any of them .
She didn &apos;t like him .
We &apos;re not going to do it .
I think I understood everything Tom said , but I &apos;m not absolutely sure .
Tom did nothing .
We know what happened to Tom &apos;s car .
I think we should visit Boston .
I drank a lot and can &apos;t remember much of what happened last night .
You shouldn &apos;t have bought that .
I need help .
I couldn &apos;t speak .
This car is too expensive .
Tom said he &apos;d be back soon .
He can &apos;t cook very well .
We all speak French .
I shouldn &apos;t worry .
Tom told me a secret .
I don &apos;t actually believe that .
I understand your language .
This isn &apos;t the first time that this has happened to me .
His name is known to everyone in this town .
We are brother and sister .
Tom asked Mary to open the window , but she wouldn &apos;t .
You &apos;ve known Tom longer than any of us .
Tom and I had coffee together .
Have you ever spoken to Tom ?
Take that box away !
Mary is beautiful .
There are too many people in the park .
I went swimming last Monday .
How could this have happened ?
He took her by the hand .
Tom and I aren &apos;t likely to ever see each other again .
It &apos;s hard to believe that Tom really did that .
Maybe we should just give up .
It &apos;s not his idea , it &apos;s mine .
It may save your life .
I could have died tonight .
Please say something .
I might be able to answer that question .
You &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
What &apos;s his name ?
Where have you been , Tom ?
He wants to work in a hospital .
I told Tom not to use those .
I think that Tom should stay .
Let &apos;s go get some food .
Tom gave Mary something she needed .
Tom is happy , isn &apos;t he ?
She wants to buy her boyfriend a present .
Tom is watching golf .
I don &apos;t have a telephone .
You shouldn &apos;t have let everyone know how angry you were .
He was hurt in the accident .
Tom said he was afraid .
It &apos;ll work for sure .
He can no longer wait .
I haven &apos;t spoken French in three years .
How long have you known me ?
Tom isn &apos;t here anymore .
I wonder whether or not Tom has a driver &apos;s license .
Tom &apos;s radio is broken .
That small one is also mine .
She may have been beautiful when she was young .
Tom said he &apos;d look at it .
I am very glad to see you .
When and where did you buy that old clock ?
Tell me where you &apos;re going .
I was born the year the war ended .
It just didn &apos;t work .
They don &apos;t want you . They want Tom .
I don &apos;t know where I am .
Tom got Mary drunk .
I need to know who you are .
I don &apos;t like kids .
What did you do during the summer when you were a kid ?
This used to be Tom &apos;s home .
We have a lot more work to do before we can go home .
I thought you were my best friend .
Tom told his friends that he was going to Boston .
I &apos;ve got some questions for you .
People here love you .
It &apos;s right over here .
It was the truth .
Tom is in Boston with his parents .
Can I leave now ?
Tom sat down on the bed .
Leave it right where it is .
You &apos;re my friend .
I often played soccer when I was young .
Is it true what they &apos;re saying about Tom ?
You better go .
Please write to me as soon as possible .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
I almost caught the fish .
Tom isn &apos;t poor .
Tom is standing behind Mary in this picture .
Please do that now .
Take us there , Tom .
Tom has a really nice voice .
Tom said he didn &apos;t think that Mary really needed to do that .
We haven &apos;t done a thing all week .
Tom never wears a tie .
Tom might be impressed .
I want to buy my children everything I never had .
It is something my mother made .
Everyone was looking at me .
He is as tall as my father .
Who could forget it ?
I have nothing to say on this matter .
Tom &apos;s computer is broken .
I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow .
Tom said he &apos;d be home for dinner .
I hate the world because the world hates me .
It &apos;s not that cold .
Where are you hurt ?
People are dying .
Don &apos;t open that door for anybody .
I &apos;ll read this book .
Tom read it for me .
He &apos;s looking at me .
I ate too much yesterday .
Tom couldn &apos;t answer the last question .
We were a little tired .
It &apos;ll be hard to convince Tom to help us .
May I open the window ?
Let Tom do this .
I don &apos;t know where we are .
What can I do for you ?
The party was almost over .
I didn &apos;t know Tom had a brother .
I don &apos;t like your dad .
You &apos;re much faster than I am .
I must go . It &apos;s getting dark .
Tom waited a good hour for Mary .
It doesn &apos;t look very fun , does it ?
I have to call my father .
I won &apos;t let you escape .
Were you up all night ?
I &apos;ve got to get out of here .
Give them a couple of minutes .
What can we do next ?
Tom didn &apos;t study French yesterday .
Do you know where my watch is ?
We &apos;re going to be here all day .
Tom &apos;s suitcase looks very heavy .
I didn &apos;t find everything I needed .
She likes sleeping .
It &apos;s my horse .
I think Tom wants our help .
Her father died .
I heard about it .
Is there any other way I can pay you ?
Can I have some of these ?
Which is mine ?
I &apos;m pretty sure about it .
I usually agree with her .
The party was over at nine .
He was playing the piano .
What are these people doing ?
Do you know Tom &apos;s father &apos;s name ?
How do you do it ?
That was years ago .
I need to buy food , but I don &apos;t have enough money .
I can teach you how to drive .
There &apos;s so much I want to show you .
They aren &apos;t all bad .
My father is in the garden now .
I knew there was nothing you could do about it .
I &apos;d like to become a doctor .
You really should &apos;ve told Tom not to come .
We &apos;re not good enough .
Tom knows why Mary did that .
I won &apos;t ask you for help anymore .
What did Tom do ?
I &apos;m going to Boston on Monday .
Tom and I are getting married .
Tom lives abroad .
I can wait .
That was a good decision .
You should probably go .
It seems that Tom might win .
Don &apos;t play ball in this room .
I like the people here .
Do you know how much Tom gets paid to do that ?
Tom isn &apos;t worried .
I wonder if what I wrote was correct .
He is her friend .
Some people speak from experience , and some people , from experience , don &apos;t speak .
Tom didn &apos;t come until 2 : 30 .
Both of my brothers are married .
Isn &apos;t Tom supposed to be the boss ?
You &apos;ll miss me when I &apos;m gone .
Tom hates himself .
You know it &apos;s not good .
It &apos;s not time to go home yet .
I think Tom speaks French well .
How are things in Australia ?
Can I have something to eat ?
I &apos;ll do anything you say .
Some people just never learn .
Do you know where my key is ?
We have only one chance .
I can &apos;t let you use that .
A man must work .
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday .
I think it won &apos;t rain this afternoon .
He took his book .
Tom is worried .
What does Tom &apos;s new car look like ?
Tom is not happy to be here .
It &apos;ll be a big day .
Tom will tell us .
I like this color .
Don &apos;t come again .
He is rich enough to buy that car .
Tom isn &apos;t quiet .
That &apos;s my umbrella , not Tom &apos;s .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you as well .
She refused his offer .
Why me ?
What is the cat up to ?
Tom and Mary are playing with John &apos;s cat .
Do you like my new hat ?
Tom has what he wants .
Tom came by car .
Tom stayed home .
I went to drink a beer with friends .
I &apos;ll come by .
I know I &apos;m going to die .
Is this true ?
She was sad for the first time in months .
Your house is big .
Stop calling me Tom .
When he came , I was writing a letter .
I &apos;m getting hot .
It could &apos;ve happened to anyone .
It &apos;s not yours .
The car doesn &apos;t run fast .
Don &apos;t listen to Tom .
Tom can &apos;t stand Mary .
It was a gift .
Tom said nobody had been injured .
Do you know that person ?
You &apos;d better go home .
I &apos;m not feeling well .
Tom is back again .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in days .
What &apos;s Tom listening to ?
Do you think you can fix that ?
Do you like cats ?
What would &apos;ve happened if Tom had seen us ?
Today is not your day .
You &apos;re not going to understand it .
I &apos;m quite satisfied .
You can &apos;t always have your own way .
Nobody likes war .
Which bed do I sleep in ?
Why is that good ?
Your father won &apos;t buy it .
I was tired today so I went to bed early .
I &apos;d be careful .
It has to be me .
I don &apos;t need anything .
We know what we &apos;re doing .
I would like to do something else today .
You &apos;re afraid of him .
What do you want to drink ?
The boss wants to see you .
She visited him once a year .
I &apos;d like to spend some time with my daughter .
The only language Tom can speak is French .
I stay home alone while my parents are at work .
What &apos;s this noise ?
I &apos;ll tell you .
I want to sleep a little longer .
It won &apos;t take me a long time .
She was my first girlfriend .
Tom is a little older than the rest of the students in his class .
Nobody wants to do that .
Tom goes to school .
If it were not for your help , I could not succeed .
Tom ought to do that .
I &apos;ll tell you right now that Tom won &apos;t know the answer .
When do you want to meet Tom ?
Tom said that he didn &apos;t believe Mary would really do that .
You have a thing for Mary , don &apos;t you ?
There are many books on this subject .
He gave him a book .
I &apos;ve heard all this before .
It &apos;s now time for me to go to bed .
Are you hungry yet ?
Tom told me what he wanted .
Did Tom send you ?
Tom is afraid of me .
Now you do it .
Don &apos;t look at Tom . Look at me .
Why are you angry ?
You really don &apos;t need to do that .
I like working with you .
I haven &apos;t understood anything that you &apos;ve said .
Mary is as pretty as Alice .
I wish that were the case .
Everyone has a right to say what he thinks .
Tom didn &apos;t need the money .
Do you want to be near Tom ?
I want to know what it is .
When I saw his mother yesterday , she said he had left the hospital a week before .
Tom will never believe me again .
Your brother will not buy it .
He won &apos;t be in time for the meeting .
There &apos;s no other way to say this .
I was in prison for three years .
He &apos;s still at work .
We &apos;ll do what we have to do .
We don &apos;t even know each other .
I know a good place for dinner .
He doesn &apos;t watch TV at all .
Tom drives .
Maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that .
Please do as I say .
We &apos;ll eat as soon as Tom gets here .
Tom needed food .
I want to read that book .
They might be older than us .
I know why Tom wants to do that .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t stay long .
I didn &apos;t know that dogs swim well .
They started the meeting without me .
Tom says he &apos;s busy .
You know where to find me if you need anything .
Is this the reason you didn &apos;t want to come with me ?
Tom went on doing what he was doing .
I think we have to be very careful .
Tom lost again .
Tom bought another hat .
He &apos;s not perfect .
He should have kept his mouth shut .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom has already made up his mind .
Tom didn &apos;t buy any bread .
I wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
I met him on the street .
I thought you said Tom was dangerous .
I &apos;m older than you think .
Tom got a present from Mary .
Where did you buy that ?
I know that you &apos;re innocent .
What did they say ?
Tom saw Mary .
Tom went shopping .
I &apos;m sorry , but I already have a boyfriend .
I read this book a couple of years ago .
The restaurant was far from the train station .
You should let Tom win .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that .
It wasn &apos;t very good .
It &apos;s just what I needed .
His old cat is still alive .
This is the house I live in .
Tom said he enjoyed it .
Where &apos;s Tom going ?
Where &apos;s the ball ?
I really do miss my parents a lot .
I don &apos;t want to be with you .
I &apos;ll be by later .
He stopped talking .
She &apos;s from France .
I think Tom is looking for us .
I asked the doctor some questions .
Who told Tom that ?
Tom and Mary only speak French to their children .
What did you bring ?
That &apos;s really a great idea .
Nobody spoke with me .
I love walking on the beach .
Tom told me he didn &apos;t take French in high school .
That didn &apos;t help very much .
I &apos;ve never been this happy before .
Tom is looking good .
Tom was running .
She is too young to go to school .
Tom married into money .
I &apos;m satisfied with everything .
I haven &apos;t met him .
That &apos;s for you .
Tom seems to like Boston .
Do not look out the window .
What would Tom say if he were here ?
You look like a girl .
The bag is full .
Why are you washing your hands ?
I really have to go now .
Why aren &apos;t you friends with Tom ?
This chair is too small .
You don &apos;t look well .
I &apos;d love to know everything about you .
He has always understood our problems right away .
How long do you think it takes to go from here to Tokyo ?
I live about three hours from Boston .
I &apos;m calling Tom .
My phone doesn &apos;t work .
I wish it would stop raining .
I &apos;m not as smart as you .
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river .
I think I can handle this myself .
Tom is going to do that for me .
What train you are going to take ?
We bought this in Australia .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting along .
It &apos;s about time .
It &apos;s a beautiful day .
She didn &apos;t say a word .
I agree with their plan .
Aren &apos;t you going to come ?
I don &apos;t like studying .
Tom pretended everything was OK .
Some of the dogs are alive .
I can &apos;t live on my own .
What do you usually wear to work ?
Tom says that he didn &apos;t study at all for the test .
I don &apos;t know anything about it at all .
It &apos;s not a good idea to ask a woman how old she is .
&quot; Are you upset ? &quot; &quot; No . Why would I be ? &quot;
Tom isn &apos;t busy .
You &apos;re the one that I was looking for .
I want one !
There seems no doubt about it .
She came back in about thirty minutes .
It &apos;s still dark .
Tom said that he was hungry .
Can you please give me something to do ?
What do you do after work ?
What have you ever done for us ?
Why do you guys always fight ?
Tom really likes talking .
This question is too difficult for me to answer .
This is my cat .
You killed my father .
This was your idea .
It &apos;s up to you .
Tom tried to leave , but Mary wouldn &apos;t let him .
He goes to school on foot .
I like fish better than meat .
I &apos;m not feeling so good .
Tom couldn &apos;t believe that no one laughed at his jokes .
Tom isn &apos;t there , is he ?
My grandmother speaks slowly .
Tom knows nothing about Boston .
We won &apos;t be going to Tom &apos;s party .
What are you two up to ?
Are you still at home ?
We didn &apos;t do anything .
We need to do a better job .
I have no idea who Tom is .
Tom can &apos;t do that very well .
Please sit down .
I don &apos;t have to answer your questions .
Tom wears a suit almost every day .
Are you being paid for doing this ?
Why is everyone afraid of Tom ?
I told her that she was right .
I wish that I could give you something .
The young boy helped the old woman .
I fear so .
Have you ever been to London ?
My sister is crazy about tennis .
Tom is better today than yesterday .
Do you know me ?
I am going to take two days off next week .
I think this is yours .
Tom would &apos;ve been thirty years old today if he hadn &apos;t passed away last year .
Do you know anything about his family ?
It &apos;s just not enough .
That &apos;s better .
Who killed Tom ?
Tom is able to play the guitar .
Tom agreed .
What did you do last Sunday ?
I just wanted to say that I love you .
I don &apos;t know what I did wrong .
Tom came to save me .
May I have a cup of tea , please ?
I &apos;ll give these to Tom .
I don &apos;t care for eggs .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will be here .
There must be some solution to the problem .
Come on in here .
Why do you ask that ?
What did you buy for your boyfriend ?
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question .
Tom couldn &apos;t keep his eyes off of Mary .
Where were your parents ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Tom liked that .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
They will understand .
I need this money .
Do people in Australia eat a lot of meat ?
Tom made noise .
Everyone in town knows his name .
I really don &apos;t feel like seeing Tom .
Tom sat on the bench .
Tom hates dancing .
I am tired because I had to study for this exam last night .
Are you sure you won &apos;t change your mind ?
They &apos;ll want Tom .
I remember reading that book .
I &apos;m hit !
She didn &apos;t tell me her name .
Tom isn &apos;t sick .
You don &apos;t understand me .
You really must see that movie .
Tom wouldn &apos;t come .
Tom isn &apos;t a good student .
Do you like French ?
Tom said that he and Mary can &apos;t come to our party .
Tom likes helping others .
It is dangerous to play in the street .
I don &apos;t feel safe here anymore .
We &apos;ll all be dead in thirty years .
Is Boston a big city ?
I don &apos;t want to leave Boston .
I want you to go there with Tom .
I always thought Tom and Mary would get married .
I can &apos;t leave until I &apos;ve found out how Tom is .
I hate Boston .
You look a lot older than Tom .
I happened to be in Boston at that time .
I haven &apos;t got it yet .
I don &apos;t know what to do about Tom .
Tom wants to do that .
A solution had to be found .
You can &apos;t buy anything if you have no money .
I go to work every day .
Tom didn &apos;t need to wait very long .
We &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
We were best friends .
He doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
I spent all day thinking about Tom .
Tom probably doesn &apos;t know Mary &apos;s phone number .
Are you sure you &apos;re not hurt ?
Tom broke his word .
Is Tom coming with us ?
I hope I made the right decision .
It &apos;s hot here .
My kids have all left school .
We can &apos;t wait that long .
Do you have a child ?
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
Perhaps you &apos;re trying too hard .
&quot; What day is today ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Monday . &quot;
Who quit ?
I think we can be friends .
French is the language of love .
Tom thinks it &apos;s important for Mary to learn how to speak French .
He found the box under the table .
We knew one day it would happen .
That ended better than I expected .
Where can I find him ?
Even Tom knows that .
I &apos;m a good teacher .
They must be Americans .
Would you like sugar and milk ?
May I go to the river ?
It wasn &apos;t a dream .
He told her something and she smiled .
I &apos;m proud of my son .
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary .
How long have you been married to Tom ?
I did it .
Tom asked Mary if dinner was ready .
I would like to be alone .
We want our kids to be safe .
What &apos;re Tom and Mary doing here ?
They were able to do it on their own .
All of us are happy .
I think you should eat something .
I wish I could buy that guitar .
There is no future in his job .
She &apos;s not old enough to get a driver &apos;s license .
Here &apos;s what I don &apos;t get .
Tom loves cats .
Tom doesn &apos;t know the whole story .
I thought I heard music .
It won &apos;t be easy .
Is dinner ready ?
What is the matter with you ?
Tom will help Mary tomorrow .
You &apos;re the first person I told that to .
That &apos;s very , very good .
Tom didn &apos;t think he could trust Mary .
That was very funny .
Do you have an address ?
I can teach you a thing or two .
We actually saw the accident .
Everybody ran outside .
I want a new dress .
They &apos;re still young .
Tom will be here next week .
I live near the sea so I often get to go to the beach .
I &apos;ve never heard of him before .
I &apos;d rather not go home .
Do they know ?
How did you come by all this money ?
I &apos;m taking off .
Tom can talk .
Tom said he &apos;d wait .
I waited for Tom all afternoon .
Tom was the only one in the house .
Why can &apos;t we just go home ?
I &apos;ve studied French for three years .
I don &apos;t want an apple .
I got mad .
Don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going on ?
I wish I &apos;d been born a Canadian .
I &apos;ll go and see Tom .
What part of Boston does Tom live in ?
Tom works too much .
You do not look well .
Tom always wears a suit to work .
Tom finished .
I told you Tom was busy .
This book is very new .
I like living with you .
It &apos;s time to sleep .
This one is for us .
I &apos;ll give you a good price .
Go see Tom .
Can he see us ?
Tom has a picture of his wife on his desk .
I wanted to work this summer .
She stood by him .
I &apos;ll go to Boston to be with family .
Tom will be happy to show you the way .
No one has that right .
Tom didn &apos;t catch any fish .
You don &apos;t know a thing about me .
Tom was famous .
It is hardly raining .
Tom can &apos;t stand people like that .
I do hope so .
What &apos;s going on out there ?
Take Tom outside .
I want to stay a few days .
A book not worth reading is not worth buying in the first place .
Tom is good at doing that , isn &apos;t he ?
I know Tom did it on purpose .
I would like to play golf .
I thought I &apos;d go with Tom .
She has been sick in bed for a week .
He won &apos;t make it .
Tom can speak French .
Tom does what he wants .
You should &apos;ve told me a few days ago .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come .
It was so simple .
I know that some of your students don &apos;t like you .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like me .
I &apos;m with my family right now .
Everything was so beautiful .
I say it all the time .
Is it a boy or a girl ?
Is there anything else I can help you with ?
I &apos;ll be there in a couple of hours .
Do you want to drink anything ?
I want to come , too .
Tom asked me out this weekend .
Tom is going to take care of Mary &apos;s dog while she &apos;s on vacation .
I can &apos;t wait until tomorrow .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m not that hungry right now .
Tom told me .
I didn &apos;t believe Tom when he said he loved me .
You can go anywhere you want .
She seldom , if ever , goes to movies by herself .
I am afraid you have the wrong number .
We all have things we don &apos;t want to tell others about .
You know that &apos;s the truth .
I &apos;m going to go there .
What time do you finish school ?
I &apos;m never going to Boston again .
I have read this book before .
He was alone at the time .
Tom came to visit .
Tom is full of hope .
Tom is a Canadian .
I need to ask you something .
You &apos;ll have to come with me .
I &apos;ll go with Tom .
It is too good to be true .
What a beautiful town !
Tom wants to learn French .
What do you think of Tom ?
I speak from experience .
You &apos;re too young to understand .
Tom didn &apos;t remember where he &apos;d put his passport .
I &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
I have no idea where we are or where we &apos;re going .
Tom brought us each a gift .
Tom never said anything about where he &apos;d been .
We &apos;re all right .
We &apos;ve upset Tom .
She is about my age .
Tom waited there .
Tom heard Mary crying .
Maybe he &apos;ll come tomorrow .
The cat is not dead .
I &apos;ll give it to you .
Look up there .
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s late .
Tom thought that Mary was in Boston .
I didn &apos;t see anyone writing .
Here , drink this .
Tom is always making me angry .
When did he come here ?
That isn &apos;t the case in Japan .
Tom saw Mary doing that .
He has enough money .
You don &apos;t have to do that , but you should .
He has a family to support .
I want you to like Tom .
Give it a shot .
Is your father a doctor ?
Tom looks tired this morning .
The check , please .
Just do it .
She did pretty well .
He was made to wait at the station for two hours .
There is no reason for me to apologize .
I should be done in an hour .
Tom told Mary to go home .
I &apos;m not sure , but I think I hate Tom .
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road .
Tom said he thought he &apos;d be able to do that today .
This is serious .
Tom said he &apos;s Canadian .
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well .
I made tea .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
Do you plan to buy that car ?
You can &apos;t leave yet .
Tom can speak a little French .
I thought Tom was a Canadian .
Tom is at school now .
I wish I had listened to your advice .
Tom used to help his father in the store after school .
Tom has been found guilty .
That car is really expensive .
I feel guilty about it .
It appears to me that you are right .
Tom lived in that small house for a little over ten years .
I don &apos;t like those shoes .
I don &apos;t know if you remember me , but we met a couple of years ago in Boston .
I do not love him any longer .
I asked Tom what he &apos;d do .
She is very proud of her daughter .
I don &apos;t want Tom to go to Boston .
I do not like music .
I don &apos;t want to be alone anymore .
Tom is outside .
Why didn &apos;t you think of that before ?
When are we eating ? I &apos;m hungry !
I wonder why Tom doesn &apos;t like me .
Tom is watching the news .
Thanks for the offer .
Does Tom have a key ?
What makes you happy makes me happy .
I play tennis every Sunday .
My mom is worried .
The store might be closed already .
This is your chance .
I &apos;m right and everybody else is wrong .
I have met her before .
He &apos;s very young . He &apos;s much younger than Tom .
Tom seems to be rich .
You &apos;re welcome to move back to Boston .
You might not want to go there by yourself .
Tom fell out of the tree .
You will find this game very interesting .
Tom &apos;s died .
I never actually wanted to go there .
He has a good heart .
I can &apos;t remember who I am .
I &apos;ll be there on Monday .
When did you work in Boston ?
She &apos;s younger than him .
He is lying on the sofa .
If I &apos;d known where Tom was , I &apos;d have told you .
His brother goes to school by bus .
Where &apos;s the doctor ?
I take a walk with my dog in the evening .
Tom had never been so busy before .
You &apos;re very lucky .
Tom was in the house .
I worked all night .
Aren &apos;t you guys having any fun ?
How do I get there ?
This is crazy .
You &apos;re better at this than I am .
What are you guys doing here ?
I &apos;m having lunch with my sister right now .
He can speak 10 languages .
I can &apos;t go alone .
I &apos;m thirty now .
I &apos;ll go out after having dinner .
What is in the box ?
Tom is as tall as me .
Tom sounds sad .
He hit me twice .
It &apos;s not my day .
Thanks for coming .
Everyone is confused .
Tom often comes to Boston .
Stop reading .
I told the police everything I know .
I think you &apos;d better go and visit him .
She was afraid of the dog .
Do you know how to do this ?
Is he American ?
I got out of the taxi .
There &apos;s not much difference between the two .
How can it be ?
I &apos;m going to give you something .
What did you say his name was ?
Tom is always getting people to do things for him .
It was not very cold yesterday .
Do you know how Tom is doing ?
Tom said he &apos;d like to have another cup of coffee .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
He has a little money .
Be kind to those around you .
Tom got you in trouble , didn &apos;t he ?
He is able to swim very fast .
Tom has known Mary for close to ten years .
I know more than you think .
How many cars does Tom have ?
Can you see Tom ?
It almost didn &apos;t happen .
Tom wants a job .
I want you to be ready when Tom gets here .
What you said surprised me .
Tom wants to sleep on the beach .
He was too tired to study .
This is a dress that Mary made by herself .
I would really like to learn more about your country .
&quot; Who is the guy in the picture ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know who he is . &quot;
Do you like going to work ?
That pretty girl is my sister .
I knew you &apos;d go there .
I didn &apos;t know Tom was that old .
We &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
I remember that I closed the door .
Please call a taxi for me .
When my mother was young , she was very beautiful .
How well can you dance ?
I haven &apos;t yet finished my homework .
Her answer couldn &apos;t be understood .
We don &apos;t know her .
I sat down on the couch next to Tom .
She sat next to him on the bus .
That &apos;s what people say .
It will be raining at this time tomorrow .
You may go home .
Tell me what we &apos;re doing here .
I &apos;m not used to going to bed late .
There is no school today .
I wasn &apos;t here yesterday .
Tom and John look like brothers .
My father is a doctor .
A nice day , isn &apos;t it ? Why not go out for a walk ?
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary .
What are we to do ?
Nobody was helping us .
I just wanted to see what would happen .
Do you want Tom to do that for you ?
Tom met with an accident .
I don &apos;t believe in life after death .
Tom is still just a kid .
Tom has been in Boston since last Monday .
Tom may do whatever he likes with what I gave him .
I don &apos;t want to hear it .
I saw Tom in there .
I am too short .
I think Tom knows French .
He began singing .
Did you talk to Tom about it ?
Tom seemed ready .
We &apos;re clean .
We were friends .
Tom first met Mary in Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t lost .
Isn &apos;t Tom funny ?
He has gone to America .
I &apos;ve already said no .
I &apos;m not sure I want that .
Tom will like it .
We can still learn a lot from Tom .
Do you know when she will come ?
Her husband is American .
I &apos;d rather not eat right now .
I love animals .
Do you know how Tom does that ?
