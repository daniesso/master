Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do before I leave .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d want from you .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked all over for Tom , but I can &apos;t find him .
Is he going to make it ?
That hurts ! Stop it !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy when you know the rules .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary died on Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you need to cook this a bit longer .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call while I was out ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats sleeping on the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you could come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house all to myself .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom sat as far from the door as possible .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my brothers and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very glad .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman took the knife from the boy .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows things that we don &apos;t .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary , but she didn &apos;t smile back .
You read too much .
All of them swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there that you don &apos;t see .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat less than my boyfriend .
What are you going as ?
There &apos;s very little paper left .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill , but today he &apos;s all right .
