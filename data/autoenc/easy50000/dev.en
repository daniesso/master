Tom will find Mary .
How exactly can I help you ?
Is that what it takes ?
We just got back from Boston .
No one knows anything .
What &apos;s wrong with yours ?
It &apos;s hardly raining at all .
This cake is sweet .
Tom knows how to read people .
She became more and more beautiful as she grew older .
There are some things that I don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m a Canadian .
Tom should &apos;ve finished at least an hour ago .
Would you like to hear about what I did last summer ?
I can afford it .
I guess all we can do is wait .
I want to study abroad .
You worked more than I did .
I &apos;ll probably never do that again .
Do you think that &apos;s true ?
We need to help Tom .
This book is too difficult for me .
I want to do that .
I &apos;m absolutely sure that &apos;s what Tom needs .
Is Tom busy ?
He doesn &apos;t yet know the truth .
Tom gets up early every morning .
Tom said he knew you .
You need a new hat .
I have to keep trying .
I did that already .
Tom is on his way here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to come .
Tom lost his job last month .
I like playing tennis and golf .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t married .
I think this one is good .
Tom said that he decided it was too difficult to do .
Tom has to work late every night this week .
I just want to get some sleep .
That wouldn &apos;t have happened here .
I was very disappointed at the news .
Mary was impressed with what she saw .
I will see them next week .
Did Tom eat ?
I don &apos;t know a lot of jokes .
As a matter of fact , he did it by himself .
He entered the room after you left .
Tom didn &apos;t see it .
Can we afford all this ?
Tom is doing a good job .
I can sing it in English .
Tom was not impressed .
I tried to help .
This watch is broken .
Did you enjoy it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve done .
Tom decided to become a teacher .
Whose car is this ?
I know where he lives .
I wanted to learn French .
I thought you &apos;d be busy helping Tom .
This does not make me happy .
We knew all about it .
Tom isn &apos;t really in love with Mary .
I told you I didn &apos;t want any coffee .
I have a lot of friends in Boston .
I &apos;d rather be a bird than a fish .
We &apos;re here because of you .
I can &apos;t sleep with all this noise .
I don &apos;t know whether Tom is hungry or not .
Is that all you have ?
What does Tom think ?
She will be able to answer your question .
I would just like to thank all of you for your work .
Tom &apos;s French isn &apos;t very good .
Where did you buy flowers ?
Which goes faster , a ship or a train ?
Tom seemed angry .
It looks like Tom is lonely .
Tom didn &apos;t do that for us .
Yesterday , they went to the movies .
Tom promised to help .
Tom is younger than you think .
All I want to do is close my eyes and get some sleep .
I have some homework to finish .
Everyone is drunk .
I thought you &apos;d want to take a look .
Tom looks young , doesn &apos;t he ?
Why are you still up ? You should get to bed .
Tom asked Mary how John was doing .
Did you talk to your wife ?
We still have an hour before we need to be there .
What does Tom see in Mary ?
Tom thinks what I did was wrong .
I think Tom needs your help .
I don &apos;t have a whole lot of time .
It now looks as good as new .
She left her son alone in the car .
I was there last night .
This dictionary is mine .
Let &apos;s go into the other room .
Tom was guilty .
I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time .
I have visited the place time after time .
I went by bus as far as London .
Do you have a friend named Tom ?
Can I sit with you ?
Why is it so hot ?
It is impossible to know what will happen in the future .
I didn &apos;t actually do that myself .
They can &apos;t get in .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a bad idea .
I can &apos;t hear a word Tom is saying .
I &apos;m well .
You made the right call .
I &apos;m not a teacher .
I want to see you in my office this afternoon .
Tom has three older brothers .
I &apos;m here to help .
I want Tom .
I loved the play .
It really works .
You &apos;ll see it .
If I knew that , I &apos;d tell you .
Tom didn &apos;t study at all .
It was hot yesterday .
Why do you like it ?
I can &apos;t play the piano , but she can .
What did he do to you ?
Do you think Tom will like it ?
Tom has already done that three times this week .
Are you sure that you want to go there ?
I am right .
I &apos;ll do the shopping for you .
They know who I am .
I wouldn &apos;t have made it without you .
There will be no school a week from today .
He runs as fast as you .
I thought I was too old .
He &apos;s right behind you .
I still don &apos;t know how to do this .
Let &apos;s try to understand one another .
Tom can &apos;t do everything himself .
Tom is tall .
Tom made some coffee .
It &apos;s not for me to say .
Tom isn &apos;t going .
I &apos;m afraid of Tom .
Tom can trust Mary .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
Tom is studying French .
I can &apos;t watch this anymore .
I knew something like this was going to happen .
How big you are !
It being Sunday today , we have no school .
Tom knows that he can trust Mary .
He is rich and I am poor .
Do you have anything on for this weekend ?
Tom always does that by himself .
This is how I made it .
Tom wants Mary to want him .
Why don &apos;t you come ?
Tom kept me waiting for more than three hours .
Nothing &apos;s working .
He &apos;s as strong as a horse .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why Mary is scared of him .
Tom put the box on the table .
Did you have a good sleep ?
Tom has been living here alone for the past six months .
I &apos;m not that crazy .
We &apos;re going out .
Tom and I see each other every day .
There is one problem .
He must have missed the train .
Tom also has a daughter .
A student wants to see you .
Tom was in jail at the time .
That university was my first choice .
Who ran ?
Tom shouldn &apos;t have even been there .
If I had had enough money , I would have bought the book .
You &apos;re the only one who knows how to do this .
Keep the change .
I &apos;ve already finished reading this book .
Tom asked me how often I went to Australia .
Tom and I &apos;ve known each other quite a few years .
My house is very cold .
Tom asked a question .
What is that over there ?
We should give Tom a chance .
Not everyone is honest .
Did you see Tom in the park ?
I &apos;ll call the police .
Do you know if Tom can speak French ?
Tom seemed nervous .
Look what Tom wrote on the wall .
I didn &apos;t want to spend any more time in bed .
We want to know why .
That man over there is Tom .
I know what &apos;s going on .
Tom says that he doesn &apos;t remember having made such a promise .
The future will come soon enough .
Tom didn &apos;t want to ask for help .
I read at least one book every month .
Have you ever met Tom &apos;s girlfriend ?
If I didn &apos;t have money I wouldn &apos;t have a house .
I wish I had enough money to buy a new bicycle .
Please tell the others everything you &apos;ve just told me .
Why did she ask for our help ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know what got into Mary .
He stopped smoking last year .
Thanks Tom , I appreciate it .
That &apos;s not a cat . It &apos;s a dog .
I made up my mind to be a doctor .
He stood behind me .
It &apos;s all in the report .
I don &apos;t know how long .
I don &apos;t know her real name .
We &apos;re happy to see you .
Tom said he saw Mary yesterday .
When will they give a concert ?
Tom is still a kid .
He will not stay for more than four days .
What are you doing in my office ?
We don &apos;t like the rain .
Mary was wearing the same dress as Alice .
She is mad at me .
Why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
That &apos;s the house I used to live in .
When Tom first told me that , I didn &apos;t believe him .
Tom convinced me to go .
I think we should go now .
He looked around the room .
Tom is a good guy .
I asked Tom to speak French .
What are you getting out of this ?
Don &apos;t put any sugar in my coffee .
Give it to anyone you like .
Make a list .
I want more of that .
When does the next train leave ?
I &apos;m from the future .
I know Tom and Mary broke up .
You &apos;re too big .
There was only one problem .
You &apos;re interesting .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s sister .
I &apos;m the only one who knows for sure .
Where are my things ?
I &apos;d like to be able to tell Tom that he has nothing to worry about .
Tom was home all night .
Do you want another one of these ?
I play the piano a little .
You should eat more fruit .
My telephone doesn &apos;t work .
