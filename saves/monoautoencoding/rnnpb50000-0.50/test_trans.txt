Be nice to her .
How come you so so ?
There &apos;s something I want to do with you .
I can &apos;t think of anything I don &apos;t want .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked all over for Tom , but I can &apos;t find him .
Is he going to make it ?
That . it &apos;s raining !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to everyone .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s how you like the rules .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary died on Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It &apos;s a <UNK> of here this summer .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call while I was out ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats in the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked me .
We &apos;d be happy if you can come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the guitar by myself .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom sat as far as the door from the door .
It suddenly started raining .
I know my brothers and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very proud of you .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman was beginning of the pictures .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s feed the book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows what we should do .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary , but she didn &apos;t remember him .
You said too much .
All of them ran across the movie .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem that you can see you .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat less than my boyfriend .
What are you going as ?
There &apos;s very little book left .
Are we going to eat out ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in here .
He was absent with us .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on ?
Tom likes himself better than coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the train ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played together all day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it still hot here ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help me .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog <UNK> me to my house .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work this weekend .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not be waiting at dark .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your car here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like .
Tom came to my office for my money .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a camera two days ago .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking beer and wine .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many people to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never be dead .
You were with Tom with me , Tom .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about this ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was completely at the library , but I couldn &apos;t find her house .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll show you around .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was wrong with it .
When should I feed the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also this train .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom man .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read well , can you ?
It looked like Tom wanted to say more , but he didn &apos;t .
I &apos;d say not go for it .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house to buy .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple enough .
You &apos;re really pretty , too .
Tom can &apos;t answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could travel every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that can &apos;t make French at French ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How has your weekend been so hot ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine day , we can &apos;t take it .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it .
There is a big park near my school .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been your problem from the law .
I think I enjoyed .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very sad when he was ill .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put these in a box ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , don &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say is not true ?
I &apos;m not sure if I am this one .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that girl .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary both cut together together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known , you would be here , are you ?
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is out .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love cooking .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
Try not lives .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who wants to meet you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t want to go there .
He called her every day every day .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t talk them .
You were worried , Tom .
How old is Tom ?
Give us three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The play is filled with children .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom &apos;s best .
Tom has been waiting for three books .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is eight minutes after ten .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need it anymore .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m Japanese , but you can speak French very well .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really worried about my sisters .
Do you want to know more ?
We have two older than John .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can &apos;t speak French by that .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything like you .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have anything to do ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what happened Mary ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive until it was too late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This tree has been killed in a month .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really as good as we used on .
He <UNK> back something she had heard about her .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the old man every day .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s all the things to you , I &apos;ll do it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like Mary .
I need something to drink with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he had to get some time .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys trying to do it ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way to sing .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who know him him .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no wind in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take an weeks .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents have to work ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary at John .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat , Tom or children ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that wearing your ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your afternoon ?
I &apos;m about Tom as soon as he used to be .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the knife ?
You aren &apos;t like the other boys .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I do it when I see it .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m just not my mom with me .
They look one of his car .
The baby was fast enough .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two even really good .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should answer his letter .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could speak French .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you both crazy ?
Tom asked Mary if she was happy with her new job .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are friends to be around .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived as usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you all OK ?
Tom knows that Mary knows .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we talk and talk about it ?
Tom hasn &apos;t returned yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me isn &apos;t important .
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with this ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s arm .
What do I do ?
Tom isn &apos;t as smart as Mary think he is .
If you &apos;d ask me to you , I &apos;ll find it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it would rain .
We &apos;ve been on to do this .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only person I &apos;ve ever seen .
How did you come up with such a good idea ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do with that .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t know anything we can do .
The little girl did nothing but simple .
You gave Tom the money , did you ?
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true from everybody .
Tom closed his eyes and walked .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for something ?
They all look the best .
She did come , but he didn &apos;t care .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this age tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand you to eat that .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll be there again .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This can do we can .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand .
I found this book very interesting .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m kind of Tom .
I just wanted to say thank you .
We have a big dog .
How was today today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon be a father .
Tom showed Mary around the library .
This is a very tall tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all dancing together .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret sooner or later .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good plan to study English .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is easy , Tom .
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a swim .
What a nice idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that word with me .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in that situation .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you do , you will do with you .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He knows my address .
You weren &apos;t supposed , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here very long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to call this question .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to understand you . I want to help you .
I am ready .
I have three books I need .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like three books .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom first , Mary ?
I &apos;m told that Tom takes to work on work .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children look healthy .
Tom is under a tree , isn &apos;t it ?
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom .
Can anybody anything be done ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always not .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many people has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the garden .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that shirt ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sat on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many apples did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get the job , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the table .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Turn out that fire .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always warm .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , but he used to .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t see you again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to movies .
They were afraid .
She needs some money to buy something .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the radio .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What &apos;re you so sure Tom was the one who stole the umbrella ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi at once .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as he comes , let me know .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about the world .
Tom seems like this kind of tea .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to get home .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he heard the picture , he said that the window .
I think what you need something to eat .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both tall .
What is the difference between this and learn ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Both people and he won &apos;t come well .
He did what I wanted wrong .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually buy for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my pen ?
I came here for a while .
That woman was in my garden .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t coming today .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not to do anything for six days .
It &apos;s definitely Tom &apos;s business .
Tom and Mary decided John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked for .
It looks great .
When I came home , my sister was the one .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that bottle ?
There isn &apos;t much difference between the two .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That house is very near the lake .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he had to study French in Boston .
The book has bought this book was very bad .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary have both very friends .
Your French is too good .
It isn &apos;t as if we were rich .
Take the dog for a walk .
I &apos;ve got this job .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I am calling with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much work to do at the moment .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family need to school ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was been raining for that day .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book seemed interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to finish this .
I know why you are here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just been very busy .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So where were you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t understand what will make of me .
It looks as well as it is .
This is just the type of work .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I like the way you walk .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
&quot; Not snow , she will fall in love .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all !
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like telling him what I think of him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s even raining .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here somewhere .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you play tennis or golf ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Go , please .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot go to work at once .
I love cake .
Tom and I were up all night before .
How many people do you know when you &apos;re here ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your guitar ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was very popular ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason for Tom .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to the hospital .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that this morning .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people were killed in the war .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very hungry all the time .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The cat &apos;s house is so expensive .
I read several books last week .
I have a little cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom why Mary and John were married .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the enemy with this .
One light we will be on time .
They look angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is for you to be happy .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really not understand it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that happening .
Are you still mad ?
In the years in beautiful eyes .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t completely alone .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very close friend , but he &apos;s not coming .
My mother and I parents got together on time .
Tom wears on making mistakes .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom opened .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How jokes are healthy ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that far from here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t arrive until it was very late .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but she didn &apos;t .
She was the first girl I &apos;d ever seen .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I go to learn with this ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told you something that way to visit .
Both his parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always sitting .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re doing ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How don &apos;t I just give you for ?
Tom can hardly see without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing together .
I can &apos;t remember what I asked him .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should helped Mary with her homework .
Can you show me where you live on this map ?
I have not had a chance to see that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something of you .
How come he didn &apos;t come at ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat ran away and never came back .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have the key to tell Mary his car .
He stood up for what was right .
The dog sitting on that bench is Tom .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me under the table .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
All of going to go to the movies , but you can &apos;t help it .
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary did they do what she asked him to do .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just fire Tom .
He &apos;s wearing out nervous .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my little sister &apos;s seat .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you want to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary and Alice .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me everything .
I love you people .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , but they aren &apos;t anymore .
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t have you here for us .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new around here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so so .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve studied French very well .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything .
Tom seems angry .
It is their names .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary and John went along together last weekend .
Who spoke you ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the best man to live .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom is always here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this summer ?
Tom told me that he thought he might be interested in doing that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was alive .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I saw you last week .
He knows the city well .
Tom was just in Mary &apos;s girlfriend .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is worth reading again .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m swimming .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have bad news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the shirt and it was too small .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told you that he loved Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much at speaking .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it says ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off .
Tom said you &apos;re able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How long is it no ?
Thanks for both of you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom for it .
I never meant to see you in any problems .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to have anything to do with me .
Tom said he decided it was too late to do .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I think I want to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom sleeping ?
Whose name is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell him that I am .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you have just two cars ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were a bit more .
I found the problem that Tom had lost .
Tom is almost six feet .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They will be a good cook when you came with being here .
We are calling the police .
Tom is used to here on this medicine .
How much is this worth ?
Tom visited us this morning .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the book you were born very well .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his car .
That must never happen .
Her son will succeed for sure .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary seen that ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother thinks she &apos;s going to visit me soon .
I just wanted to say thank you for here .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you can &apos;t tell you that .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several good friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to do that .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all started in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What type is Boston in Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost three times as big as we are .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t know me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need someone to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that building at the bus ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d kept up my mind .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone else .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it once .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The night is still young .
I do not understand what you did .
Did you use my heart ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father became old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these letters ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars and then why John wasn &apos;t .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would likely be serious .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never be late .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as I love Tom .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the house where we stayed last year .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please be ready to see everything in the snow .
It can be very thinking .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before .
I guess you won &apos;t be eating with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom , where are we ?
She advised him where he should stay .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you &apos;re here now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more like you .
It is difficult to learn French .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have something to do .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take five o &apos;clock .
Tom can &apos;t handle this job on his own .
Tom had a chance to travel to Boston .
We just want to know who is mine .
We &apos;ll find a solution , but I &apos;m not sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in bed .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be anything else for anyone .
Come back in .
This table is the same as that one .
&quot; Whose umbrella is this ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Tom &apos;s . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now or impossible .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the feeling of what you had said .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask your wife .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to my office , please ?
Tom , Mary aren &apos;t always funny anymore .
Tom hardly ever makes us any days .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in French and then left the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me today &apos;s paper , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been anything like that .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home .
Tom said he thought Mary might need that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their daughter .
I wonder if he &apos;s mad .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read such a book ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to do that .
I want to speak French .
Do I get to the window ?
He said , but it &apos;s ten o &apos;clock .
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There doesn &apos;t speak there who a story .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle .
I can &apos;t see you with your mother .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This dress is much too much for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to let him go for his birthday .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your work .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well and night all well .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s nice to be here and talk with you .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to make in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a picture for kids .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
I &apos;m very big .
My father drinks a cup of coffee every morning .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a cake for Tom ?
Tom only has one under its arm .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really worried about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the phone and call him .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom gave everything what most people were in the class .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , we are in Australia , please .
Tom is trying too much for himself .
I brought something to you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put Tom up to it ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The wine is still warm .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept hours hours .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , please , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the place .
Tom hasn &apos;t been totally honest with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that there all well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the whole popular near here .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I took you .
I found the building .
He did nothing but watch TV all day .
Do you know what Tom ate for lunch ?
Do you want me to enjoy Tom ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is so hot I can &apos;t drink it .
The boy man doesn &apos;t love me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you ever wondered why Tom might eat ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me if I had finished well .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , and do about .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he &apos;s strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar is my younger brother .
Tom needs help now .
How long do you think Tom is ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had called here .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak ill of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in class .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t seem to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your Tom will make them .
I think I should &apos;ve stayed .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me anywhere .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I make from the truth .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like summer the best .
When I came to see , he was watching TV .
The sky has become innocent .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That job hard hard .
I found this restaurant by myself .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you , of that song .
My mother could speak five languages .
Tom has to go to bed early .
Tom went into Boston .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says things doesn &apos;t really believe .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I never knew that this will come .
It will not happen more than three minutes .
What color did you buy ?
It was a different time .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like a pizza .
Here &apos;s a book for your mother .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked .
You were busy .
I like both cats and meat .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe me ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in there .
I &apos;m only going to tell you one more time .
I &apos;m a little sugar .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our own work .
I &apos;ve come to Boston quite often .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how expensive it is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother from the office .
How pretty flowers !
I &apos;m mad at both .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking French in Australia .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather will rain tomorrow .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , what &apos;ll you understand ?
What part is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I think .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the rules ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone for a second ?
Is this yours ?
That doesn &apos;t really do it , does it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s your favorite room ?
I saw my grandmother a week .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary , too .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you are hungry , you &apos;ll eat vegetables .
There is a cat on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you just go .
Tom would like to know what Mary asked .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had got another morning .
These are older , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of reading do you like to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get there .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s this morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly get time to do that anymore .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all we doing here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as cold as this morning .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best we could .
Tom , Mary , John and John came here together .
We &apos;ll be friends tonight .
I do look pretty good .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car would him .
He wrote no to my advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom could do .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your computer ?
Your idea sounds a good one .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This would do what my mother hadn &apos;t seen me .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time , we met each other ?
I knew that he was born .
Tom is very open .
You do that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something you want to say to you ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that can run .
His did not want in Japan .
My cat loves something .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every sentence in that book is important .
How come you just seen Tom here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my first class .
I &apos;d have let you know if I wouldn &apos;t have known .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the book happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the key I want to marry Tom .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
You &apos;re the first age I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more coffee than drinking .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had just been married .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It seemed like a new job .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s just going to be hungry .
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I stole the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; Have you seen Tom ? &quot; &quot; In Australia . &quot;
How long were you driving ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk a little younger on time .
This man is very , very hot .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that I had kissed him .
He knew it all along .
The tall man went out of the house .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a tie to take this suit .
This book is easy enough for children to read .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This letter was for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind of young . He wants to go home .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and put them on his desk .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried again and immediately that he wasn &apos;t crazy .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know your people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you &apos;re here to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know where it means all the time .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John in Australia .
I told you Tom would help us out .
You &apos;re having dinner at the office .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom might barely pass out this work .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been born .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If you can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get so angry .
I don &apos;t have an old friend in this area .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How rich are they ?
I &apos;d like to go for you .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her eyes .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t stand a chance .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home just before .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the test .
Tom is a friend of my dad &apos;s name .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to play tennis with Tom .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how you &apos;ve been .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I did without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The old is very long .
My list is quite long .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said that was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired again .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What and then were all talking about ?
It would take a little five hours after I do that .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really wanted to say what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Our team lost the first game .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her sister .
I think it &apos;s time for me to call it .
I &apos;d like to have a little friends .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my family so much .
