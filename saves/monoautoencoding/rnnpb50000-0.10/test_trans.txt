Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that you want to do .
I can &apos;t think of what I want .
I think it &apos;s not good not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve got a friend for Tom .
Is he going to make it ?
That &apos;s !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so angry when they go there .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Tom was dead .
They are proud of his daughter .
It looks like you like to cook about this .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks forward to my help .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom break in my eye ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are a run desk there .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why Mary was .
We &apos;d better be late by 2 : 30 .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to call this movie .
You &apos;ve got the right .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house all to myself .
Tom would &apos;ve been involved of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see anything to tell you that .
Tom sat in about Japan .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my brothers .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be !
I see your house in the house .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman sat on the desk .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused to work .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to succeed .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows that that .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her room .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary , but he doesn &apos;t .
You read too much .
All of them words very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem that you &apos;re here .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat studying French .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very hot box .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill , so he is kids .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea coffee every time .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your address .
Tom and Mary played together after six months .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it true like this ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help you .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog will be my friend .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us to work this time .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest .
He could not stand being kept them .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the address .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your room .
Tom looked like he was dead .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my room to me .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a new car .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like coffee wine .
He is brought by everybody .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s lawyer .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this is .
Tell Tom he has been there .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never have .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was able to find the house , but I couldn &apos;t find her house .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll go to the office .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was far from the beach .
When should I feed the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also going to help you this .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will come .
We almost had everything .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looked like Tom to say anything or not .
I &apos;d not go out for it .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems means enough .
You &apos;re really good .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want me ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom really did that ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How has your hair ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the hand ?
It was a good restaurant , so we stayed here .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big country .
I promised Tom I wouldn &apos;t say you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been here for me .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very nervous so late .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put these in a box ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What do you look and believe ?
I &apos;m not young if I like this .
My father had me do that .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed with that .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was almost killed .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary won &apos;t together together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had had a girlfriend , I would do that .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s OK .
That was really fun .
A car is stolen a lot .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat must be after his go .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody else to want you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called him the best way .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom explain with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they live .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How well is Tom ?
Give us three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The light is filled with children .
Why didn &apos;t anybody tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very young of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a camera all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you everything is my father .
The next time has missed one before .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by hope .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m so happy that I &apos;m not interested in my parents .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter who lives in a town .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this Tom &apos;s car ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t want to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak only to sing .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is here .
You can ask me anything .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name like that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be there .
You can make your own .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive near it .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This bed is broken .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not going out here , are you ?
He took her choice .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the door across .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s for the , I &apos;ll be there .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new car .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he couldn &apos;t get to sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who you is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those sure you know him well .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no room in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take now .
Maybe we should be careful .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do .
How was today &apos;s &apos;clock ?
Tom smiled at his desk .
Please let me go .
What &apos;s that your mother ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your room ?
I &apos;d like to marry Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you open the room ?
You aren &apos;t like the other children .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave as soon as usual .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry too small .
They enjoy married .
The baby seemed to be fast asleep .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two are to blame .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I &apos;m going .
We can &apos;t be able to do that .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got a lot .
I can &apos;t get the train .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you my lawyer ?
Tom asked Mary not not do it with her new car .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are looking to me .
I know it &apos;s funny .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two brothers ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we sit down and that ?
Tom hasn &apos;t sent Mary .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me ?
Tom is good at sure .
Let me carry you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I can do .
What does this have to do this ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to kill him .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as most people think he is .
If you &apos;d ask me for it , I would never kiss you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been asked to do that now .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in Boston now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do that .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in a York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
How did you come up with the plan ?
Where do I ask you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do that .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my bicycle ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing we can do .
The little movie did nothing but fruit .
You gave Tom the money , would you ?
Don &apos;t let me know .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His speech came .
Tom closed his eyes and got out .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for something ?
They all look the same .
She did him , wait .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s mine .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this evening ?
We were studying French .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about that .
I can understand why you did that .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This we can do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand .
I found this very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not impressed . I &apos;m not worried about Tom .
I just wanted to say them .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon be a father .
Tom showed Mary around the party .
This is a very tall .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw you , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , isn &apos;t that ?
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the police sooner .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good teacher to school .
Where did you leave your house ?
It is likely to believe that , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a long time .
What a nice idea ?
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do want Tom .
Let &apos;s stop my face .
Don &apos;t say that name again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what Tom promised about that .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
I thought you wanted this .
No matter what you do , you have to do this .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away yesterday .
He raised my eye .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from experience .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to remember this moment .
I &apos;d like to sing .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I am ready .
I have questions to read .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m full of reading this book .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see your secret .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been here ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom all name ?
I &apos;m surprised to do that now .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children are healthy .
Tom sat under a tree yesterday .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three days .
Can &apos;t actually make a mistake ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s no idea .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that dress ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I &apos;ve get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could change .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;ll be back .
How many flowers are stolen ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go the time , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to school .
Put out that .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you tell me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a way of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to wear his glasses .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive either .
I always go to school to school .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t ever see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to be .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy something .
How do you think I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia yesterday ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What don &apos;t you like me to answer the letter ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as he knows me , let me know .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems very happy .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel lonely .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he heard his son , he went to his house .
I think this is what you want to eat more .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little nervous .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even his name , he is .
He did what I wanted right away .
You have to get as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he likes .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new car ?
I came here for a vacation .
That woman where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We were up here today .
Leave them alone .
Is there anything in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have hardly have anything to eat before this morning .
It &apos;s lucky Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked for .
It looks great .
When I came to see my girlfriend .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t much difference between the two .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That hotel is very large .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book I saw was very interesting .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have very few minutes .
Your French is really good .
It isn &apos;t as expensive as we live .
Take the dog a drink .
I &apos;ve got this problem .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with his son .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much time to do all .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not that heavy that I ran away .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book is interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for us .
I know why you &apos;re going here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just found Tom to say .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a boy .
I do not like this song .
Is there where you were ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what will happen .
It looks like it .
This is just very happy .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to do it for once .
I like the way of work .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
Keep the window .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all do that .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel telling him what I do without him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a new car .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s just how .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s OK here .
You have to study history .
We have things to do .
Would you rather famous or not ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to me .
He is able to find a new computer .
Tom looked happy .
Most boys love .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were talking all night waiting .
How many times do you speak French ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my father .
Which is your sentence ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was in his room ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason to Tom .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report by tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people are told .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very hungry for the meeting .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant that we went to be so expensive .
I read several books last week .
I have a very cold heart .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom why he didn &apos;t seem to know .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no choice .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
&quot; Tom should be in time today .
They grew angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be happy .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that .
Are you still mad ?
In October , there was an apple .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t always killed .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a father , but he &apos;s not sure .
My mother is busy now .
Tom keeps on making the same mistake .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom said it would be .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .

Do you feel sorry ?
Maybe Tom kissed her .

I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but Mary held .
She was the first girl I told you .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?

Both my parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the team .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer the questions .
You said so stupid .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many people have to do that ?
Tom can hardly see anything .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in another nothing .
I can &apos;t remember what question .
The door wasn &apos;t open .
No one wants that .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Can you show me where you live on ?
I have not go to the movies until class .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How did you tell us to he ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than me .
Who told you about your advice ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat ran away and left .
They were lucky .

My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have the way to show me the way .
He stood up for me .
The man sitting on it is Tom .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry the piano .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Do you want to go with me ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom told us he wanted to do .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just help Tom .
He &apos;s getting drunk out .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my book .

What kind of books do you like to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary and he was married .
Tom lived in Australia about three years .
I &apos;m not leaving as well as you tell me .
I love you people .

I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t have you bought your new shoes .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this book very much .
That wasn &apos;t my decision .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to hurt .
Tom seems angry .
It is out .
Tom did it just for us .
Tom died for his glasses .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .

We might learn it for a few days .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has his brother .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to use this on foot ?

I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was glad to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was asked by Mary to go there .
You &apos;d better start today .

My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , but he doesn &apos;t .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m with Boston .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have to stop you .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the shirt to the park .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom told Mary how ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it &apos;ll win ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off next week .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .

I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .

Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .

Tom has been sick in bed all for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .

That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your money ?
I know you know when you are angry .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son will be free for help .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have you known Tom ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother always loves me a new car .
I just wanted to say things for you .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
I &apos;m dying to be a policeman .
Let me all !
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom and Mary .
Let &apos;s forget hope .
I have no friends to go .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wants to go to Boston with .
I &apos;ve got a secret .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all started in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is Boston in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost as fast as we can .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you made your umbrella ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who needs .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to study .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s already lost what to say .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift .
What &apos;s that look at that house ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d gotten hurt you .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone help me .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a song for everyone .
I spoke to him about it .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The boy is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you say you ?
I looked at Tom &apos;s jokes .

She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the last bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as Tom kissed I .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the church where we took home .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little taller than me .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come and see me here .
It can be used in a way .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before before he left .
I guess you won &apos;t be angry with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got a girlfriend .
Tom , where are we ?
She advised him advice .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more than you like .
It is difficult to understand this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .

Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never had anything else to say something but not .
Come back in .
This table is the same list .
&quot; Whose is your name ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Tom &apos;s . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now still .
What were you doing there ?
I have the same fun as you have .
Thanks for having me .
I need to ask you for a few questions .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the office tomorrow ?
Tom &apos;s jokes aren &apos;t as funny as Mary .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a lot of me .
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would happen ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said that wasn &apos;t left .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me today &apos;s hand , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been anything but to show you .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home with us .
Tom said he &apos;d &apos;ve asked Mary to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said !
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you have to do that ?
There seems something in the future .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that word .
Please do something is there .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me with this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?

Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle .

What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s nice to use this shoes .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary did that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to use this .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a place for children .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father bought a cup of coffee every morning .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more to your life with you .

You have to find the cat on the road .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he does .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what most people should &apos;ve told .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , we can do it as well as you can .
Tom is trying to do so .
I brought something that I want to give you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put Tom trying to give it ?
Tom told me that he was beautiful .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The plane is still laughing .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept eight hours .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is here .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .

They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .

It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the building .
He did nothing to live all day .
Do you know what Tom learned for us lunch ?
Do you want to play playing Tom ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is very small .
The boy doesn &apos;t like me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my opinion .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have any of you already married ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that for your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at six .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d already leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me whether I had go home last night .

Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had called the book .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak out of the future .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been played before .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope Tom will be your father .
I think I should go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t know when he &apos;s right .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .

Tom made that himself .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t make all mistake .
My mother could speak French .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes doesn &apos;t work .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my fault .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always liked this choice .
It will rather rain last year .
What color do you buy ?
It was a different question .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for your mother .
Tom lost his camera .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked for me .
You were busy .
I like cats very cats .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she didn &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in time .
I &apos;m only going to say it time .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We need to do it .
I &apos;ve been to Boston soon .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how difficult it is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s .
I called my uncle up from the station .
What color is you !
I &apos;m being friends of all .
This is quite quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for the money .
Why can &apos;t we leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking French next year .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather will be .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , I &apos;m pretty sure .
What month is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I am right .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to pick me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of anything .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the purpose ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you for a second ?
Is this telling you ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us , is it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her five years ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this door .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you fall to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for John and Alice .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you are hungry , I &apos;ll eat the apple .
There is a cat on the wall .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom would like to know something about everything .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had better hurry .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of music do you do to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to be mad .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a date ?
How much do you like ?
We didn &apos;t get that interesting .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s time .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly afford to do that anymore .
Tom left the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all these stuff here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up all night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as cold today as it was yesterday .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice were here .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do good pretty .
Tom asked Mary what she wanted to go .
He paid me for my advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom should do .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary what she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea how to speak French .
I &apos;ve been told that I needed that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what my mother caught me .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first train ?
I knew he was .
Tom is very open .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say that ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that car .
Mary did they want to do that alone .
My cat loves milk .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every book from it is from .
How long did you stop you here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my birthday .
I &apos;d have you told you the truth .
I can &apos;t walk with this now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the woman I saw .
Tom and Mary often swim well .
You &apos;re the first person I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s up yesterday .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more coffee than another beer .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had gotten killed .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t walk every year .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It &apos;s a bad reason .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not even , isn &apos;t it ?
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I use the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; I should wait .
How fast were you driving ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is going to drive to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to thank Tom and Mary a sister .
This window is just and Tom .
That girl &apos;s not a doctor .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s boyfriend .
Look at Tom &apos;s .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the church ?
We didn &apos;t hear a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that she was hungry .
He knew it all along .
The tall man came on the fire .
I know what Tom is doing .
I want to go to Boston with a car .
This book is easy enough to read .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question .
This letter &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better take a work at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind of seeing Mary .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m just surprised .
I think Tom looks like .
What are you here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , doesn &apos;t he ?
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and put them on his desk .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried by wine and again .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel beautiful for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some books to say .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has written .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for you .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s paid all the time .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John so .
I told you Tom would help us .
You &apos;re having lunch at the office .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s <UNK> lunch together .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d be born Canadian .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If anybody can help us , Tom can .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll take it .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have something who lives in Germany .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How bed are they ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her family was beautiful .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on his clothes .
You don &apos;t remember a single deal .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home tonight .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to die there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the test .
Tom is a friend of my family .
Tom spoke almost French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to get of one of us .
Tom bought a new guitar .
I know how busy you &apos;ve called .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do to do that .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The baby is very looking for me .
I don &apos;t want to be tired .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid these money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything would said I was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something with you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way as if you were .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been busy three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What time is Tom ?
It would take away for three days .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for this once .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Our team lost the first love .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher is a young woman .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go home .
I &apos;d like to have a little more sugar .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my room .
