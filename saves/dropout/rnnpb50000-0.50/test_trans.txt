It doesn &apos;t look like that .
I &apos;ll do what I need to Tom .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not thinking .

Have you ever seen a cup of beer ?
How much do you want ?

Do you say what you have ?
I want to talk about him .
That &apos;s not how of my future .

Don &apos;t forget that it is mine .
Can you like your mother yet ?
I knew why he was .
Tom has changed .
You know where you &apos;re right .
Do you want to talk to Tom ?
No one is correct .
I &apos;m not going to seeing Tom again .
Is it there ?
It &apos;s a cold .
I have no idea who can speak French .
Will you really want to go swimming ?
Have you eaten yet ?
Is there anything we can help ?
I know what I do that .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
Don &apos;t you go there ?
