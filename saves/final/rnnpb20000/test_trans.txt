Tom told me he hasn &apos;t done that yet .
I want to see Tom again .
He was very busy all day .
We were able to swim .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
Her dinner is long .
Tom and Mary were alone .
How long do I have to stay ?
You want me to have , not we do it .
It can &apos;t be that bad .
Can Tom come tomorrow ?
I have children .
I want to live like that .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Australia .
Tom and Mary are happy .
Give me your watch .
Tom left a few minutes early .
I &apos;d like something to eat .
What am I going to do now ?
We &apos;ve come home .
I know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom is still very young .
They &apos;re waiting for us .
I &apos;ll be home late today .
I need you to come with me .
He speaks English and French .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in three years .
Tom isn &apos;t going to like it .
What did Tom want ?
I don &apos;t know how I did it .
They say that he is very rich .
I will do it right now .
I am here .
Is that your car ?
I need to go back to Boston .
They &apos;re not talking .
I don &apos;t like to be alone .
It would be better if it &apos;s time .
What is it that Tom want ?
Who &apos;s that girl ?
Tom &apos;s not home now .
I don &apos;t know that .
I &apos;m not sure if Tom will do that .
Do you know what Tom said ?
I won &apos;t buy that .
You should go .
Tom loves Australia .
What do you want to do with us ?
He came here ten years ago .
Tom seemed ready .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about it .
That &apos;s how it was .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be seen about it .
I wonder why Tom said that .
You can tell Tom yourself .
I &apos;ll do it , too .
Where &apos;s my money ?
I closed tennis .
I see Tom and Mary .
You can say that again .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as Tom .
I don &apos;t want to sleep .
That &apos;s a plan .
I cannot get the street on the street .
Why don &apos;t you think about it ?
Did Tom find you ?
You can have it .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to go home .
I want to read a book .
Do we have enough time to finish this before Tom ?
He wrote a letter yesterday .
Tom is coming , too .
You are big .
I had never done anything like that before .
Did you enjoy the movie ?
Where are my books ?
I want to talk to him .
What are you looking at ?
Tom will know .
This is nothing .
What was he here ?
Tom died .
Tom likes it here .
Tom kept me waiting for more .
Tom didn &apos;t know what he was doing .
I tried to do that .
His story can &apos;t be true .
Tom &apos;s doing OK .
Tom will do that again today .
He &apos;s not in .
I don &apos;t have so much money .
What &apos;s with Tom ?
I am able to swim .
I just don &apos;t believe it .
You can &apos;t see me , can you ?
Are you my doctor ?
Tom is angry with you .
They plan to get married tomorrow .
I &apos;m pretty sure that Tom can do that .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s friends .
Tom is eating .
Can you swim ?
Tom asked me to ask you something .
I know you &apos;re Tom .
That would like it .
Tom isn &apos;t young .
The door is open .
I &apos;ve been to my way already .
Did you really help you ?
I think that &apos;s wrong .
I &apos;ll go to Tom .
You must come with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to come .
What are you things ?
I love you more than anyone .
I think we should do it .
Why is it that you &apos;re doing ?
Tom knew what to do .
Don &apos;t you have any money ?
I tried it before .
It looks very good .
I don &apos;t think I want to know .
Tom was born in Australia .
I &apos;m coming .
I &apos;d like to have a cat .
She is his friend .
Mary and I have to study work .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know my name .
They &apos;re still young .
What else do you want to do ?
Tom and Mary both don &apos;t understand each other .
Tom &apos;s not &apos;s name .
How often do I have to tell Tom ?
I asked Tom why he did it .
You should eat more .
No one knows what has become of him .
You &apos;d better go now .
Can we leave now ?
Tom isn &apos;t very happy , is he ?
I don &apos;t see why Tom coming here .
We need to talk to you .
May I stay with you for a days ?
They &apos;re cold .
I do want to go with you .
We &apos;re pretty busy right now .
I want to speak with Tom .
I &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
Are you sure you really need ?
We became very good friends .
How was it ?
I know this is hard .
I &apos;d like to be your friend .
You might be right .
Tom doesn &apos;t want this .
You think you know why you can speak French very well .
I never think about it anymore .
Why don &apos;t we take it with us ?
I wanted to meet you .
Are you sure this is Tom &apos;s ?
Tom said you wouldn &apos;t go .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom said he &apos;d never come to Boston .
I have your dog with me .
Have you read this book ?
Would you like something to Boston ?
His family is very large .
I don &apos;t know why it happened .
No one had anything to me .
I wish you didn &apos;t do that .
I will speak with you tomorrow .
Tom told me that you &apos;d do that .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Tom is back in Australia .
I never wanted to do this .
I don &apos;t know what to do with it .
Do you want to be my girlfriend ?
I can &apos;t remember anymore .
How long were you there ?
What kind of books do you like ?
You can &apos;t do anything .
I can &apos;t work with Tom .
This makes me angry .
It was from Tom .
I love you for that .
Don &apos;t ask me to do that .
What is it you like about Tom ?
Why can &apos;t you go home ?
I don &apos;t think she is happy .
Tom isn &apos;t going to come home .
Tom did it for me .
Tom will be there soon .
You should do it here .
You can &apos;t go yet .
Do you want a car ?
Tom is really busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ll work alone .
I think it &apos;s for to go to school .
I wish she could come .
I &apos;ve said what I had to say .
Tom came to my office this morning .
I &apos;ve seen things .
Where &apos;s your brother ?
It &apos;s early .
Tom had no idea Mary was sick .
Have you heard why Tom had ?
It looks good on you .
Tom &apos;s left .
Where &apos;s your mother ?
I want to know who did that .
I have to get back to work .
Tom knew that what was wrong .
Tom told Mary that he had too good .
I &apos;ll get back to Boston anymore .
Is it big ?
When are you going out ?
I feel sorry for her .
We &apos;re not going to go to see Tom .
When was she coming ?
I didn &apos;t say it like that .
Where did he find the ?
That was never my problem .
You gave it to me .
Why are you looking at me ?
Tom was there with his girlfriend .
Tom knows we can &apos;t speak French very well .
Did Tom talk to you about us ?
Where did you buy that ?
We &apos;re going .
We want to have a family .
I don &apos;t want to live my house with me .
Why don &apos;t I go ?
I really don &apos;t want anything to eat .
Can you even speak French ?
Could you do that ?
Did you hear about Tom ?
Is you ready ?
He has not say anything , but he had no wife .
My mother was sick for two days .
You know what this is , don &apos;t you ?
Tom told me that he needed to worry .
Do you know when he will come ?
That was very good .
Do you know where they are ?
He is coming .
I don &apos;t feel finished all .
The bus will be here in a while .
I was not a good father .
He had nothing to do with it .
That &apos;s nothing wrong .
What &apos;ll Tom do with it ?
He cannot have done such a thing .
I think I &apos;m right .
We don &apos;t have the money .
Tom has told you do so long .
I don &apos;t like often .
My hair is too long .
French is difficult , isn &apos;t it ?
Tell Tom that when he &apos;ll come or not .
We don &apos;t have anything the time in the world .
This is difficult .
Tom is never late for school .
I thought Tom had something to tell you .
Do you have a brother ?
His mother is happy .
I just got the hair hair .
I go to school by school .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve kept you waiting .
I &apos;m still the boy I used to be .
Tom didn &apos;t see anything .
Tom is at home with Mary .
Tom knows about this already .
I don &apos;t think I understand you .
I want to do in French .
Tom lives alone in a house .
No one saw Tom do that .
There is more .
Have you seen you already ?
You &apos;re doing everything .
I must help him .
She &apos;ll be OK .
Tom told me not to drive this .
I don &apos;t know what to say about that .
I only have one question .
Tom read a lot .
Tom doesn &apos;t live with his parents .
This is the house where he lives .
Let Tom come .
How long will you have to wait ?
I don &apos;t know what to do with this .
Tom asked me to talk to Mary .
We came to Boston yesterday .
There was nothing for me to happen .
He &apos;ll be there in ten minutes .
I can &apos;t do any more .
This car is fast .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good .
I want you to come to Boston .
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
Tom was often late for school .
When did you get this ?
I &apos;d like Tom to be happy .
He said that he was happy .
Where did you see Tom ?
I don &apos;t often gave him out .
What do you think of Boston ?
I can &apos;t hear it .
Tom has just left .
You &apos;re going with me , don &apos;t you ?
There are a lot of life .
That was the plan .
He began to sing .
I didn &apos;t see her .
Please go .
I still need to talk to Tom .
Tom is looking good .
You shouldn &apos;t have come alone .
I &apos;d like you to go with me .
Tom really doesn &apos;t need the money .
Tom left .
What &apos;s Tom saying ?
You should do that right away .
I know how to do it .
I am going to write a letter .
Tom didn &apos;t think that what he said was true .
I &apos;m finished with you .
I love my father .
Tom didn &apos;t want the job .
If you don &apos;t know , you can go .
I need someone who I say .
I &apos;m glad to see you here .
This one &apos;s Tom &apos;s .
We &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
That is too difficult to help .
I &apos;ve got to Boston together .
Tom is in Boston now .
I don &apos;t think that Tom did it .
There was an accident .
If I were something , I can do it .
We didn &apos;t see Tom .
I can &apos;t show you .
She often comes late .
We &apos;re at home .
What is it ?
Tom has never asked him for money .
I shouldn &apos;t have told you this .
What did Tom do yesterday ?
Do you know what she said ?
You can stay as long as you like .
No one loves someone as much as I do .
It &apos;s not the first time .
I can &apos;t remember how to do it .
I can &apos;t tell Tom the truth .
I went to the hospital yesterday .
What else do I need to do ?
Tom doesn &apos;t get up early .
Is Tom at home now ?
Tom could see Mary .
I feel so cold .
You had better ask to go .
This is Tom &apos;s cat .
That &apos;ll be nice .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a bicycle .
I think that Tom should study .
Tom had nothing to drink .
This is his room , my life .
Don &apos;t you want to play with Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to understand .
I have to give it to Tom .
I think I have an idea .
Are you Tom &apos;s mother ?
He knows what &apos;s going on .
I should talk to Tom .
Is Tom afraid ?
Why didn &apos;t you come by bus ?
I think you can help us .
No one is home .
Tom knows no French .
Tom and Mary are happy at all .
I know that she doesn &apos;t know who I am .
I don &apos;t know where she lives .
English is hard , isn &apos;t it ?
It has to be done .
Are you able to swim ?
You can say what you like .
Do you want to go for a swim ?
I &apos;ll see you at the news .
I need some help with my work .
I knew who he was .
Tom likes you .
It was just a matter thing .
You &apos;re busy soon .
What &apos;s good ?
Tom has been here for long .
You &apos;re right , I think I think .
I &apos;ll go to the hospital .
Do you have a plan ?
How do you live like this ?
Tom came there soon .
Tom hasn &apos;t seen Mary picture .
I was talking about dinner last night .
Tom doesn &apos;t mind .
I want my shoes .
What &apos;s that got to do with Tom ?
Tom and I both want you to be happy .
How many do you need ?
I was just about to leave .
We haven &apos;t heard from Tom in a long time .
I &apos;d like you to do it , too .
He &apos;s getting old .
This is my book .
I &apos;ll see to it .
I want to learn French .
My parents live in the country .
I thought of that .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing all along .
You should leave at once .
No one says he can speak French well .
I have everything .
You &apos;re the woman I love .
I haven &apos;t seen in three minutes .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll come .
I shouldn &apos;t have done that .
Why aren &apos;t you in bed ?
I know exactly what I have to do .
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He seems to be sick .
Don &apos;t you want me here ?
What makes you happy , Tom ?
I bought her a watch .
I knew you would get it .
Why are we going to Australia ?
I don &apos;t believe it .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve already do that .
I have to be up at six .
Let Tom sleep .
Tom speaks French very well .
He has a lot of money to learn .
I can take the bus .
We won &apos;t be doing that .
I will learn .
Tom knows Boston .
Tom wanted his money back .
I want to see your mother .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
We didn &apos;t see anybody .
I have nothing to say to Tom .
I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
I don &apos;t drink to eat beer .
Tom has many friends to help him .
You do not look well .
I understand how good Tom is .
Tom knows what Mary wants .
Tom is all alone .
I met him three years ago .
Tom gave up too much .
I &apos;d like to hear anything .
I &apos;ve got to find Tom .
Tom has already seen it .
I like doing this .
Did you go to see Tom ?
You know that I &apos;m right .
Tom still doesn &apos;t need a dog .
I &apos;ve got some questions for you .
You &apos;d better go to bed at once .
Tom may be home .
That &apos;s for you to do .
I can &apos;t give these to Tom .
They say he &apos;s very rich .
I didn &apos;t read it all .
Where do you think it is ?
I see .
How many people do you have ?
What are you after ?
I &apos;m not not sure .
I &apos;ve lost it .
She was about to leave .
That would be difficult .
That &apos;s no problem .
We can &apos;t leave Tom alone .
We &apos;re not going to talk to Tom .
I could show you around the city .
That boy is Tom .
You don &apos;t know anything about me .
I &apos;m glad I was able to help you last week .
I have to do my homework .
I never heard him sing .
I think this is for you .
I think about them often .
What do you think of that ?
My friends are very important to say that .
Who wants to know ?
You shouldn &apos;t have told Tom that to help that .
I don &apos;t like Tom .
Why does it happen to me ?
I love my wife .
I can &apos;t let Tom go alone .
Tom shouldn &apos;t go there anymore .
Could you please help this ?
I &apos;ll tell you the truth now .
The bus hasn &apos;t come yet .
This is my room .
We want to talk with Tom .
Where is the station ?
Tom asked Mary to read it for him .
Where is the book ?
How would you say it ?
I love you more than I love her .
I know Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
I came back home .
You are to see it .
Tom isn &apos;t alone .
That &apos;s where I &apos;m going .
I should be done in an hour .
You said you &apos;d do it for me .
It &apos;s not so bad .
I was worried .
It &apos;s for Tom .
I &apos;ve got too busy to do .
I told Tom what you did .
That &apos;s his house .
Please wait for me at the station .
What do you think Tom is doing ?
We always take a bus .
I think Tom is going to like it here .
The story won &apos;t be bad .
It is nothing to me .
May I go to the hospital ?
They can &apos;t give me what I want .
Tom doesn &apos;t like to work by himself .
I &apos;ve met that movie before .
We don &apos;t know what &apos;s is going to say .
I &apos;ll help Tom .
Why do people say that ?
Don &apos;t you say a word .
What do we have ?
I need to learn French .
That &apos;s from Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
I know that Tom is tired .
What were you doing there ?
Tom lives all by himself .
The water is cold .
They will help .
We won &apos;t try it again .
I &apos;d like to ask you something .
It &apos;ll be fun to visit Boston .
Tom still loves Mary .
Where do they do it ?
It &apos;s not here .
Tom and Mary are doing that .
Tom may know where Mary is .
Tom says he &apos;s not done yet .
Tom still wants to come .
I know the of us .
I see why Tom doesn &apos;t like you .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t stay a lot .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
You &apos;re a good friend in a friend .
We have made a mistake together .
Is it too late ?
I hope you are well .
There is someone here .
I have no time to help you anymore .
I &apos;m about ready .
It &apos;ll be good .
Could you tell me how to get to the station ?
I thought Tom was here before .
I think Tom likes his job .
I &apos;d better go now .
We are about the park yesterday .
Tom had nothing to do yesterday .
Boston is my family now .
I have a problem .
I &apos;ll get one .
I think we &apos;re just done .
I &apos;d love to know everything about you .
There is a letter to talk to talk to you .
You &apos;re better than Tom .
I would like to know her name .
Are you saying you don &apos;t know ?
I got it to see .
How many of your students are here ?
I can stay .
I &apos;d like to play tennis with you .
Where did they learn this ?
I ate too much .
Tom saw him .
I think you &apos;ve done enough .
Tom would like to visit us tomorrow .
We plan to leave as soon as possible .
I &apos;d like to know what happened to Tom .
I want to stay here before .
I don &apos;t have time now .
I don &apos;t understand you at all .
Why are you doing it ?
I want to try this .
It &apos;s important that you &apos;re doing .
What do you do in Boston ?
I can &apos;t say exactly what &apos;s going on here .
I used to be pretty good at this .
I should &apos;ve a teacher .
I know that she isn &apos;t true .
I want more than that .
Why aren &apos;t you at Tom ?
Who did that do that ?
Tom tried to help .
Is there a problem I I know ?
The game is over .
We are glad to help you .
I did it for you .
Tom looks tired , isn &apos;t he ?
Tom and I each write that .
I &apos;ll do it .
I must learn French .
Do you have any idea who would do that ?
I &apos;m up .
I don &apos;t think Tom wants to go to Boston with me .
Tom couldn &apos;t walk .
We want to know .
I don &apos;t think I like it .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to go there .
They all have a party .
Tom and I are well .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
This was Tom &apos;s idea .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me you could speak French ?
How are you important ?
Is there anything else I can help you ?
I was born there .
Tom wanted to have it .
Tom is coming here .
Tom saw Mary waiting .
Tom has done it before .
I don &apos;t remember who gave this to me .
It seems that Tom has been here .
Tom isn &apos;t home yet .
Tom didn &apos;t want to wait .
I didn &apos;t know you had a sister .
I don &apos;t want to show you anything about that .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll do that .
I should &apos;ve stayed .
What do you want ?
My family is now .
Tom kept looking at Mary .
How &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
Tom knows the way .
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
How did you come by anything ?
Why didn &apos;t I think of that ?
Are you sick ?
The food was ready .
I have a question .
Why don &apos;t you come too busy for us today ?
I took off my shoes .
Is that what he wants ?
Tom loves music .
I don &apos;t know .
How beautiful is she ?
Tom didn &apos;t seem very busy .
Come home .
I don &apos;t think I know Tom .
Tom loves doing this .
We do what to do .
We have to tell them .
I told him to come .
It &apos;s not like I don &apos;t want to do it .
They aren &apos;t coming today .
I &apos;m at home .
What am I going to do ?
I don &apos;t want to read anything .
She &apos;s very beautiful .
I want you to be here .
Tom is quite happy .
Tom isn &apos;t going home .
What &apos;s Tom doing here ?
Come back in a day .
No one &apos;s going to see me .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
You should wait for Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t sure .
I don &apos;t know how I should do it .
I come from Boston .
Why won &apos;t Tom leave ?
There &apos;s no reason to be afraid .
I &apos;ll be be .
I go to bed at school almost every day .
Tom is her brother .
My whole world lives in Boston .
What can &apos;t do ?
He got into bed .
Do you have a girlfriend ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to go .
I thought I &apos;d go with you .
My parents don &apos;t know .
Tom said he &apos;s right .
Why do you want to know ?
Why doesn &apos;t Tom like Boston ?
He is soon to be a doctor .
Tom wanted this .
My daughter is your home .
I need water .
That &apos;s a picture of Tom .
I &apos;d ask Tom .
That &apos;s not what we want .
Tom likes tea better than money .
Tom shouldn &apos;t have let Mary drive .
Tom went there alone .
He lives there alone .
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
May I leave ?
I &apos;ve already tried .
Tom won &apos;t let you go .
Are you really that ?
What do you want to eat ?
Tom says he &apos;s going to study French .
This is the truth .
Tom does that .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Is that from Tom ?
How &apos;s it going with you here ?
There &apos;s still a lot .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m afraid of you in Boston .
You know why I &apos;m here .
Tom loves you .
This isn &apos;t exactly what I wanted .
He &apos;s doing it right .
Why didn &apos;t you tell the truth ?
I know Tom likes you .
&quot; What did she say ?
Where are they taking Tom ?
There are people happy .
Why are you going out ?
I was in the hospital for a few hours .
You look happy .
You &apos;re not thinking .
Are you tired ?
I &apos;d like to do that .
Many of my friends don &apos;t like children .
You didn &apos;t have to do that .
I love Tom .
I &apos;m not going to like the truth .
I won &apos;t talk to you .
Tom will go .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be at home .
Maybe Tom can help you .
I have been busy today .
That is a good idea .
Tom saw that Mary wasn &apos;t in his room .
I know what Tom had been things .
I &apos;ll let you do .
I wish you had more time for me .
Are Tom still in Boston ?
I need to know who you are .
I only have one &apos;s brother .
Tom isn &apos;t alone .
Tom has many friends .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me you were here .
I only told Tom what Tom said .
What &apos;s up with Tom ?
I think I don &apos;t understand you .
Tom says it &apos;s too good for us .
What &apos;s that boy &apos;s name ?
Tom likes them everything .
Tom is coming with me to Boston .
Tom and Mary are always able to tell me .
Did you do something you have ?
That &apos;s how that he &apos;s been .
May I visit you tomorrow ?
You &apos;re not going to believe it .
I said I wasn &apos;t believe .
He looked much much this morning .
I knew what Tom didn &apos;t know .
That &apos;s what I thought .
Could you make me waiting for me ?
How did you do it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I don &apos;t see Tom .
I forgot the book .
Nobody saw anything .
She knows what you did .
Tom asked a few good questions .
I didn &apos;t want to take Tom out .
Who are you ?
I could not understand what he said .
Tom didn &apos;t have anything to say .
I think it &apos;s having a lot of us .
How often do you come to Boston ?
Nobody had anything else to do .
Tom speaks French really well .
Tom says you need my help .
Where &apos;s my car ?
Tom and I want you to come with us .
My children are at school .
Tom asked Mary if she needed after me .
How is the weather outside ?
Tom knows what &apos;s really going to say .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s office ?
Mary is still at playing with Mary .
They &apos;re not good .
Let &apos;s try !
We &apos;ve got some questions for you .
I &apos;m through doing that .
I don &apos;t know how to say it .
Do what you want to do .
Tom asked me for help .
Tom wants Mary to know that Mary likes Mary .
Where is Boston ?
Tom is going to do fine .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d understand .
Is there anything else you want to know ?
Can you see Tom ?
It &apos;s difficult to find good .
I heard you talking to Tom .
I &apos;ll be right , Tom .
What &apos;s Tom done ?
I need coffee .
I still have them .
How often do Tom see Mary ?
Tom was surprised last night .
It was my idea .
She is always busy .
Tom says I look worried about you .
What are you doing here , Tom ?
We speak French .
Do you know what &apos;s wrong with Tom ?
Tom &apos;s not in .
Do you know how Tom does that ?
Tom has already gone to Mary .
I have to be in Australia next month .
Tom was thirty when he was thirty .
I never see you without my mother .
Tom speaks no French to his parents .
I know what it is .
Tom should never do that again .
How long will it stop ?
I &apos;ve tried already saying it .
I wish that was young .
I have what I want .
I can &apos;t believe that Tom is gone .
I no longer like you .
I was just trying to help .
Where do we go from here ?
Please don &apos;t look at me .
This was your idea .
Tom wasn &apos;t afraid .
There is no one here with that .
They made me wait for a long time .
It doesn &apos;t matter so much .
She must be very happy .
He wasn &apos;t there last week .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
I didn &apos;t know you had so happy .
Tom and Mary are friends together .
I would &apos;ve done anything .
How &apos;s the weather in Boston ?
It isn &apos;t good .
Tom has never been very busy .
Is that Tom &apos;s house ?
What did you just say ?
Tom gave us a lot of books .
She must have been rich .
No Tom really look like to do .
I will never forget this .
How do you do that ?
You know I love you !
Tom said he was asked to help .
Tom just left .
There &apos;s a cat in my house .
Let &apos;s study English .
We &apos;ve arrived .
I think they &apos;re happy .
That &apos;s what I thought , too .
Did you hear Tom and it ?
Tom doesn &apos;t look like his father .
Tom doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
What &apos;s your father &apos;s name ?
Tom has been in Boston since yesterday .
You want to go to Boston with Tom .
I came by car .
Where &apos;s Tom today ?
Tom &apos;s not in the hospital .
What do we want here ?
I know why Tom wants to do .
I thought you were right .
I know what I &apos;d do .
Where &apos;s the girl ?
Do you know where my watch is ?
We still have a lot of time .
I &apos;m not going to get it .
I &apos;ll try again .
Tom is very angry .
I know very little about him .
I don &apos;t understand that .
You &apos;re like Tom .
I didn &apos;t know you &apos;d been in Boston .
Tom is good at what he wants .
I &apos;m sorry , my father is it .
Did you hear what Tom said ?
Tom and Mary are getting married .
I have another idea .
What is good for you ?
Where is it ?
I think I found something .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
You have to do this now .
Why is that a problem ?
Tom went in Boston &apos;s house .
I &apos;ll stay a few more days .
We &apos;re not rich .
Tom is at school , isn &apos;t he ?
What are these ?
What happened here ?
You have to go to school .
We did that just for fun .
She is very angry with me .
This is your book .
I see Tom .
What time do you think that &apos;ll do that ?
Tom said he &apos;d do that for Mary .
Tom can &apos;t be over thirty .
I &apos;m no longer tired .
He has no cat on .
I &apos;ve always wanted to do this .
Who &apos;s that with Tom ?
You should know better .
Where is the girl ?
If anyone can do that , I &apos;ll do that .
What kind of person did you see ?
I don &apos;t know how you do it .
Tom likes to play tennis .
Tom is already there .
Tom took off his hat .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom works for Mary .
Tom has gone too far .
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat .
We want Tom .
I have many people to do .
I know Tom pretty well .
You can &apos;t leave me .
Is it sick ?
Tom saw you .
We had a plan .
You know who I love , don &apos;t you ?
I do not have a sister .
I just want to do my job .
Tom looks like he wants to say something .
What kind of dog is it ?
Tom and Mary look coming .
What do they know ?
This is for you .
Maybe I should study French .
Tom makes a lot of mistakes .
I know what I have to do .
If I were you , I wouldn &apos;t do such a thing .
Tom said that he was be right .
Tom doesn &apos;t know you have a car .
You don &apos;t use anything .
I didn &apos;t want that .
I know where you can &apos;t stop .
I know the house where he was born .
I think that Tom is sick .
What does this do for Tom ?
I was there .
He &apos;s late for work .
Where does Tom live ?
You can &apos;t let Tom go outside .
This boy is my sister .
Your shoes don &apos;t like me .
I asked Tom some questions .
Tom will never understand .
I don &apos;t understand you .
This is my cat .
I come from Japan .
Where is your house ?
I know about that .
Tom says he wants to do that .
It &apos;s already time to go to school .
Come on !
I &apos;ve often been there .
I never thought I &apos;d find Tom .
He knows how to drive a car .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
Tom has to stay in bed .
You don &apos;t have to come tomorrow .
How could ask me ?
What do you have here ?
Everyone knows I &apos;m not Tom .
He left ten minutes ago .
I haven &apos;t had dinner .
Tom asked Mary to come home .
No one &apos;s going to find Tom .
Tom and Mary are good friends .
He &apos;s old enough to be his father .
He doesn &apos;t know me .
Who told Tom about Mary ?
I have another job now .
You gave it to us .
Tom became very cold .
She has a lot of money .
Tom won &apos;t listen .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t finished eating yet .
I &apos;m ready when you are .
I bought the book .
I heard what you said to do with Tom .
We want to have a baby .
I &apos;ll ask Tom .
How is your brother ?
I don &apos;t know why I said that .
Tom is quite busy now .
Do you want to go to Boston ?
How will you help Tom ?
I &apos;ll be better tomorrow .
Do you know why I ask that to you ?
Tom walked fast .
I am tired .
I was so cold .
You don &apos;t need to worry about me anymore .
Tom said he was ready to see him .
Tom left without everything .
Have you really talked to Tom ?
That &apos;s what you thought .
I wonder how that she &apos;ll get home .
I am tired of the work .
Tom is young .
You can sleep here if you want .
I don &apos;t understand why Tom has to do that .
Is your cold ?
I &apos;m sorry for what I &apos;ve done .
I was there yesterday .
Do you want to know what you have ?
You can &apos;t always make everyone happy .
We must do this right now .
I didn &apos;t see that coming .
I &apos;m going to school in Boston .
I &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
You don &apos;t look that good .
Tom thinks I love Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do anything .
Tom is not good .
I &apos;m never going to let me sing .
I like to eat .
I was busy .
I don &apos;t want to tell Tom the truth .
I don &apos;t have anything to do with this .
Tom won &apos;t sing .
What are they doing there ?
Please give me this .
It &apos;s not my day .
Do you know what his name is ?
How is it Tom ?
You &apos;ve been better too early .
Mary isn &apos;t my girlfriend .
Tom has a car , doesn &apos;t he ?
They &apos;re home .
The party was almost over .
Tom and I are about on this right now .
Tell Tom the truth .
Tom is nothing to play with .
I want to get to you .
Tom looks young , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;d like to see your hat .
You &apos;ve done a great job .
I &apos;ll visit you tomorrow .
It &apos;s something Tom made .
I am afraid .
Do you want to see my book ?
I love being with Tom .
I started working .
They don &apos;t need me anymore .
His whole country is like that .
Tom didn &apos;t go alone .
Do you really want to have children ?
I heard Tom is sick .
Tom is working with us .
Tom doesn &apos;t have a sister .
Tom says you &apos;re still the child as he can .
It wouldn &apos;t be the first time that that has happened .
What goes on in here ?
You won &apos;t swim .
Tom is much better than that .
It &apos;s one of mine .
Do you want me to go ?
Can I help me ?
I never asked for this .
Tom is a very man today .
I &apos;m sure Tom will tell Mary .
Tom did it all .
I can &apos;t keep you there .
Tom has no idea what has become of Mary .
Tom doesn &apos;t have time to talk to you .
He is always with me .
Tom is quite busy now , isn &apos;t he ?
I had no idea what to say .
I think Tom should stay .
Tom is getting ready .
It &apos;s not what you think .
I &apos;m not sure that I can swim that far .
Why are we doing that ?
She knows me .
We don &apos;t have all day .
I &apos;d love to stay .
I &apos;m not doing this for you .
I cannot tell them it .
Tom &apos;s up .
My parents are old .
You want it , don &apos;t you ?
You &apos;re not me .
You don &apos;t want this , do you ?
I haven &apos;t said anything .
Who gave that to you ?
The police are there .
I saw Tom there .
That &apos;s how Tom likes it .
Let me go with you .
My father is happy .
When were dinner ?
This is how we do it .
He came back two days .
Is that what I think it is ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what I am .
Tom never saw his father again .
Tom has a lot of time .
I like his house .
Tom got a job .
Tell Tom to come to Boston .
I think I can do .
I &apos;m coming home .
What we need is a little more water .
I &apos;m glad you like coffee .
I need to stop .
Did you forget ?
What &apos;s our plan ?
How big is Tom &apos;s doing ?
You should not talk here .
Tom may not be doing that .
Tom died just when I was very young .
I &apos;ve seen you here , so .
That &apos;s my brother .
What &apos;re we doing in here ?
I love my daughter .
I can &apos;t go .
How did you come to school ?
Tom is going to have to do that .
Your time is up .
Tom is in his room .
I &apos;ve been busy since yesterday .
I think I know someone who Tom .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to worry anymore .
Tom ate quickly .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
I think you should visit him .
You have to stop this .
I felt sorry for Tom .
Where &apos;s your money ?
Why am I so tired ?
Would you like to sing ?
Tom told me he had no money .
Do you have many friends in Australia ?
Tom has been a teacher since I hour .
You can do what you want .
I &apos;m not going to go to Boston with you .
My children can &apos;t speak French .
We need to talk about this .
They may come .
I &apos;ve never been too tired .
Did you find anything in the room ?
Everyone should like that .
It &apos;s not not here so .
We should &apos;ve helped Tom .
Did Tom eat ?
I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m not sure of anything .
Tom left for Australia every day .
You &apos;re doing that very fast .
You do look good .
Where &apos;s Tom &apos;s father ?
Tom says you &apos;ll go to Boston with us .
Tom will come to Mary again .
Come here .
I &apos;m not doing this here .
Tom may have said that , but I don &apos;t think so .
Tom said he saw Mary yesterday .
Tom is always happy .
The teacher go a letter .
I think I &apos;ll be going .
Tom and Mary have the same age .
That &apos;s what I want to know .
Let &apos;s talk over .
Is it far ?
You don &apos;t even know your name , do you ?
Tom is going to be fine .
What do you think it is true ?
You should see a doctor .
Where is he ?
There is a lot of food .
How is your sister ?
Tom went to see Mary in Boston .
I can &apos;t believe that I &apos;m here .
I believe in you .
No one should do as I can .
Tom and I were both busy right away .
I found it easy to speak English .
Tom told Mary that she shouldn &apos;t swim .
I want one about that .
The teacher was ten years old .
Where &apos;s the teacher ?
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
I &apos;m busy doing Tom .
Tom didn &apos;t say that .
I heard something .
Tom would often come to see me .
We can &apos;t talk here .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary to do that .
Tom did that three times .
My father will help me .
Do you have them ?
I love her .
Tom would love to see this .
This is happened .
It &apos;s time to go to school .
You don &apos;t have to go to school today .
I have a lot more books than Tom does .
Tom wants to know where you don &apos;t have to .
I didn &apos;t see it coming .
Tom used to do that .
I &apos;ll go and have a look .
I don &apos;t mean you .
I &apos;ve got good news .
Tom isn &apos;t happy here .
What happened to Tom ?
Do you want to see the house ?
I think we &apos;ve seen enough .
I can &apos;t even help .
Why doesn &apos;t Tom want you here ?
You don &apos;t have to go here .
There is no one in the house .
Tom wanted Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t have much money .
They &apos;ll find her .
Tom said that Mary doesn &apos;t do that .
Tom was up all night .
He told the truth .
I do not understand you .
That &apos;ll help .
He &apos;s a man now .
Tom wants to show you something .
I have one in the car .
What are you going to get ?
What time is your school ?
I didn &apos;t hear him coming .
Are you ready to talk about it ?
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with Tom .
I &apos;ll stay here as long as I can .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s idea .
I got a letter from it .
He doesn &apos;t like coffee .
We know how they are .
Thank you for being here .
Why aren &apos;t Tom and Mary coming ?
He &apos;s good at what he does .
You aren &apos;t here .
You &apos;re good at French , aren &apos;t you ?
It is almost three .
I understand what you mean .
I &apos;ve got to know .
What &apos;ve you got for me ?
Why do you think I &apos;m here ?
Why are you angry ?
I can &apos;t show you this .
Tom has gone for the room .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
Tom isn &apos;t at the hotel .
It &apos;s not my problem .
When &apos;s Tom going to do that ?
There wasn &apos;t anybody there .
I still don &apos;t know what happened .
I hope you know what this is .
Do you want to take it ?
My mother doesn &apos;t know .
Tom may be here .
What &apos;re you looking , Tom ?
Do you know where you are ?
Tom hardly ever make so happy .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me anything about you .
Tom doesn &apos;t have to talk about that if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I wish I could write tennis as well as Tom does .
Tom didn &apos;t want to buy anything .
It could be true .
Does Tom have a girlfriend ?
Tom doesn &apos;t have to do that now .
Tom has to stop doing this .
Tom came by car .
He kept me waiting for more than an hour .
Tom loves this .
I asked Tom to see me .
I could give it a try .
Tom has already finished the work .
Don &apos;t be late for school .
You really should &apos;ve done anything .
She came home very late .
I think she can help me .
How bad do you want it ?
Why shouldn &apos;t Tom leave ?
What could I say ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet told us what he told me .
Tom knows what he has to do .
I will do it myself .
She got no money .
Tom said he was afraid to do that .
Tom is no longer at home .
I go to work every morning .
Tom came outside .
He likes music a lot .
Tom read it for me .
You should tell him the truth .
There wasn &apos;t anything that I saw .
My French is not good at all .
Tom needs something .
I want Tom &apos;s money .
I think Tom needs your help .
I don &apos;t know what Tom does .
Tom came by .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t do that .
She has a few books .
It &apos;s been fun .
This question is too difficult for me .
Tom asked quite what Mary said was true .
This is my house .
They &apos;re afraid of him .
We were surprised by morning .
It is too Monday .
Let &apos;s see what happened .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t go .
I gave Tom one of those .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows where Mary is .
Tom can help us .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve have to stay there today .
He doesn &apos;t have a dog .
I really like you .
You &apos;ll find a job .
That is our school .
We have a long way to go .
I have a lot of friends .
Tom died at Mary home .
I &apos;ve been reading that car all afternoon .
Who would have it ?
I think that she knows the truth .
I love cake .
Don &apos;t you know that ?
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s family .
I no longer need to work .
Let him do it .
I &apos;d like to be young again .
Who is in this room ?
No one wanted to talk about it .
Tom had a son .
The girl has never happened .
I haven &apos;t heard Tom lived in Boston .
I need to know .
You heard us .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s here .
I can &apos;t stand .
I want to go to Boston with Tom .
I &apos;ll ask someone once .
We don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;d like you to be there .
Why does Tom want to do this ?
Tom must leave now .
Tom knows that you know .
I haven &apos;t found Tom yet .
Can we swim ?
What kind of people like you do ?
I know nothing about her .
We &apos;re from here .
I said I &apos;ll be fine .
The food is cold .
I don &apos;t like people like Tom .
I don &apos;t think Tom has a dog .
I haven &apos;t found it yet .
Get off here .
That is her house .
Tom came home .
I don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
I don &apos;t know what we need .
I know you like me .
That &apos;s important .
They &apos;ll see Tom .
You &apos;ll have to ask someone else .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I didn &apos;t see what happened .
What else do you know about Tom ?
There &apos;s a woman at you here .
He seems to be rich now .
You &apos;re old .
We &apos;ll go home .
You &apos;re my son .
Tom asked Mary for her to do that .
We know what they did .
I &apos;m very tired now .
Tom knows you .
She speaks English really well .
Tom has to go to the hospital .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better .
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
I won &apos;t be busy tomorrow .
What are you going to do to me ?
I already knew I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve eaten enough time .
I like to be around the news .
Where &apos;s my family ?
What &apos;s your teacher ?
I &apos;m happy for you two .
Tom seemed to be very happy here .
I didn &apos;t know anything about him .
I won &apos;t be well all all .
Will you have some more tea ?
What does this look like ?
I don &apos;t want to see Tom do that .
Tom is afraid of me .
I told you Tom would help .
What &apos;s Tom want me ?
I want to know what &apos;s good .
He was busy yesterday .
Tom never said that .
How far are you going ?
I don &apos;t ever go there anymore .
She made me a book .
I think that &apos;s the reason Tom loves me .
I had some fun .
Tom goes to school by bus .
Tom is now ready .
How &apos;s the weather ?
Tom looked at Mary and John was .
I never said anything like that .
I don &apos;t understand French .
I &apos;ll never be like Tom .
I forgot something in my car .
Tom was just trying to tell Mary the truth .
I only have a few questions .
Could you give me some more money ?
I &apos;ve been in the hospital for a week .
I have to get ready for work .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;ll like it .
He lost his homework .
There &apos;s fast .
I know you &apos;ll be happy here .
Where &apos;s my room ?
He met with his shoes .
What should Tom do ?
You don &apos;t speak English , do you ?
There has to be a way .
They &apos;ll probably come by car .
Have you already finished your homework ?
It &apos;s got to be now .
He has been in Japan for three years .
Tom gave us that .
He doesn &apos;t have to go to school .
I &apos;m not a bit off long .
We &apos;ll show you .
Where &apos;re the eyes ?
Do it the way I told you to .
No one will believe you .
The only one one had been that easy .
What do they want with us ?
I don &apos;t know Tom , but Mary don &apos;t have much .
That &apos;s better , isn &apos;t it ?
You should come with us .
I have no idea what Tom will know .
I said there &apos;s no one here .
The problem is over three years ago .
It &apos;s beautiful .
She lives with him .
They swim very quickly .
Do you want to get married ?
That &apos;s how I like it .
He seems to know nothing about the matter .
I know about Tom and Mary .
I &apos;m going to be a father .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what it is is .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
You don &apos;t have to believe me .
Can I get something to eat ?
I don &apos;t see him .
Where are you taking me ?
This needs to be done after me .
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow .
Do you know where he lives ?
My father is here .
Tom &apos;s here .
Is your mother back to school ?
Can you do that here ?
They &apos;ve seen Tom .
Is someone told us ?
What &apos;s all that ?
I don &apos;t know Tom all all .
I think someone &apos;s at the car .
It &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
Tom kept the at one .
I will do anything .
How do you like this town ?
Do you want my family ?
I saw nothing .
I didn &apos;t do anything .
Everyone &apos;s watching Tom .
I wish I had more time .
Tom loves coffee .
Tom looks happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
I haven &apos;t eaten anything yesterday .
You don &apos;t know what I want .
Why did Tom do this ?
I &apos;m right behind you .
I &apos;m going to help you .
You can &apos;t do everything .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go with Mary .
We &apos;ll find Tom .
You &apos;ll have to ask Tom that .
What else did you eat ?
There are people in the park .
I asked Tom to leave .
Is Tom still at school ?
I don &apos;t know what Tom has to do .
What happened out there ?
I haven &apos;t got a word with me .
I &apos;m going to go there .
She came out of the room .
Are you sure ?
Tom doesn &apos;t think that Mary is at home .
Tom said that he &apos;d help me .
I see that .
Don &apos;t show off .
I &apos;ll help you .
Tom wasn &apos;t the only person who doesn &apos;t want him .
I won &apos;t tell Tom what I want to do .
That &apos;s what I wanted to do .
I know that Tom likes Mary .
I have a girlfriend .
I don &apos;t ever want to speak to Tom again .
He took her by the story .
I have money .
I said that .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really .
How many times have I told you ?
Maybe we should try done .
We &apos;ll be happy .
Tom knows he has to do it .
Do you want to go with us ?
Tom is big .
We must do it now .
What does Tom expect ?
Is Boston far away ?
How do you like it ?
I &apos;ll ask Tom for you .
You can &apos;t give Tom that .
Is there anyone in the room ?
He really likes music a lot .
Tom wants to become a teacher .
Tom is not as young as I am .
Tom was the first .
Why isn &apos;t it here ?
Do you still have a plan ?
He doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
Why did you come home ?
He speaks English .
I was out all day .
Tom isn &apos;t going to Boston .
Come and see me if you have time .
It &apos;s very difficult .
Tom doesn &apos;t know me .
I thought I heard more .
There are still a lot of things to do .
Tom loves Mary .
I don &apos;t think Tom will come .
Is there anyone who who speaks ?
What time is it that you want to say ?
It &apos;s been a week .
I think it &apos;s time for me to leave .
We &apos;re worried .
Are you all all ?
I want Tom to come home .
I &apos;m afraid of my friends are yours .
Where &apos;s Tom gone ?
She wanted me to come .
I &apos;m not sure about this .
Tom left for my bed ten minutes ago .
Tom is wearing a hat .
Is Tom in on this ?
Why are we doing this ?
You are one of us .
It &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking .
It doesn &apos;t look like me anymore .
Why is that important ?
Do you want to see my room ?
This is her house .
My friends didn &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t have time for that .
How long have you been in Boston ?
I &apos;m not worried about it .
Tom has a brother in Boston .
Tom wanted to become a doctor .
I asked him to do that .
I &apos;m sure what Tom will be doing this .
I knew you &apos;d like it .
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can .
I do not have much money .
Tom knows I &apos;m home .
He went to school .
What &apos;s your father do ?
Why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
I &apos;m on her way to go to the park .
Why would Tom have to do it ?
I &apos;d already like to know what I did wrong .
This is my car .
They say Tom can do that .
I will never do it again .
I think you &apos;d like it in Boston .
Why are you still here ?
You must learn French .
There &apos;s your friend .
You did what had to be done .
She kept me waiting for a long time .
I think you have made a mistake .
I like you just the way you are .
Who was it that did that ?
What else can I do ?
I &apos;ve been here for three years .
What has Tom done wrong ?
Everyone knows us .
There are still of mistakes .
I &apos;ll come here again .
I knew you &apos;d get it .
Tom said he &apos;s a good .
That &apos;s the book I wanted to go to school .
I &apos;m here for Tom .
We don &apos;t have a daughter .
If I were you , I &apos;ll go right alone .
Tom has nothing to do with it .
What Tom said was .
We still have time .
Just say what you want to say .
I love him more than anything .
I didn &apos;t like Tom at all .
If I want as about you .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what I do .
I &apos;m well .
Tom is watching .
What about his girlfriend ?
Would you like to know how I did that ?
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re not here .
It isn &apos;t there .
I have no idea why Tom isn &apos;t here .
Just give it up .
Tom and Mary are often together .
Tom went to the hospital yesterday .
What else is there to say ?
We all make mistakes , right ?
You &apos;d better wait until tomorrow .
You can &apos;t even help me .
Is there anything else I need to know ?
I can &apos;t stay for long .
Tom has a pretty good home now .
Tom knew it .
Don &apos;t leave me alone .
When does Tom drive here ?
When will it be like ?
I was in bed .
I have exactly what you need .
They say it &apos;s up to you .
I need more .
Tom won &apos;t know .
Tom is often late for school .
Tom went to school with Mary .
You &apos;re late again .
Tom will be back on Monday .
I think I &apos;ll go home .
All bus is my office with me .
Did you find your book ?
Do you want to help Tom ?
I &apos;ve come here to help you .
Tom knows exactly what to do .
Tom wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
She went with him .
How long do I have to stay in the hospital ?
It &apos;s not always easy .
I &apos;m not the way .
How does he do this ?
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like .
I need you to leave now .

I wanted to learn French .
Do you have any books ?
They saw me .
We can still talk to Tom .
That &apos;s Tom &apos;s plan .
I have to go to the police again .
Why did you buy it ?
What are you going to give Tom to Tom ?
She doesn &apos;t speak English .
They know we &apos;re out here .
That &apos;s where Tom is .
I never want to talk to you again .
I shouldn &apos;t have eaten so much .
Tom isn &apos;t happy to be here .
That &apos;s what Tom does .
Do it tomorrow .
He won &apos;t really make a mistake .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom isn &apos;t back yet .
Tom says he wants to go to Boston .
Let me help you .
She &apos;s my daughter .
I don &apos;t know his name .
Why do you shouldn &apos;t do that to do that ?
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he said .
Tom wasn &apos;t there last week .
Tom has made a lot of friends .
I know Boston very well .
Tom is there , isn &apos;t he ?
I couldn &apos;t want to hear what he was doing .
I was just going to say that .

We &apos;re like a big family .
Where is Tom &apos;s car ?
I wanted to speak with Tom .
Have you heard about the accident ?
Give them money .
She talked a lot .
Tom is coming with us to school .
Tom made his parents happy .
I don &apos;t know what I should do .
You &apos;re from Boston , aren &apos;t you ?
That isn &apos;t really going to happen , by it ?
Is Tom ready ?
I love him every day .
Do you remember who I am ?
Tom said he heard Mary do that .
Can &apos;t you swim at all ?
I gave up to Tom .
I can &apos;t be a bit .
That &apos;s good to do it .
Why don &apos;t you go home ?
I told Tom to help Mary .
Tom knows what Mary likes .
Tom , I want you to for you .
I can &apos;t take you to school now .
I made Tom go home .
I don &apos;t want to talk about my dog .
I &apos;ll be happy to do it .
How can this be ?
They &apos;re brother and sister .
Tom knew how to do that .
Tom would like to have a girlfriend .
I thought Tom had enough money .
I ate too much yesterday .
I can understand what she is saying .
It &apos;s better you don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s just enough .
This one &apos;s good .
Tom found something .
Tom has to go .
I can do this all night .
Tom got here early .
I got a lot to say .
Does Tom know how to do that ?
Where am I ?

I &apos;m better than him .
How can I get to ?
You &apos;re not ready for this .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
Tom needs to go to the hospital .
Tom had never been so busy already .
The girl said nothing .
This isn &apos;t your car .
I know how busy this is like to me .
I want to try .
She is going to have a baby .
I want to go there again .
We &apos;ll be here .

Tom can help do that work .
I love French .
I saw Tom take it .
My mother can &apos;t drive a car .
We &apos;ll be living in Boston .
I &apos;d like to talk to Tom .
Tom is too busy to come .
I have no idea who was .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything ?
Tom went to go to Boston .
They &apos;re watching .
He can &apos;t buy himself a car .
Where did you go to school ?
I really don &apos;t want to live here .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Tom knows how to get a house .
I have nothing else .
We &apos;re not going to do that again .
I don &apos;t have enough money to buy it .
She wanted to help them .
Nobody lives in this house anymore .
I have nothing to do this afternoon .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
You could have come to me .
I haven &apos;t met him .
I didn &apos;t know what I should say to Tom .
I had no idea you were here .
It is a good thing to do .
I said Tom loves me to be rich .
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
What you did made Tom do .
I don &apos;t even know where she lives with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t know why Mary isn &apos;t here today .
Why do you think that ?
I have to know what &apos;s going on .
Tom says he is rich .
What &apos;s your name ?
Tom wants to work for Mary .
Please keep the school off .
What &apos;s your mother like ?
I went into the house .
I just don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French at all .
I can &apos;t do it anymore .
I wrote a letter to Boston .
That &apos;s my plan .
Do you want to study with Tom ?
He could do it .
Why are we really ?
I think he is a doctor .
Where &apos;s my watch ?
They say that he &apos;s very rich .
You should stop that .
It &apos;s out of the question !
Tom had no water to drink .
I don &apos;t need your help .
I &apos;m for it .
I &apos;m worried for you .
We &apos;ve been asked to help .
How long ago is it late ?
Why are you so happy ?
I might be able to help you .
The work was very difficult .
I &apos;ve seen them .
I need you to drive me in the country .
We &apos;re with you .
I &apos;ll see you on Monday .
They had nothing to eat .
I don &apos;t like the house .
I was at work .
I need to talk with Tom .
Nobody does it better .
I found one of what Tom is doing .
I &apos;m not able for school .
Why are you really here ?
Tom knew I &apos;d be there .
When do I get to go home ?
We study French at school every day .
What a time for this ?
You hardly ate anything .
You should have done so .
What do you do to do ?
I want to read that book .
That &apos;s not Tom .
Nobody had an answer .
I was in Australia last week .
This isn &apos;t a game .
I don &apos;t like anything here .
This book is easy enough for them .
We only have tea .
Let me finish such Tom .
What were you doing at the hospital ?
Tom doesn &apos;t need to come if he doesn &apos;t want to .
I love this one .
This is really big .
They won &apos;t know .
Did Tom give you something ?
It &apos;s already late .
She does not do everything .
It was there there .
He &apos;s afraid of making mistakes .
He is free from time .
No one said anything .
She loves off .
I &apos;ve seen this picture before .
Tom seemed fine .
What exactly has Tom done ?
You should have seen it .

I don &apos;t think we need that .
We &apos;re all done .
I talked to Tom meet Tom .
Would you like to know who did it ?
Did you study French yesterday ?
Tom loves my work .
What do you see into your house ?
Come back here .
What is it that Tom wants to do ?
We &apos;ve seen it before .
They don &apos;t make your happy .
You can swim , but I can &apos;t .
Tom has been like a father to me .
She is a friend of my wife .
You don &apos;t need to go to school .
I know who he is .
I think I &apos;ve made a mistake .
I &apos;d like to read your new car .
This is the watch .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary the truth .
I don &apos;t know why you want me to do that .
I love you not a teacher .
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to help him .
What &apos;re you doing with my car ?
What &apos;s Tom after ?
They won &apos;t find Tom there .
Do you have a friend who can help you ?
I told Tom that I was late .
Let &apos;s get back to work .
He was never back back again .
Are you sure you don &apos;t need them help ?
Tom wasn &apos;t surprised .
Tom says he can swim .
I want you to be with me .
Tom doesn &apos;t have enough friends .
Tom got through the watch at the world .
He knows the truth .
I don &apos;t know that .
Tom wasn &apos;t rich .
That &apos;s how we want you to do it .
Where was Tom born ?
Do you know something about Tom ?
That &apos;s not easy .
Did you see Tom ?
It was it that I &apos;m cold .
He sat in front of me .
That is what I have to buy .
What &apos;s your daughter &apos;s name ?
It &apos;s very difficult to learn Tom .
Is it possible ?
Tom looked young .
We just need money to do it .
Do you know where Tom was born ?
He asked me for help .
How are we going to help Tom ?
I just don &apos;t know what to say .
What were on ?

You don &apos;t need to wait .
She is wearing a hat .
