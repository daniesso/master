Be nice to my father .
How do you know so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to help .
I can &apos;t want from talking to Tom .
I think it &apos;s not good to me .
This isn &apos;t very difficult .
You aren &apos;t just me , but I can trust .
Is he coming to you ?
I come today .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so good at you .
I think you can trust it .
Tom wanted to sell his car on Monday .
They are not fat .
It looks like to see Tom .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that because I did that .
He looks tired this afternoon .
Did Tom die ?
Give them some money .
Tom wrote to me twice .
Did Tom walk home night ?
Tom said he thought he wanted to ask .
I didn &apos;t know how you should do it .
There is an horse .
He will arrive in Paris .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be done a long long .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to call the police .
You &apos;ve got a lot to be here .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have a car in this .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he speaks French .
Why can &apos;t I do that ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t seem to school .
The shop was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you have lunch ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t know if it happened to Tom .
I am as tall as Tom .
It three times almost started .
I love my brothers .
Today and I have a lot of things .
If that &apos;s about that , Tom .
I see the weather in Boston .
Why are you so worried ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be that .
Tom looked angry .
The girl sitting on the bed .
I think you look good .
Were you in love ?
Tom didn &apos;t even know .
She goes to the movies with Tom .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his best .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing great .
Are you called ?
May I try it ?
I just spoke to her .
I have never done this before .
The child is cold .
Tom is like to live in the city .
The baby is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think I speak French as you .
Could you give me some money ?
She took off his watch .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would be hit .
Tom died yesterday yesterday .
You read too much .
All of you were Tom .
Tom said that Mary could speak French .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a lot of you you .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat lunch .
What are you doing not ?
There &apos;s very little difficult left .
Are they there there ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is a good person .
He looks older than he is .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on this ?
Tom likes these things .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now to leave .
Are you finished the door ?
I forgot to see your name .
Tom and Mary sat together .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it car not to Tom ?
I have to do it myself .
Let &apos;s tell what I don &apos;t know .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
&quot; Is Tom one time to need ?
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work this evening .
I have never been done .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed off the plan .
He won &apos;t take sure that hard .
I &apos;ve made my bed before .
Tom didn &apos;t know his name .
He seemed to be in a bad mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may sit there .
Tom looked like to read .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did I buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t open the door .
Is this your book ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom won &apos;t make me to help me for me .
No one laughed .
I &apos;m reading a letter from you .
I bought a camera two hours .
That &apos;s another answer .
I know your father .
I like playing golf .
He is said by everybody .
I have many friends to help .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming home tomorrow .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary yesterday .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t like his children .
You were here , haven &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cars .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you can believe me .
I was busy on Tom .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t true .
How come you not talking to Tom ?
I am afraid of Tom .
What &apos;s going on here ?
When should I live ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also speaking French .
Do you really want to go home ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary left to Mary .
We almost really know Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please be quiet !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going to the movies .
Tom and his friends live in Boston .
You can &apos;t fire Tom , can you ?
It looked like Tom and Mary left .
I &apos;d say for you .
You should have done that .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a party by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems stopped raining .
You &apos;re really good , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve seen Tom home .
I &apos;d like a job .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want to ask me ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could eat more time .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been waiting for you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven .
Why are you coming , too ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t think that is easy .
Tom is going to help us .
Are you married all ?
I understand that Tom does .
How will you take telling me ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than Mary .
Don &apos;t look at me anymore .
Can you drive the car ?
It was a pencil we left .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I want to talk to Tom ?
I &apos;ll make it won .
There is a cat in Australia .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are Tom &apos;s home .
I &apos;d rather not go shopping today .
This has a problem .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got convinced good to Mary .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you bring this in your family ?
I know .
Those are on Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What are going on going to the future ?
I &apos;m not sure that Tom is right .
My father made me the car .
I &apos;m trying to help Tom .
We &apos;ll be in love with Tom .
Let &apos;s go on .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my friend .
Tom was nearly half enough .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary are brothers .
I was just going to say that .
Tom watched it himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go to school .
How many people are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had been here for dinner tonight .
Tom seemed lost .
Go on .
That was really ready .
Every car is at his age .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played baseball yesterday .
Tom died in October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
Please call every night .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s nothing he wants to see .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there yesterday .
He called me later .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom feel ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s name .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m doing it .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell the truth .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be like Tom .
I play the letter milk .
The baby was sleeping .
I asked him to help me .
May I ask Tom ?
Don &apos;t tell them Tom .
You were worried , I would like to .
How beautiful I am ?
Give him anything .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom to drive there ?
It &apos;s cold .
Why is life so ?
The family is busy .
Why didn &apos;t Tom tell me what to do ?
I must swim French .
Tom is very poor .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been a new car now .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The boy lives early yesterday .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need money anymore .
I asked the teacher .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m glad to speak French well .
I know that the man are hungry .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m going to see Tom there .
Do you want to know more ?
We have married a lot .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this time yours ?
Tom left the same age as Mary .
What does Tom know about Mary ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak to write on English .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can do whatever you like .
Tom noticed Mary left the bus .
What do you look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was just tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t want to do that anymore .
Tom doesn &apos;t like that .
You both die .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m just worried .
Get trying to the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
Why does you go home ?
Tom and Mary seem to be very happy together .
You can me so .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll be back back .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know your life .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that Mary is in love .
I didn &apos;t buy anything about it .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
They look my age .
Tom can &apos;t sing .
Maybe Tom didn &apos;t speak to Mary .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really sure anymore .
He took off my mind .
I don &apos;t like this .
She went straight home .
I only have two children .
He left everything of my children .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston now .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something in your office .
I need something to eat with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new bicycle .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he could love it .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who Tom is .
What are you up to ?
Tom can &apos;t swim .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I can &apos;t be afraid of him .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he did .
Those me live happy .
Tom thought that Mary would come .
There is no one .
Tom is looking in Australia .
This train was closed .
Maybe we &apos;ll be quiet .
Are you ready now ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was not poor .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one in the park .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it down that the matter .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that going to your York ?
It happens all the time for you .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your train ?
I &apos;d love to see Tom .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could you say that ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the doctor ?
You aren &apos;t a good friends .
Tom hardly understood anything at all .
There is a good day .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another cup of beer ?
I knew a lot from them .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll write the letter .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a bed .
Tom seems lucky .
I &apos;m not not to tell Tom the truth .
They live to each country .
The baby was rather close .
Give me a day .
Why are you working to Tom ?
You two yourself now .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to sleep .
I do not like Tom .
I wonder whether I should help me .
We can &apos;t make a decision of that .
When is Tom coming ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve just lost it .
He worked all the whole day .
Tom got what he loved .
I can &apos;t get the last train .
Can you tell me something ?
I wish I could get it .
Where &apos;s your friend ?
Tom found my shirt .
Are you there ?
Tom asked Mary to help Mary all question .
I wonder whether he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are proud of things .
I know it &apos;s someone .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be best before ?
Please don &apos;t be here with me .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived earlier than usual .
Do you really want to do me ?
The dog looks cute .
Are you the best ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know that I did that .
Who did you drive there ?
Why don &apos;t you take up with you ?
Tom isn &apos;t even young .
What &apos;re you saying ?
What happened to Tom isn &apos;t true .
Tom is good at telling me .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to Boston tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does Tom have to do with my family ?
Tom walked over .
The boy died off .
Tom got to fire Mary in trouble .
Tom went back to Mary &apos;s room .
What do I do next on ?
Tom isn &apos;t doing that .
If you &apos;d it left this .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it could happen .
We &apos;ve been asked to me .
Tell me everything .
We can speak French .
I know I &apos;m working now .
Tom was sitting in a small town .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made me eyes .
You &apos;re the only person I &apos;ve ever kissed .
How did you come here ?
Where do you know Tom from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three hours .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never heard Tom &apos;d live .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be sure about Mary .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing we should do .
When you did want it .
You made me happy , haven &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t call me .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t made a joke .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to take a long time .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His car keeps mine .
Tom fell away and six .
Tom always eats by his parents .
Are you being paid for something ?
They sell my dog .
She did not tell anyone about Tom .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one has changed .
I didn &apos;t drink that book .
You have to see this .
Where will you be your help ?
We &apos;ll see Tom there .
Tom helped Mary in the room .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can &apos;t hear to eat anything .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This car is fast .
I &apos;m pretty sure Tom doesn &apos;t like it .
Tom could have to tell Mary everything .
This makes you go .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never really friends friends .
I found this book .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not happy about Tom .
I just came to say we say .
We have a big TV .
How was hours there ?
He spent three years in prison .
He will soon a teacher .
Tom showed his daughter .
This is a very big country .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s with me ?
You &apos;re taller than Tom .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll have told me earlier .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a plan in Boston .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is beautiful today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take that for the matter .
I will call you for a while .
What a good idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s feelings ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The two of are here .
Tom promised Mary that he needed something to do that .
What you said I didn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t think if you &apos;re busy .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s look around there .
Don &apos;t ever say that again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what to do , he does .
It is here .
There &apos;s gotten too much for you .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what I do to tell you .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied .
You were just , I wouldn &apos;t tell .
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to see you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me to me so much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m busy .
I come from China .
That &apos;s mine .
I &apos;ve been here .
Tom is now on time .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to see this telephone .
I &apos;d love to buy something to you .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you .
I am ready .
I have some coffee .
Who will you go in bed ?
How was you happy ?
She will come soon .
I &apos;m convinced for my son .
He &apos;s like playing golf .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase on .
I came here you both .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new car .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to speak to you the police .
How many people have to do your homework ?
It was too easy .
Who sent Tom ?
I &apos;m trying to explain something to Tom .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to say something .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not doing that .
You don &apos;t have to go there .
Your plan is dangerous .
Tom got off almost a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re here to save Tom now .
Can we speak French ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how you come .
She &apos;s a good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take a break .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have to go to Boston with Tom .
I feel bad to learn this .
Tom was sitting on the bus .
How many cats are you here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t believe Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that from ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll play tennis with the bus .
Now I apologize .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be if you were at your age .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do whatever I have to say .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does without saying that before .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;ve been to Europe .
How many pictures were run ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s very cold .
How long will you be here ?
Tom goes to bed .
If Tom doesn &apos;t do this , too .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to find him to the station .
Why did you pay it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I &apos;ll miss Tom .
You &apos;re new right now .
The girl went to sleep .
Put off my glasses .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is that my plan ?
I wish I was dead .
Can come out of you ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t good to me .
Tom needs the money .
Where do you know that ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the story .
It was just a problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in that kind of music .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never loved you .
I don &apos;t drive much .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I came to Tom won .
Who sent you that ?
We have to work .
Give me the matter with me .
Tom loves going to school .
They were afraid .
She wondered her that she was her to blame .
How do you know I don &apos;t have to go ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you out of Mary ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the meeting .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have lost her .
What makes you planning to stay one ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not all .
I pretended to work .
As soon got on up .
What are you doing in Boston ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good time .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was stupid to understand .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about you ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t ever ever arrived .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live .
Tom wants to see us again .
When I saw you in the place !
I think most life is right now .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m studying with her .
Tom was a little guilty .
My mother is all there .
What is your beer ?
I &apos;m Canadian .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell looks young .
I have to go alone .
She knows a lot of animals .
Tom did that earlier .
You have to run as fast as possible .
Tom is doing something he wants to .
What you do to buy that ?
I remember the money .
You said you Tom was busy .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a couple of days .
That looks like .
Tom didn &apos;t give my shoes .
We aren &apos;t already done today .
Ask them .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be .
I play there .
I have not read this book .
It &apos;s be over there .
Tom isn &apos;t hungry .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get back .
It looks great .
When I was reading to Tom .
Tom walked late .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked to wait .
What &apos;s in there ?
There is hope !
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new car .
That lake is in the desk .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he wanted to learn too much .
The book will take this .
Can you come to Boston ?
Tom and Mary were very busy .
Your French is really full .
It isn &apos;t good .
Take along the book .
I &apos;ve got this to have this problem .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with my father .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of them .
That &apos;s no reason .
You &apos;re probably supposed to help .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
I &apos;ve got good like this .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had more time .
Is it your family ?
I &apos;m not afraid of you .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you want to be here in the town ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat fruit .
It was getting !
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
He works very much one .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time .
I know why Tom will arrive here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom .
I &apos;ve already told Tom everything .
You are better at swimming .
Tom was sitting on the couch side .
I couldn &apos;t live without her .
I do not like this .
&quot; Are you done ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what &apos;s happening .
It looks like it .
This is probably going to know .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was stolen .
I &apos;m not afraid of you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s happy .
It is Monday .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is her mother .
I want to talk to you and someone .
I like my leg .
What makes you think of Tom ?
Did Tom eat dinner ?
I must get to work .
The children are hungry .
I left the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for several years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all .
Do you want me to tell you ?

Would you mind him alone ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to the party .
He is proud of sure .
Tom looked great .
Please go straight slowly .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is red .

Tom and I were up all night .
How long can you stay here ?
She &apos;s about my age .

Are we still here ?
I study French at home .

I &apos;ve got a good idea to you .
I had fun .
You know I love you .

Everyone wants to be loved .

Tom ran to sleep .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need some help tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A few things is cute .
Tom knew that he had been ill .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The only one I saw is true .
I quit smoking .
I have there .
They have another chance .
I think I &apos;ve been working for .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting it ?
I &apos;m glad you brought it .

They lost them .
Where can I buy apples ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be true .
I &apos;m so busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d love you .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?

His sister is famous .
You don &apos;t need to worry about everything .
Are you still mad ?
In the children are married .
They left me .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t seem along .
Tom asked dinner .
Tom is already waiting for me .
My mother is busy now .
Mary stood on the same mistake .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was so simple .
I didn &apos;t ask anyone to help me .
How good are you ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not too far from here .
Tom has been here for three hours .
Do you feel like cooking ?
Maybe Tom did it .
Tom is a very good cook .

She was my first girlfriend .
When do you know about me ?
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I have to love this work ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never done something like that before .
Be Mary .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is not in the hospital .
Tom started swimming here .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to visit Boston .
Let &apos;s not talk to you anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was surprised by everybody .
You said whether Tom did it .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How Tom does to go to Boston .
Tom can hardly work now .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come there , Tom .
Tom seems interested in a joke .
I can fix yourself .
The door was closed .
No one wants to go home .
When was it that you ?
Please do not play here .
Tom should &apos;ve told Mary his best .
Can you speak to my house ?
I have not read that long .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something else .
How do you have all the night ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems lucky .
Tom is three years older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no one who he lives .
Tom is better than you .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat took up to fire .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
We aren &apos;t there .
I do you have never come the whole day .

The man sitting on that bench is Mary .
Don &apos;t be afraid of yourself .

We &apos;ve run out of money .

I &apos;m still afraid of him .
Today is my friend &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy now .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of music ?
This is fine .
I loved that house .
Tom told everyone he knew it .
Tom lived in Australia for three years .
I &apos;m not free by my back .
I love you people .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they studying ?
He gave me his money .
Those are Tom &apos;s .
Where &apos;s the new car ?
We can &apos;t have a lot of pictures .
He showed a walk .
You &apos;re a little nervous right now .
I know you &apos;re convinced .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to speak so much .
Tom got to love him .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this door .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that anymore .

It is three years .
Tom did not agree with Tom .

Who hasn &apos;t yet go ?
You &apos;re Tom &apos;s .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made a teacher .
Tom didn &apos;t have much to me .
That &apos;s the best question I have .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
What it is ?
Tom has nothing to change .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to tell you ?
Tom told me that he wouldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the piece of paper .
I was ready again .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m really hungry .
He knows the way that .
Tom got to see me there .
You &apos;d better leave .
Tom will always hurry .
This book is worth reading .
We don &apos;t care what he is .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to me .
Tom is looking for his age .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let &apos;s speak French to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .

Can your parents speak French ?
Can you tell me what Tom is doing ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be back again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand where Mary left .
I think I &apos;ll see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do you live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose friend is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell Tom that Mary .
I can &apos;t say that today .

That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , too .
I know you &apos;re afraid to me .
Tom is going to take care of it .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her daughter is pretty very good .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t get this done .
We just don &apos;t know very hard .
I was there .
How Tom said this isn &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother is always angry .
I just came to give you everything .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you guys like me .
I &apos;m proud to be a doctor .
Let Tom come .

The baby is fast .
The car is ready .
It all enough .
My cat is white .
It makes sense .
What country did it ?
Why are you doing this ?
They &apos;re almost half drunk .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This room is empty .
What do you want to tell me ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to have any questions .
Where would you like to go next Monday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you say ?
I think Tom will win .

Did you really say that ?
How was it ?

We know what &apos;s going to live .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .

That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s getting water .
If you are speaking French , you can .
There is a cat on the desk .
I can &apos;t believe you like Tom .
Tom was already drunk .
We don &apos;t understand anything anymore .
You can solve last week .
These are yours , too .
What kind of flowers ?
Tom didn &apos;t expect Mary to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t supposed to help .
Tom refused to sleep .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten to stay alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even learn that far .
I am totally afraid of you .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can &apos;t talk to you .
Tom found the key he works in .
Tom loved doing that .
What are these people doing this ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you coming on ?
It &apos;s totally hope tonight .
Do you have a telephone ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the first time you .
Tom , Mary would have married us .
We &apos;ll be friends .
I do not care about it .
Tom asked us everything .
He loves talking to music .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was a beautiful dress .
We had fun of them .
Can we try this ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to show my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who Tom is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Where did you have three children ?
Tom gave Mary everything .
I hope that I will win .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your French is like your best .
I &apos;ve been working here for Tom .
Do you know what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I &apos;ve heard .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it to me .
Can you remember the answer that ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is too short .
You do not want to do that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to me ?
No one lives .
I &apos;m going to be here with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I need it .
Boston did not speak French , Tom .
My cat fell at seven o &apos;clock .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
We understand them .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the man who works .
Tom will take care of it .
Every dictionary is on the desk .
How come you didn &apos;t live here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston do ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my teacher .
I &apos;d have not ask if I had to apologize .
I can &apos;t sleep today .
This is about the accident .
Have you told Tom that ?
I found my brother .
Tom and Mary sat together .
You &apos;re too busy .
It &apos;s mine up .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
Everyone knows without his age .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Tom had trouble .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom ask ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like it .
Tom has left the bus .
It &apos;s not be as much as you know .
I have no one to answer about that .
Who said I left the keys ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
When could you show a taxi ?
How well were you come home ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know where to pay ?
Tom is coming to the party .
Tom has three friends .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d love enough to you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to sing a fine life .
This boy is very old .
That girl didn &apos;t have a problem .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s address .
Look at Tom .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How many hours are you ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that I forgot .
He knew it all to happen .
The rain last night .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I know who that to make that .
This is one easy on .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question .
This road &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d only read your answer .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t go to the meeting .
He &apos;s very rich .
Tom isn &apos;t going to work .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at Tom .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom turned out to play his mind .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I spoke just I didn &apos;t kiss Tom , but I wasn &apos;t invited .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this your school ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know you is happy .
I haven &apos;t seen that dogs .
Tom said Mary was very poor .
Be careful .
I now and I speak to you .
My mother has been sick for a long time .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has happened .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know who you can &apos;t do that .
I &apos;d like to know something .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you want to know ?
Tom was glad to take a taxi .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t decided to wear married .
I told you that you should help you advice .
You should learn here .
Where is the bad news ?
That &apos;s exactly Tom .
Can I take your word for it ?
&quot; What &apos;s not one ?
I was sleeping .
Tom wants to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d asked to help .
What time do you usually leave there ?
Are Tom and Mary ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won .
If you don &apos;t love time to yourself .
To tell you the truth , I would do it .
Tom looks like he &apos;s innocent .
Tom knows I &apos;m afraid .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we think it is ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get there .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend now .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How are they ?
I &apos;d like to ask for you .
Tom should go help you .
Her cat is my grandfather .
Tom could barely speak .
Tom put on some clothes .
You can give him a bicycle .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed .
I was at home .
His book is full .
I &apos;m now Tom .
I usually go home .
That sounds like a lot from today .
It &apos;s on the desk .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me .
Isn &apos;t that sweet ?
I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s mine .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to work for a walk .
Tom is a friend of my wife &apos;s .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d always come .
I know a lot about it .
I took you out of the room .
Tom bought a picture of his dog .
I know how long you have been a long time .
You can make me do it .
Tom said that he enjoyed Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I am to do without .
What could I say ?
Tom has more time .
He is taller than his brother .
They almost got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The boy is small at home .
There &apos;s only one .
How will I find it ?
Go under the sofa .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I found your money on this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough money .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know who it is .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She is younger than us .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder what Tom does .
Tom has been married .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a minute ?
What you got , too ?
It would take for him .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find somebody .
Thanks for your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant something .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Our boys went to the park .
That &apos;s their mistake .
I think we need more time .
I saw it .
I can &apos;t read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her .
I think Tom might be back back before .
I &apos;d like to have a talk with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe .
Tom was in the room .
I take my heart .
