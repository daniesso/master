Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to do before I left .
I can &apos;t say of anything I could have .
I think it &apos;s too important to happen .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve almost finished all the matter with me , but I don &apos;t know what I do .
Is he going to make it ?
That man !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s what you tell me the truth .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me that he was out on Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you feel a bit French .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call one book ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t doing in doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats sleeping on the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house long .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The room was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom doesn &apos;t remember jokes at his party .
It suddenly suddenly left .
I love my brothers and death .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very rich .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The trip was on the table .
I think they are good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to leave her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is beautiful .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows how to cook .
Could you give me some salt ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would be about about three hours .
Tom smiled , but Mary laughed .
You read too much .
All of them are well .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem for you .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat more than my boyfriend .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very little left the window came .
Are we getting there out ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was late , too .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea without coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played together all day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it very cold here ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
We alone don &apos;t talk to me .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work with this time .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand back out so .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your suitcase here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this all please ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like .
Tom came to my face to talk with me .
No one believed .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a camera two minutes .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like smoking hair and drinking lunch .
He is liked by game .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never come .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the like .
I was able to sing without Tom and Mary .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll do ?
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was far from true .
When should I say the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m to be there .
Do you really want to stay here for a long time ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom convinced .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s out there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looked like Tom &apos;s in his room , doesn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;d say go , too .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really happy , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to do .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you interested in here ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How about your train usually usually left ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that joke at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me a house ?
It was a fine day .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big sleep early early .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to school here .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been in the end .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very good at what he was saying .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you bring these in a box ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say is what people have ?
I &apos;m not sure if I &apos;re here today .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom .
We were very disappointed in that girl .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t yet yet .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are with ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known me if I had to tell you the truth .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s a bad idea .
That was really fun .
He always eats lunch in a time .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in weeks winter .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat is five minutes .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who loves you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this looks like Tom .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called earlier .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How good is Tom ?
Give us three weeks .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life like ?
The chair is filled with others .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The bike is there after ten minutes .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t drink beer anymore .
I let the cat written to Tom .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed that how well .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really sure that Tom isn &apos;t going .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter to cry .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this possible ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak English into the night .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I will tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything you like .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished the meeting .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can use your age .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t win .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them all .
Tom hates Boston .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t sleep until it was too expensive .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This window has been broken for a long time .
Do you really want to help ?
We &apos;re not not supposed to be here in this time .
He took back what he had about her .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the man standing across the street .
I only have two children .
If you &apos;re all my friends , I &apos;s a very good at it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way Tom speaks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those girls know him do such a thing .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no clock in my room .
Tom was afraid of me .
That could be worse .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat and fish in English ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had a knife on his life .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that your glasses ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your name ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the favor ?
You aren &apos;t like the way .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the head .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave as soon as I finish this .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s .
They enjoy one of another .
The doctor seemed to be fast asleep .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two like really kind of thing .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to Germany .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I could help his feelings .
We can &apos;t be good at Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you speaking French ?
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are a bad people .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be possible again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two doing ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we pick me in face ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
I talk to Tom isn &apos;t true .
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s license .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as he think he is .
If you &apos;d asked me for it , I would have given it to you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t feel like it .
We &apos;ve been looking to do that .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in love now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , too .
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I knew .
How did you come up with such a thing ?
Where do I know ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s sleep .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said he &apos;ll do it again .
The little girl did nothing .
You gave Tom a present , didn &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t let me .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream won &apos;t be true .
Tom closed his eyes and began .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you expecting you for something ?
They all look the same .
She wrote to stay present .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time ?
We were studying all morning .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is dead .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This can &apos;t do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I found this book very seriously .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not talking about Tom .
I just wanted to say thank you .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in Australia .
He will become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very tall tall .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice plan dancing together .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the truth or not .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good friends to work .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is supposed to rain today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a long time .
What a good idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The lake is in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that without sugar .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in that .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly any room left .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you do , you have to do this .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He forgot to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to remember this at home .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I am ready .
I have some things I need to write .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just a bit .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a lot more shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom and Mary girlfriend ?
I &apos;m sure that Tom likes to talk on his own .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so much .
Your children have him .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three days .
Can &apos;t anything called ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his daughter .
I have enough time to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get with these shoes ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great to handle this .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as long as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many books did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too expensive .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re here to see me , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that fire .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can these of what you say ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t live in Australia .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than Mary .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t ever see Tom .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the right to me .
Tom loves going to Tokyo .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the station .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you so Tom &apos;s certain ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last summer .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as he comes back , let me know .
What does you see in your place ?
I wanted to speak with you .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to you tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When I knew the age , he was drunk .
I think what you need something to say .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the time of this ?
I &apos;m cold .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even his heart , he doesn &apos;t know very well .
He did that for you done .
You have to start as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That news knows .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We wasn &apos;t ever done .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not eat anything to eat since this morning .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary know John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything and ask .
It looks great .
Today &apos;s like to play the guitar .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that bottle ?
There isn &apos;t any difference between the two .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That movie is very surprised .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book was full last summer .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have in bed .
Your French is quite good .
It isn &apos;t as important as you are .
Take the dog for you .
I &apos;ve got this picture .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got to do with the matter with you .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not until this morning .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book seemed interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be here .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to do this .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just played tennis now .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat meat when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So where were you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what has become of me .
It looks as good is it .
This is just the right way to me .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I like the way you came .
What were you doing when I came to Japan ?
Can you write a letter ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like telling him what I think about him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a cup of coffee .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s better news .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s right .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you like any ice cream ?
I think that Tom speaks French .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Most people students are dead .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were both waiting .
How many times do you think here ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your book ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did we get married when they were in Boston ?
I &apos;ve got a good idea not .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report by tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of students were in the pocket .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be in Boston with the end of the accident .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The town &apos;s very warm .
I read several books .
I have a strong cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom and Mary decided anything .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no advice .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
&quot; anyone believe Tom . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t decide . &quot;
They grew angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is for you .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years .
You don &apos;t need to worry about what happened .
Are you still mad ?
In some sleep and sleep .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t out .
Tom asked us to wait until he was sleeping .
Tom is a very good friend .
My mother went to school right now .
Tom stole on the same things .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was meant too easy .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that long .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom liked Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t hurt his father .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but John didn &apos;t come .
She was the first girl I &apos;d kissed .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this coffee ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone something like that .
Both those children are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the way .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that you want ?
Tom died to save our life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I asked you to do ?
Tom can &apos;t remember without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom &apos;s .
Tom seems interested in nothing else .
I can &apos;t remember what to convince Tom .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Can you show me where you live on the island ?
I have not take a taxi last night .
That isn &apos;t coming .
I learned something today .
How come he didn &apos;t tell up ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than Mary .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My children ran into earlier and wasn &apos;t up .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do you have a knife to me on the car .
He stood up to carefully .
The man playing on that bench is Tom .
Don &apos;t be surprised .
He helped me the rules .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
I can &apos;t go to Boston with Tom .
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary both students each other friends .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just convince Tom .
He &apos;s so tall studying English .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my night &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss him then , too .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you called .
I love you .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new idea ?
We can &apos;t have you out of those people .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new around here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really drunk .
I &apos;ve actually actually who has a lot of stuff .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to hurt .
Tom seems angry .
It is their cold .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom probably won swim in Boston today .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right right away .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the best movie I have written .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this fish ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with it ?
Tom told me that he thought I wanted to be interested in Boston .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was busy last week .
He knows the stuff well .
Tom was asleep by himself for the bed .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is worth reading and again .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t know that , can &apos;t .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m tired .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have bad news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the bus open .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom made you any time ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel like studying French .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it now ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off next morning .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How don &apos;t he hit it ?
Thanks to you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never meant to be you in this class .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to have anything to do with me .
Tom said he was on the way .
Can anybody speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary hates him .
I think I need to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you her name .
I can &apos;t say anything without time .

Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the fish you was born .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for a long time now .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have a problem ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son will succeed for sure .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to try very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary can speak French ?
I don &apos;t think I like me .
My mother always wanted him to be so hungry .
I just wanted to say thank you for your help .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you are here .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them all come .
Tom says I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several other friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with Mary .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It &apos;s getting in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is nothing in Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost three times from many people .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How come !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last night .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What country are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that I saw at Boston ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please tell my parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your school .
When are you going home ?
I wish I could figure up my French .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of that .
Tom heard someone laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it up .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that Tom Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The night is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you say that ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father drives old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your salt ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars and John .
Could you give me a year ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be interested in Boston .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying right now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve not loved anyone as much as I used to .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This is the last plane I bought yesterday .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please often want to go inside this alone .
This must be as if a problem .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom out of beer .
I guess you won &apos;t be eating with us .
The fire is out .
I can &apos;t walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got Tom .
Tom , where are your apples ?
She advised him if he should pass .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more like you .
It is difficult to understand this novel .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have both to do .
How &apos;s your watch going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take place next Sunday .
Tom can &apos;t handle this job on his own .
Tom had a chance to see Mary .
We just want to know where Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a great without .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be on any questions .
Come back in .
This table is no longer as that one .
&quot; Whose place is this ? &quot; &quot; I have to . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now now .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same mistakes as you had .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a few hours .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the movies when you have a moment ?
Tom &apos;s girls aren &apos;t yours .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone help me ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in the room and then in the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me my passport , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been in speaking with what had happened with him .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought Mary might want to walk to Boston with Mary .
Tom said he thought Mary really needed to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read a book ?
I can &apos;t see someone you don &apos;t want to .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said , &quot; Let &apos;s leave tomorrow . &quot;
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There may be some more way .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in his life .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who speaks French with me .
I can &apos;t see you in trouble .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a car .
This dress is much too large for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anymore .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to eat for his children .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know about your help .
I thought I wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well with my sister .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s hard to get out of here .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive next .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a good idea .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father often takes a cup of coffee every morning .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time you want to talk with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom hurt ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only has everything .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I &apos;ve got many more .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is hard to Tom .
How was the weather ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the news and asked the question .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what he is wrong in English .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Let of sit after these people , please .
Tom is trying not to get out about it .
I brought my glasses for you .
Tom seems injured .
Tom has always been sick .
Tom had away with his mind .
Did you put Tom up to it ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The letter is too expensive .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept tomorrow .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why this is possible .
You can read , but I can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one who wrote this letter .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary went .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the place .
Tom hasn &apos;t been afraid of those .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that but wait very well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the news from here .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the building .
He did nothing I have in the garden all day .
Do you know what Tom heard for breakfast ?
Do you want to hold up ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is so beautiful .
The boy I love me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining .
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you already decided ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as far as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at home .
I may not do that &apos;s .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any brothers .
He asked me whether I had slept weather last week .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , too .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar .
Tom needs help .
How when you think Tom is it ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you hadn &apos;t seen Tom somewhere before .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak English or not .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been in trouble in .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to buy anything .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your old are over .
I think I should know .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick in Boston for a week .
I want to talk to him about him .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I care about is the truth .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like summer the best .
When I came home , he was watching .
The sky &apos;s very sad .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That love us well .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you were all with all .
My mother could speak five languages .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s eyes .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says he doesn &apos;t understand .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always had this problem .
It will not last for three minutes .
What color is Tom do ?
It was a beautiful time .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a car .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for your mother to read .
Tom lost his company in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have children ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked .
You were busy .
I like both cats and mine .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not possible anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in this station .
I &apos;m only going to say it for you .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our homework .
I &apos;ve been to Boston often enough .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how lucky it is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother hiding from the station .
What much flowers are you ?
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not to me .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am not the person you .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what it happened .
We &apos;re not always .
When you go to school , you &apos;ll understand .
What day is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I say .
You should eat lunch .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to make me everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you a chance .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life or death .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What time are the kids ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you for a favor of you ?
Is this true ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw Tom three times a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to have to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary , but he loves .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you &apos;re hungry , you can speak English .
There is a cat on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you just give Tom .
Tom would do everything what happened in the matter .
We don &apos;t expect anything anymore .
You were beginning of you , Tom .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of food do you like ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom came to open .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever seen writing a letter in French ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that far .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s next year .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can &apos;t find time about that .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all you are doing here ?
How far is it from here to here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as cold as it else .
Do you have any idea ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the beginning we happened .
Tom , Mary and Alice were all in Boston together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do no idea .
Tom asked Mary what kind of Japan she had .
He kept me waiting for my advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the last time Tom could do .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea looks like a good story .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I &apos;ve finished that .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time Tom got married ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very small .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you want something to eat ?
No one is running .
I &apos;m going to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that doesn &apos;t make Tom .
English is not living in the party .
My father loves coffee .
Is there anything we can do ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents are love .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the kind of success .
Tom will take care of everything .
To believe that &apos;s what I should do .
How come you got there ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my mother .
I &apos;d have let you &apos;ve asked me .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the man I want to marry .
Tom and Mary almost sing together .
You &apos;re the first age .
It &apos;s impossible for me .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun of sleep .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had already waiting .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a fine job .
Tom has time .
It &apos;s not exactly what Tom wants to say about Mary .
I have no one to turn to for advice .
Who said you stole the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Tom killed barely disappointed .
How could you write me ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three children you read .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk out like a friend of mine .
This man is very different .
That girl can &apos;t take a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that you had met her .
He knew it all along .
The tall man came out of the house .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a tie of a car .
This book is easy enough for them to read .
I don &apos;t know what Tom had .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This window &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better give a job .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very funny .
Tom is kind tired .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and put some mistakes .
These aren &apos;t all you .
I tried again right and what it is .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books to read .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even remember why you &apos;re looking at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s better at all the time .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard in each other .
I told you you to help me with this .
You &apos;re upset at the office at 2 : 30 .
Where is the eyes ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take you with it ?
I invited him food .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been born here .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If it could help us , it &apos;s important .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t know Tom .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How you forget they are ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her eyes .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t find a chance to write a letter .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now on your way .
I usually get home just before 2 : 30 .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to stay for the test .
Tom is a friend out of Tom &apos;s .
Tom spoke into French .
I thought you &apos;d been .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to cook about the teacher .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy you need .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The sun is very small .
My parents isn &apos;t much .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t very tall .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been married three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What is as we are ?
It would take care of you .
Don &apos;t let me know .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I thought .
Our team were playing there .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a decision yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her age .
I think it &apos;s going to do that on time .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my sleep .
