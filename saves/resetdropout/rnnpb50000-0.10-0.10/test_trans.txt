Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
It &apos;s not a real decision .
I can &apos;t think of that I &apos;d like more .
I think it &apos;s better not to do it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve got Tom , but I can &apos;t afford it .
Is he going to make it ?
That was what really mean .
Tom and Mary both know what to do .
The story is very easy to me .
I found it to be careful .
It &apos;s quite impossible when you know the future .
I think you know your face .
Tom told me Mary died on Monday .
They are proud of both .
It looks like you to travel there again .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this morning .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call one while I was out ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t very hungry .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats under the bed .
He will arrive in bed tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you had come with me .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here from school .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the opinion with that to you .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m hard to lose .
I know Tom doesn &apos;t want Mary .
The party was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married for Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for me .
Tom sat at front of his parents &apos; other days .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my parents and sisters .
Today I &apos;m better .
If it sounds like the news .
I see your children in Boston .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The uncle has a dog yet .
I think they look out .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to speak French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused earlier .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing great .
Are you Canadian ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting in the kitchen on the wall .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows anything about it .
Could you give me a glass ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That &apos;s only three o &apos;clock .
Tom smiled at us .
You read too much .
All of those books are white .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there for you .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat lunch .
What are you going as long ?
There &apos;s very little time .
Are we going to eat anything ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill , but he &apos;s now .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be with you ?
Tom likes tea , ice today .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now over to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your opinion .
Tom and Mary talked about it together .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always possible ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog was broken .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Could I have to work this weekend ?
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the box .
He could not seem like talking about .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake twice .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may hurry here .
Tom must be at his side .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did he buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t go so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to Boston for us .
No one believed his question .
I &apos;m learning from sure in this .
I bought a camera one time .
That &apos;s another story .
I know your father .
I like driving by beer .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming this this year .
Tell Tom he is to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him with him .
I think Tom will become famous .
You were with Tom , so much .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I had no problems when I was born .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When did you come to school ?
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What &apos;s the name do ?
When should I &apos;ve been here ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m got to the beach today .
Do you really want to stay here ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom .
Tom used to do that .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s up with you ?
I am too busy , too .
Tom and Mary live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read this , can you ?
It looked not like enough , but she didn &apos;t like her .
I &apos;d like money .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in the kitchen by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You might really look , too .
Tom can do it .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is the last day .
Why are you so busy in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you sure that Tom doesn &apos;t like French at all ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How does your work do ?
I don &apos;t care what you think .
Tom didn &apos;t know that girl at TV .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was going to take this town , so she ?
We &apos;ll go back later .
Why do I need to get married ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big park .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
He comes home .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very calm by the floor .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you please say a story ?
I know .
Those are up , aren &apos;t Tom ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What kind of person is not true ?
I &apos;m not sure if I have this time for you .
My father gave me the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed at that .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed his father .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary were both brothers .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many people are you ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about you .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known that , you &apos;ll do that .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that box .
That was really easy .
A car is in danger .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in bed later than usual .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
In the bridge !
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody else in her .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called her .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom buy with us ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be around a bit longer .
I play the guitar after him .
The message was Tom &apos;s friend .
I asked him if he would come .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t you know where they are going ?
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
Mary killed himself .
Give us some money .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom for ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The concert is filled with us .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll go for you .
The problem is warm .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
I let you &apos;ve forgotten .
She gets up .
I &apos;m impressed by how well happened .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really worried about me .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter to ever arrived up .
Tom wanted to buy a camera .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this coming from Tom ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak French really only night .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom .
You can ask you anything .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost alone .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can use your own .
He was so alive .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them all .
Tom hates you .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s done .
I didn &apos;t put up when it was up .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you solve my umbrella ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This plane has changed a lot .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not as pretty happy here , is it ?
He took back what he was told .
I don &apos;t like this camera to drink .
She helped the old man across the street .
I only have two children .
My friend &apos;s almost as tall as I am .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave this alone .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he had to stay in Boston .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the reason why she was in Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who know him they called .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no dog in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take early .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was to blame .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no use on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
What did you eat for lunch ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had no money .
How did he kill Monday ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that your dog &apos;s ?
It &apos;s what you say it again .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your home ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll phone myself .
How could say that ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the doctor ?
You aren &apos;t like the other kids .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave as soon as I hurry .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry , Tom I don &apos;t have it .
They enjoy one apple .
The baby was bad from warm .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You kids are Tom .
Tom is talking in his life .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like you at playing tennis .
I wonder if I should spend lunch .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very cold .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the last train .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you not doing ?
Tom asked Mary if she was happy in Boston .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are against me around .
I know it &apos;s crazy .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You said I was married .
Will it be raining again ?
Please don &apos;t tell me what to do with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog became cold .
Are you two teeth ?
Tom knows why Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I said .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we sit down after work ?
Tom hasn &apos;t arrive yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happened to Tom &apos;s secret ?
Tom is good at speaking .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should go .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked off .
The boy stopped suddenly .
Tom got to work very far .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What did I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as rich as he think he is .
If you &apos;d told me about it , you &apos;ll &apos;ve done it .
Tom said that he would never see that .
We &apos;ve been afraid of time sooner or not .
Tell me a thing .
We do what we have to do .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve ever heard .
How did you come up with him ?
Where do you know from from ?
I wasn &apos;t very happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forget Tom &apos;s feelings .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do that .
We have you very happy .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly ever stand it .
Tom said he would do something else we can .
The little girl needs more .
You gave Tom the last train I asked for .
Don &apos;t let me do this .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s what Tom does .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t made Tom do that .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his eyes and opened the piano .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you sure about what happened ?
They all look as the same story .
She did come for us .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s impossible .
I didn &apos;t drink that beer .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this noise ?
We were studying French .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can &apos;t understand this .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll do that again .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This happens .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand those .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying I hurt .
I just wanted to say that .
We have a big dog .
How &apos;s you right ?
He spent Mary at least in the garden .
He will soon be a father .
Tom showed Mary a chance .
This is a very beautiful tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw us , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all agree about us .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the address by time .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good opinion to explain it .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is your job , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take me for a swim .
I will take you for a second .
What a nice dog !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do think Tom is .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here after six .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d know in what I said .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly up from me .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you are .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost to sell us .
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that don &apos;t like me .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I have long .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to believe this .
I &apos;d love to sleep for you .
I don &apos;t want to go to you .
I am ready .
I have from my suitcase .
Who will take you there ?
How was Tom doing ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished off this book .
He &apos;s just exactly died .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase tomorrow .
I came here to see what you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a lot of new .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you the whole truth .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom better than Mary ?
I &apos;m nervous on the baby .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work here .
Your French look pretty .
Tom sat and only reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can &apos;t it tell me ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how to do that .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to rain tomorrow .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times did Tom be here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t like me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you wouldn &apos;t like Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that picture ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get working .
She doesn &apos;t live there any longer .
It would be great if you could eat .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as well as I do .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you &apos;d see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many beautiful has bought me ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How about you doing this ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t look like a , very interesting .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I prefer to never leave it .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl came out .
Put out it .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come back .
Is there what you &apos;d like to tell you ?
I wish I was dead .
Can you please tell me where Tom is ?
I don &apos;t think we need anything .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the job .
It was just a problem of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t know us about that .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like .
I don &apos;t drive too early .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t now see Tom again .
Who happened about you ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy her dog .
How do you know I &apos;m not ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the home .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have stayed through this .
What makes you so sure if Tom was a bit younger ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As all he will come back , let me know .
What does Tom do in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was extremely tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did you tell you about you ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to play golf .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When was the fish ?
I think what you need to eat again .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this and Tom ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off .
I have to go alone .
Even that he was ill , but he &apos;s still well .
He did what I wanted .
You have to begin in the city .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually look for Christmas ?
I remember your word .
You promised me you hadn &apos;t done this .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a second .
That as we like .
Tom didn &apos;t ever forget .
We aren &apos;t nothing eat .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play tennis .
I have no idea how to use this morning .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s birthday .
Tom and Mary are crazy .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I told you .
It looks great .
When I came home ?
Tom walked through the window .
Tom was very happy .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that Christmas ?
There isn &apos;t much solution .
I really don &apos;t mean Tom .
He started a new life .
That car is where he lives in the room .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book was very small was days .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both need to go .
Your French is not good .
It isn &apos;t as good as we were rich .
Take a walk on the wall .
I &apos;ve got home with you .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a girlfriend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably right wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much time for me .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your dad OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our first hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was never business for the help .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book began .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a taxi for me for dinner .
I know that you brought us here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve got the last home as I expected you .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch as well .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So we were doing ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the right .
I don &apos;t care what &apos;s on what he said .
It looks like you to make a mistake .
This is not the type of Tom .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a joke .
I want to talk to you on Monday .
I like the way you eat .
What were you doing when I called you ?
Tell us what she is .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for each other .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all wrong .
Do you want me to give you a chance ?
I feel like telling him what I &apos;d be done .
I didn &apos;t stand it .
I was worried of the weather .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a glass of water .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out every Monday .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s not better .
Tom loves his job .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here now .
You have to talk .
We have things to do .
Would you mind play outside ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of the boss .
Tom looked hungry .
Most little fun .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were up all night .
How many times do you hear ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my daughter .
Which is your face ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was in Boston ?
I &apos;ve got a good opinion to don &apos;t want to .
I had fun that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that word by myself .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
I don &apos;t think you should tell you the truth .
A lot of the world has changed .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very careful by the end of the week .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The girl is so expensive .
I read several book last night .
I have a head cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom and Mary who would &apos;ve done that .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed , but no one I like .
I can &apos;t go to the beach with Tom .
Tell Mary to solve the car .
They started studying English .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t kill anyone .
All we like is in my office .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to do .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to stop doing that .
Are you still mad ?
In the students who killed my age is already old .
They arrived over soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t sisters .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a new friend , isn &apos;t he ?
My mother &apos;s coming home early .
Tom keeps on the ball .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom wanted to be .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are you ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that way from the party .
Tom has been in the hospital for three years .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom is busy .
Tom is a very good teacher .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t return yet about me .
I can stay with you .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but she didn &apos;t come .
She was the last girl who did that .
When you know , please ?
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to go swimming today ?
I love it here .
You like that , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone something else in help .
Both his parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the go .
Tom ate the last legs .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your daughter .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to do that all the time .
You said yourself .
I think you &apos;re really interested .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have to take you ?
Tom can &apos;t have until 2 : 30 .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing .
I can &apos;t just let him go .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not go here .
Tom should &apos;ve stayed home with Mary .
Can you please tell me what you live ?
I have no one to see that movie .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something yet .
How did you say ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no other salt in the room .
Tom is away from late .
Tom spoke very well .
My grandmother has never forgotten back .
They were lucky .
My uncle has gone .
My parents aren &apos;t going to visit me .
I do not have the party .
He is up for what &apos;s wrong .
The man stood on that bench is it .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me another coat .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Do you want to go to Boston with us ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom called me how to do that for him .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks completely about thirty .
We can &apos;t just Tom died .
He &apos;s wearing dinner somewhere everybody .
I &apos;m going to go alone .
Today is my books &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to stay ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary again .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving if you tell me .
I love you .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they studying ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s sister &apos;s .
Where &apos;s the dog ?
We can &apos;t have it .
He plans to buy a car .
You &apos;re not here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you weren &apos;t invited us .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear a word .
Tom got really angry .
I have life in my house .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to hurt .
Tom seems angry .
It is his computer .
Tom did it really for fun .
Tom looks living from Boston .
Who wrote ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s all easy to be in bed .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who hit this ?
Tom has everything to do .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this this morning ?
Tom told me that he loved Mary , too .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the watch .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to do this this week .
He knows the room well .
Tom was able to do that by himself .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is isn &apos;t as white as you are .
We don &apos;t care what to do .
I made that .
My father is busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking at his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak English .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m not here .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m sorry for you .
Tom was hot .
I was worried about it .
Tom returned the letter from Mary .
He quit smoking .
Tom is the only one who likes Mary .
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you said by true ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off this morning .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How is it ?
Thanks to both .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to explain it for me .
I never meant to let you around happy .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to do that by himself .
Tom said he wanted to do it on purpose .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing you again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary kissed him .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her name .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose cake is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to let me win .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you want English ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit nervous .
I found the key that Tom was wearing .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
Tom is new from the car .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They should have missed the chance about you .
We are calling the police .
Tom is still young when he will come home .
How much is this building ?
Tom got some trouble .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the song you were very poor .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed all morning .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my daughter .
Where would you like to the party ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re still rich in me .
Tom is going out of the kitchen .
Tom sat across his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son will succeed .
Were you expecting something ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to go back .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary married ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother always comes home last night .
I just wanted to say that for Tom .
Those are my books &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you need it .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let Tom all come .
Tom , exactly I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take for my advice .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have few good friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary &apos;d do that for him .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast enough .
The car is ready .
It all only finished in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is wrong in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost three times of time .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you need me ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom is happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear any questions .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need someone to talk to John .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s definitely need to succeed .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s office in the office ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents you .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without yourself .
Here is my suitcase .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d kept Tom a break .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick with Tom .
Tom heard everybody singing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the sofa .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it on the matter .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to do ?
Is that book ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The train is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my new bike ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father is not tired .
Tom has a lot of work .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these Sunday ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary waiting for Mary .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary wouldn &apos;t be able to help us .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel sad somewhere in Boston .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never Mary &apos;s age .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to work today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone like I like Tom .
Tom loves life .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the first train station .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little younger than you .
I want to apologize .
Please remember me to Boston , please .
It can be as a secret .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want living here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before .
I guess you won &apos;t come anything .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got something .
Tom , where are you ?
She advised him and her friends .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom to work .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom had more more .
It is difficult to understand this voice .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have some friends .
How &apos;s your good plan ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting was out of order .
Tom can &apos;t handle this , is it ?
Tom had a chance to the library .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a television , I &apos;m pretty sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in school .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never told him what happened to Boston .
Come back in .
This table is the same age as you .
&quot; &apos;t leave me on this .
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that car .
Tom never understood .
It &apos;s all evening .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same problems as you .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a few questions .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the beach , Tom ?
Tom &apos;s around funny and he loves him .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that for Tom .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , aren &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something and didn &apos;t come on alone .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not busy at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , aren &apos;t you ?
Bring me today &apos;s paper , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never made anything right today .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he wanted to go to Boston by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read such a letter ?
I can &apos;t see you anymore .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said , &quot; So it &apos;s car .
I understand everything to the meeting .
She wasn &apos;t helping everyone .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There &apos;s nothing else to happen .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that right now .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in his house .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be fired .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me for this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this afternoon .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of my parents .
I &apos;m going to stay here for dinner .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This dress is too much for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
French is pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
I will go abroad next month .
I don &apos;t know what to do exactly for him .
Tom has what he wants .
I want to know more about your problems .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well , but I feel like Tom .
What else do I do to help ?
Tom will come to us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It would be here because you are here .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom wouldn &apos;t let Mary do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to use a car .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What do you think he said ?
This isn &apos;t a place for help .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father showed us to go every Sunday .
Tom speaks French better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk to you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I have to leave on Monday .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only has of her arm .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really thinking about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is to my room .
How was the song ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the phone and train .
I had fun something .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what he wanted to do something in the world .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , that is all possible ?
Tom is trying to be so scared at that .
I brought something I want to tell you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on the mind .
Did you put Tom to it ?
Tom told me that he was innocent .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The water is taking a tree .
I think it &apos;s interesting .
I sat next to Mary .
I slept nine hours .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is here .
You can read , can you ?
I &apos;m the one with my father .
Tom doesn &apos;t know if Mary wanted to do .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the first train .
Tom hasn &apos;t been welcome here .
Tom came to see us .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that yet .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the future .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I say more .
I found the building .
He did nothing but play tennis .
Do you know what Tom look at ?
Do you want to get up over from Tom ?
How long will you be late , please ?
The soup is so hot .
The boy they like me .
How often do you wash your clothes ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my address .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary was very old .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you tell me ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as well as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at reading .
I don &apos;t want to go there either .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to do this .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me if she had paid the last day .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This is coming with us .
Tom likes Mary , but I ?
What &apos;s he going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is innocent .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the piano is my age .
Tom needs help .
How good do you think Tom is happy ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had turned late .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the airport .
I do that every week .
You should not speak French of others .
Tom pretended he had nothing .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in work .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to driving that party .
How am I going to get this ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope this doesn &apos;t belong on it .
I think I should probably go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I look when I is doing it .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I received the problem .
When I came home , he went to Japan .
The sky has changed hope .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother wants me to study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking just night .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That
I found this from me .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you think about it , too .
My mother had changed the accident .
Tom has to go to bed early .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
That sometimes is true .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not not my fault .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to come .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always knew you .
It was better than three minutes .
What color car do you usually do ?
It was a pencil .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s your watch on time .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have missed .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to be something for you .
You were busy .
I love both being from English .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you in Boston .
I &apos;m sorry to have one more time .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to work far away .
I &apos;ve been not a good city .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how from it .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called Tom up outside .
What tall flowers !
I &apos;m afraid of both of you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The boy is over .
I am taking this company .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what this is what you want .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What big is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything I say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any time .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a problem of it &apos;s name .
I don &apos;t think anybody know this name .
What are the children are saying ?
Tom ate food .
Could I talk to you at a second over a second ?
Is this good ?
That doesn &apos;t really rain today , does it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw my teacher yesterday .
Tom came back .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this .
Tom was definitely drunk .
He may be on the stairs .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and Mary are waiting for John in Boston .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot today .
If you are hungry , you care .
There is a chair on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you just asked Tom .
Tom would like nothing more money than anybody .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You could study English at that time .
These are yours , aren &apos;t he ?
What I told anyone never has happened to do .
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hear Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant in Tokyo ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even take that in the world .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to worry .
I can &apos;t find time to do that anymore .
Tom found the camera he had to do .
Tom loved doing that .
What are it all over here ?
How far is it from here to help ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not three o &apos;clock today .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll start .
We helped Tom .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice must get married soon .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do think I should quit .
Tom asked Mary what he said .
He brought no attention to her face .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was only a good thing .
We had fun for them .
Can I try this again ?
I was worried about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your book ?
Your idea is quite good .
I &apos;ve been waiting for something .
Do you have what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what Tom wanted .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk , please .
Can you remember the students stand together ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very healthy .
You do want , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something else you want to say ?
No one is impossible .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a large piece of wine .
Mary did not to come at the beach .
My car loves milk .
Is there anything you can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents are hungry .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the best way to live .
Tom will take care of everything .
Wait sure we could say such to help me .
How come I haven &apos;t seen you lunch ?
Is it Tom &apos;s idea ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom never was my only one .
I know you &apos;d like Tom .
I can &apos;t help you now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told me why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the girl so sorry I &apos;ll you .
Tom and Mary often fight together .
You &apos;re the only woman I &apos;ve ever live .
It &apos;s making us .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s so fun .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was just married .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that today .
I can &apos;t visit you every morning .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It wasn &apos;t true .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not not good at me .
I have no one to blame for .
Who told you his mother ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to be fine .
&quot;
How fast was my bag ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the office , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to know anything about you , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to make a new computer .
This boy is very , very large .
That girl love you .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on my desk .
He said that that wasn &apos;t busy .
He knew it all along .
The tall man went out .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a good look to work .
This book is easy enough for children to stay .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to music .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This dog &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better not take a break .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s new at school .
Tom is kind to make up here .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here so far ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be difficult .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom will put up outside when he left .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried everything and then &apos;s safe .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has happened to her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know how to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know what you want .
It &apos;s not what we want to tell .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s older than you sometimes .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t eaten any more friends .
I told you this question .
You &apos;re supposed to Boston at the office .
Where is the face ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s problems again .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I knew I &apos;d be Canadian .
What time do you usually leave ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see that again .
If that guitar , I &apos;d help .
To tell you the truth , don &apos;t you ?
Tom looks like he &apos;s happy .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the case to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get up .
I don &apos;t have an dog in this building .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
Make pretty important .
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Give me her dress .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on his clothes .
You don &apos;t tell a lie .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home right away .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to hurry .
Tom is a friend of my birthday .
Tom speaks only French .
I thought you &apos;d like .
I know a lot about it .
I barely know how to play the guitar .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how old you have to be .
You can believe you .
Tom said that he heard Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already need to hurry .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why .
The building is very heavy .
My situation is quite bad .
How will you find this ?
Go take there .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good good for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough children .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I was said .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s OK .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He came for work .
She &apos;s already way for me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been wait three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What do you think who Tom was ?
It &apos;s almost waiting for three hours .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find the office .
Thanks for all that .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re OK .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Our baby stopped crying .
That &apos;s my friends .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher &apos;s young , but she is rich .
I think it &apos;s time for me to the station .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the park .
I take my new dictionary .
