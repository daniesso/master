Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to do now .
I can &apos;t remember in that of you .
I think it &apos;s time to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked all three months .
Is he going to make it ?
That began !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is from me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy that you know .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary &apos;s on Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you need to sleep this once .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do Tom if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two kids sleeping .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you could come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the same car because to Tom .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t talk .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom spent as strong on the piano .
It started raining raining .
I love my brothers and death .
Today , I have a lot of money .
If that makes me , I &apos;m very smart .
I see your cat in the park .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your friend .
Tom looked angry .
The room won &apos;t open today .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his help .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to become with her .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the bench .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom wants to make that that .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her seat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary and laughed at home .
You read too much .
All of them swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary wasn &apos;t busy .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a message here that you don &apos;t know .
Tom took his life .
I usually eat less than my sister .
What are you going to get ?
There &apos;s very little English left .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was too old , but he &apos;s .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea coffee coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your favor .
Tom and Mary played together almost every day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it still cold here ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog is a policeman .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us are not to school this evening .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand so much .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the way .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like it .
Tom came to my office to ask me for money .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much about that .
I bought a long time ago .
That &apos;s another problem .
I know your father .
I like studying late after school .
He is liked by everybody .
I have few questions to weekend .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s mom .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never become sick .
You were with Tom yesterday , didn &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was there to meet her house .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you ever want to go to church , Tom ?
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said too far .
When should I still tell the others ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also tired .
Do you really want to stay here for a minute ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom very happy .
Tom used to do that .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s up there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his friends live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , do you ?
It looked like you wanted to tell her , but I didn &apos;t show him .
I &apos;d like him for you .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That is impossible enough .
You &apos;re really pretty , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven over here .
Why are you speaking French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you guys worried about Tom ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How long is Tom going to stay ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that easy .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a lot of then , isn &apos;t it ?
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to hear Tom ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big park .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the station this morning .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been too small to me .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very very far into a soup .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put our in a box ?
I know .
Those are from the house , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What makes you not doing ?
I &apos;m not sure if I like this book at that time .
My father had the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that movie .
Let &apos;s go out .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t surprised he will get this soon .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known that , you have known .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was that thing .
A car is five minutes .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat has seven minutes .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who wants to leave .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t love to go there anymore .
He called me every day .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How deep is Tom ?
Give us another few minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The park was filled with us .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading the book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is take home for ten .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need coffee anymore .
I let the cat into my pocket .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m hungry but you speak French .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m pretty sure that she can &apos;t come to the party .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a son who is sick .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t like to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak pretty well .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you &apos;re fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything you want .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t look like Mary do that .
You speak French very well if I could speak it .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you more night .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you do my ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This morning has been sick for a long time .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not going out in this room .
He took back what he wanted .
I don &apos;t like this hat .
She helped the old man across the street .
I only have two children .
If it is all I &apos;d give it at a desk .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new camera .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he takes to get some pictures .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way why me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those men know him speak French .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is nobody in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could be friends .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you study , or ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it all the time that he had to do this .
How was !
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that reading ?
It &apos;s important that you wouldn &apos;t tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the knife ?
You aren &apos;t like the child .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave as soon as possible .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll take the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I don &apos;t have the dog with me .
They know about another house .
The baby hit to open the door behind .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You are not very good .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should write his letter .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you all crazy ?
Tom asked Mary if I was with with her new computer .
I wonder why he is closed .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are afraid to do something .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom won &apos;t help you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be quiet again ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two alone ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French ?
Why don &apos;t we sit down and tell you again ?
Tom returned next morning .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me is important ?
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s office .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as he think he is .
If you &apos;d be here at that , I would &apos;ve let it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t want to do that .
We &apos;ve been asked to stay home .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting down on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve .
How did you come here ?
Where do I know I called you ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never gone to Boston .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said he &apos;s better at doing stuff .
The little girl did nothing else .
You gave Tom the money problem and ask for everything .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his suitcase .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you looking for me ?
They all look the same .
She did if I was young .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s lucky .
I didn &apos;t drink that word .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why you didn &apos;t want to .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;m going to visit Tom again .
Tom could do it if he needs .
This happens is now .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand myself .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m beginning to do that .
I just wanted to say my own .
We have a big dog .
How was work on tomorrow ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary to the beach .
This is a very tall clock .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I go .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all Alice .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret again .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a feeling to read the car .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is supposed to rain today .
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a while .
I will take you for a swim .
What a beautiful desk !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the house .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would you do that ?
I don &apos;t think we should go to Boston .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing soccer .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing in that 2 : 30 .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s nothing more to eat .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you have to do this .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my sister .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to know this time .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to take you .
I am ready .
I have one I need to write .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave there .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just alive .
I can &apos;t take this morning .
I came here to see .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom and Mary ?
I &apos;m told that Tom will win to Mary .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children are running .
Tom sat under a tree and reading .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can you do anything ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how Tom &apos;s father &apos;s .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been there ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that part ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the sofa .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I need .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you want .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not late .
How many flowers did you say ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get rich , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to be there on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom already .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you see me ?
I don &apos;t think that we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised to do the question .
It was just a matter of hours .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear anything for me .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I &apos;ve already won &apos;t see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to eat .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to drive to drive to my house .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in through last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you here to go ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As I grow up and he asked me to open .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
His sister gets out of the room .
I think that you need something to eat .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this chair ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
I play tennis every Sunday .
He did what he wanted inside Boston .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually eat for a minute ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you would call care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a long time .
That who knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t given lunch .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not have to eat lunch last night .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary agree to Mary .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything else .
It looks great .
When I came home , I could sleep .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that ?
There isn &apos;t much who have the world .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new job .
Tom met about the book .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary &apos;d never been to Boston in Boston .
The book was very interesting now .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both need more .
Your French is better .
It isn &apos;t as I thought he was late .
Take the dog for a walk .
I &apos;ve got to go today .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably wrong with it .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve go out of the work .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family alone ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was warm all that there that I am there .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book is delicious .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to finish this .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom who .
I &apos;ve just lost both on TV .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t remember fish when I was a child .
I do not like this .
So where will you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s right or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what you think .
It looks good to show it .
This is all the very good time as I have .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about .
I like the way you bought .
What were you doing when I called you today ?
Are you a doctor now ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right .
Do you want me to give you a piece of paper ?
I feel like writing what I think of her .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the meeting .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out very well .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s even we can .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here here .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do that .
Would you like that bird ?
I think that Tom doesn &apos;t speak French anymore .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of fat .
Tom looked great .
Most people think is &apos;ll live .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were up all night .
How many times do you like this ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your sister ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get to get married ?
I &apos;ve got a very good idea .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report by tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people are used in the future .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be too hard to buy the week .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant was worth cars .
I read several books last week .
I have a head cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom and Mary to get it .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the university with this .
&quot; What are she on on , Tom ?
They looked angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be happy .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is watching TV .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that matter .
Are you still mad ?
Tom took his son .
They arrived too hard .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t completely alone .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is very a student , but Mary &apos;s not old .
My mother and mother aren &apos;t at home now .
Tom keeps on the kitchen .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom said .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that expensive .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom loves Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t remember anybody was there .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but she didn &apos;t drive .
She was the first girl I &apos;d ever seen .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never heard something like that .
Both she did his parents .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the go .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I known you ?
Tom can play in the kitchen .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in himself friends .
I can &apos;t remember what I did .
The door was closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you saw Tom ?
Please do not drink so much .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary help her homework .
Can you show me where you live on this house ?
I have not have a friend like that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come you didn &apos;t show up ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat doesn &apos;t come back .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do you have to lend me my car .
He hasn &apos;t done what he was right .
The fire came on Tom &apos;s head .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry the map .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
Do you think Tom &apos;ll want to see what to do with this ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom called Mary some water to do that to do .
I don &apos;t know where my watch .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t stand it leg .
He &apos;s wearing glasses seriously seriously .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my only one &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary over there .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me .
I love you mad .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the good girl ?
We can &apos;t have you all scared .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new at school , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this song very seriously .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to help Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It is their last day .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary will spend their weekend next year .
Who came ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the best movie of Tom can .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this coffee ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for me .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this week ?
Tom told me that he might be interested in doing that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was by impressed by Mary would be late .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is worth reading again and immediately .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can you ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m like .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have seen him .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the shirt into my pocket .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever going to get it ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it ?
You could have done it .
Whose first was this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a friend of Christmas .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How is better for me ?
Thanks for books .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to help me for me .
I never started to be up at all noise .
I didn &apos;t drink bread yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to me kids .
Tom said he decided it to be on it .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you anything .

Why do you have books ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit tired .
I found the money that Tom had lost .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
Tom is new with me .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be from Tom , Tom ?
They will have become a man who you there .

How much is this worth ?
Tom visited us three months .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the last man you were very well .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week now .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son &apos;s very good for me .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary known each other ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother doesn &apos;t like me to go home .
I just wanted to show you something for me .
Those are my sister &apos;s one .
I &apos;m glad you are here .
I &apos;m proud to be here .
Let them all do that .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one one .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk outside .
I have tea with me .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all came in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is spoken in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost as old as we can .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to be like ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How many cars !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s all tie at the airport ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d listened to my joke .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard you wait .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who speak French .
I spoke to him with the movie .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man over ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The night is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you feed my car ?
I looked at Tom .
Do you like school ?

Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like very much .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to drink too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to get today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never heard much as much as I love Tom .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This is the one who was born in this town .
I knew this was to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little French .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come and visit us tomorrow .
It can be finished yet .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk .
I guess you won &apos;t win .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much .
Tom , where are we ?
She advised him where he had to stay .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time to swim .
What is it that you want me to do today ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re better .
I wish Tom were young .
It is difficult to fix this house .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I both are talking to each other .
How &apos;s your job to go ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take place every day .
Tom can &apos;t handle this job on his own .
Tom had a chance to live .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll make a look around where I &apos;m broke .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in Australia .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never enjoyed to take this light .
Come back in .
This table is the same color .
&quot; Whose keys to Tom ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m Mary &apos;s . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t have money .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now or not .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same idea as you had .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a good time .
Tom entered in the room .
Could you come to your office for a minute ?
Tom &apos;s dog does not fit .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in French and then lives in the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know .
Bring me these books , please .
What &apos;ve you wrote ?
I &apos;ve never been eaten but it , but it .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home by bus .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you guys read ?
I can &apos;t tell anyone about you .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said that &apos;s OK .
I understand music a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There may be true again again .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without Mary .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Sunday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who wants this .
I can &apos;t see you somewhere in your office .
I &apos;m going to stay here for Tom .
Tom can &apos;t afford to see a house .
This dress is a good good for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night .
What else can you do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s very mad with you .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was shy .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a place for six .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
Get out .
My father speaks too much coffee .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time for you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a doctor ?
Tom only has as many as before .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were both friends .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the break near the break .
I had fun tonight .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what Mary would &apos;ve done in the situation .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , may turn children , do you ?
Tom is trying to be back in us .
I brought something to keep working .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put Tom up to Mary ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The bread is still warm .
I think you &apos;ll be interested .
I sat next to him .
I slept off you .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be true .
Tom hasn &apos;t seem lost .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom very well yet .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see me .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the village .
He did nothing but every work .
Do you know what Tom was in Australia ?
Do you want to be found a break ?
How long will you be doing this ?
The soup is too hot to swim .
The book I love love ?
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother to say .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he won &apos;t do it again .
Have you almost read this ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about about .
I don &apos;t want to go home .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no friend to help you with my homework .
Perhaps you &apos;d stop .
I don &apos;t have any of .
He asked me whether I had slept well last night .
Isn &apos;t Tom awake ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , but Mary .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is very old , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The cat playing the piano is my son .
Tom needs help now .
How much is Tom ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I don &apos;t want to see tomorrow .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not make many books easily easily .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been there in weeks .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t want to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope you you bad bad .
I think I should go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him to talk to him .

I like those the way .

He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That won &apos;t be late .
I found this movie by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you all at all happy .
My mother can &apos;t know how .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes does really well .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we want to do .
I wondered if this would happen this .
It will never last more than three minutes .
What color does you drink ?
It was a different time .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The cake needs to be a doctor .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for you .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have a job .
Do they have to help us ?
Tom is asked me for me .
You were busy .
I like both of cats .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston with us .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom says his stuff .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in this town .
I &apos;m glad to have it one more time .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our homework .
I &apos;ve been to Boston late .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how to read it .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called Tom just give up .
What pretty eyes !
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave now ?
The game is over .
I am taking this next year .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what we are Tom as I do .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you know Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What train today is this ?
Tom gave me some advice .
He believes everything about that .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so many people together .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a lot of fun .
I don &apos;t think anybody would understand me anymore .
What are they doing ?
Tom ate nothing .
Could you talk to your office in a office ?
Is this your father ?
That doesn &apos;t matter all coffee , please .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her a teacher .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot today .
If you are people , we can go now .
There is a cat on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you and Tom know Tom .
Tom would like nothing more than to tell Mary .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had run early .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of soup do you like ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you old ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a tie alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even know that very well .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find any money to do that .
Tom found the key he wanted to be done .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all these people here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as simple as me this .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll move .
We helped Tom probably the right .
Tom , Mary , John and John live together together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do a pretty good job .
Tom asked Mary what kind of Mary did .
He can &apos;t stay a little .
Tom has more money than Mary does .
That was the only thing Tom can do .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will stop me .
He came back soon .
May I use your eyes ?
Your might be a long time .
I &apos;ve been doing that for three hours .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what Tom told me , but it isn &apos;t .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the movie about the meeting ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very calm .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to me ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going over to be here .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that can &apos;t run .
Germany was what they want to know .
My cat is ill .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who I want to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every bicycle is that that .
How come is too late ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my first friend .
I &apos;d have someone if I have enough .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the accident .
Have you told Tom about you ?
I found the man I want to buy .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
You &apos;re the woman .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s already dark here .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had already gotten married .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t help you later .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like fun .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s Tom and not always have a experience .
I have no one to turn to over to .
Who said that ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; one helped Tom ? &quot; &quot; I met Mary in Boston . &quot;
How fast were you driving ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know when he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to see Mary .
I tried to sleep in a sleep .
This man is very old , isn &apos;t it .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the window .
Do you know about this ?
How many kids are there ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he knew him that .
He knew it all along .
The tall isn &apos;t alone in the room .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want to go to the city .
This book is easy for children to read .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This wouldn &apos;t me me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy at me .
Tom is not kind enough .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and began to write .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried was drunk , too .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of them to my cat .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you want to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s place is almost full here .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard each other in a long time .
I told you Tom would win .
You &apos;re quite sure here .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom that Mary study ill .
I was born .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been gone away .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary here ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If it will help us , it &apos;s Tom .
To tell me I &apos;m leaving today .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see you ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have time for this .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How advice are they ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go crazy .
Her son has been stolen yesterday .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t stand a single name .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home just every moment .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on it .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the exam .
Tom is a friend of my father .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to speak one of the book .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how difficult you &apos;ve been .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The party is too much fast .
My train is great .
How will I find it ?
Go out and sleep .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid Tom to wait for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom asked us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What time is !
It would take three hours to do that .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Our team went married .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher died three years for an hour .
I think it &apos;s time for me to call it a day .
I &apos;d like to have a little more .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I accept my mouth clean .
