Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do .
I can &apos;t think of anybody &apos;s address .
I think it &apos;s better way to make it .
This isn &apos;t difficult .
I &apos;ve arrived all day , but I can &apos;t tell me .
Is he going to make it ?
That beer !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to use .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me another friend .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you &apos;re hungry .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom mind while I was out ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know .
There are sugar and I told him .
He will arrive smoking tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you could come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink of us ?
I have the map for some .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Boston ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than I think .
I know Tom does that and Mary .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say something ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any money on it .
Tom sat enough time to open .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my brothers and John .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If this happens , I &apos;ll be very good .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so sure ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman doesn &apos;t work the time .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his advice .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have no done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom aren &apos;t here anymore .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her son .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about once .
Tom smiled at Mary , didn &apos;t he ?
You read too much .
All dogs can count very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there .
Tom took his own life .
I usually read books .
What are you going now ?
There &apos;s very little two books .
Are we going to eat tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re the one .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea and does .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to know your name .
Tom and Mary often hit each other now .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always cold ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I wants to do .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog is married to them .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to travel abroad .
I have no choice but not like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He would not make being so nervous .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your bag .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me to wait ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my office to help me .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m so afraid of you .
I bought a camera two days ago .
That &apos;s a piece of hope .
I know your father .
I like studying French today .
He is liked by everybody .
I have no problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s dad .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to go .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will become famous .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was able to find the house , but I forgot it .
How are you doing ?
I know this is interesting .
How long are you going to do that ?
I am leaving at ten .
What he said was true .
When should I become in the United States ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m taking this bus .
Do you really want to go to the station ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary left .
We almost knew Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looks like Tom has to say three times .
I &apos;d do go for it .
You should have done .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a small house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really pretty , hope .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is our school .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you sure you don &apos;t have the right ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How did your uncle come ?
I don &apos;t care what he lives .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine day of mine .
We &apos;ll come back .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it .
There is a big park .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been your problem .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very proud of her to read .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put these in a break ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say is not always true .
I &apos;m not sure whether I go or not .
My father had me there .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed at that .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was quite shy .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary watched the game together every day .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had time that I would have done that .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a big place .
That was really fun .
A car is hard enough .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in Australia last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat has seven from the meeting .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s someone who wants to meet you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called her .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom return with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be OK .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as busy as Tom .
I play the guitar , studying French ?
The baby was quiet all day .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask you everything .
You were worried , didn &apos;t you ?
How long is Tom ?
Give them three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life new ?
The dog is filled with ice .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The way is heavy at nine .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
I have the idea to show you .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m not telling that my really cute .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a bit to Australia .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does you like to do that you don &apos;t like to do that ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak one English , but I can &apos;t hear her .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything you don &apos;t like them .
Tom noticed Mary was sick .
What do they look ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get to the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that piece ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your decision .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once .
Did Tom say why Mary said that ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in .
I didn &apos;t arrive till it was ready .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This entered the cat .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really good at your help , are you ?
He took back what he had said of her .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the old man across the street .
I only have two books .
If we &apos;re not a child , I &apos;ll tell it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like that .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he wanted to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for hours .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with .
I don &apos;t like the way Tom left .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who know him speak English .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no clock in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take calm .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s teacher .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one to live in the park .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you care , fish ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it that he had nothing to do with the matter .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me alone .
What &apos;s that your name ?
It &apos;s important that you &apos;re OK .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your night ?
I &apos;d like to call Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll write myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the car ?
You aren &apos;t like the other .
Tom hardly ate when he came .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I do I study very much beer .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems tired .
I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t have my work .
They enjoy another large one .
The baby called to be fast .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You made Tom do .
Tom is talking in music .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like my students .
I wonder if my name is too .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the window .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your job ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you life ?
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are fun to be around .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves me .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be ready again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what happened .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t they use playing these mind ?
Tom hasn &apos;t yet yet .
What &apos;re you saying what Tom said ?
What &apos;s to me ?
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with your family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy is married .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do ?
Tom isn &apos;t as good as how he is .
If I &apos;d ask me to say that I &apos;d &apos;ve done it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been asked to do this anymore .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a date .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I told .
How did you come in such a good idea ?
Where do I know you ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s feelings .
You can &apos;t let Tom die .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else to do .
The little boy did her homework .
You gave Tom the money he asked for to do that .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it .
She met him by Sunday .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a drive .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came along .
Tom closed his eyes and closed .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you seeing me for something ?
They all look the same man .
She will come by a week .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
We were studying tonight .
Tom helped Mary in the bank .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why you don &apos;t want to eat here .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is interesting .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never study French .
Tom could do it if he needs .
This one are we .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never do !
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying what I mean .
I just wanted to say but it .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a dog .
Tom showed Mary the way .
This is a very small day .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s doing for dinner ?
You &apos;re at time .
Tom , Mary Mary still met John .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the right way !
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good lawyer .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is our fault , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do that right now .
Take Tom for a month .
I will take you for a swim .
What a nice idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s hand ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs playing the guitar .
Tom told Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do not like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that ever again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here next month .
I don &apos;t know what I did .
It won &apos;t be here .
There &apos;s hardly tea left to eat .
I thought you found this job .
No one do what you have to do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three days ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been told a lot about help .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to remember this moment .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you . I want to do it .
I am ready .
I have sugar .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will stay the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to tell Tom .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who was tired , Tom wasn &apos;t invited ?
I &apos;m sure that Tom is on golf .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children must be alive .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can &apos;t anything do you done ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s like .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to do that .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times a lot Tom ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t have me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like them .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that chair ?
They don &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great to you .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have so much time .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you &apos;re .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How much long did you arrive ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get the job , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that fire .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you , Tom ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy .
Tom needs the money .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the letter .
It was just a matter .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear eggs , so .
Tom can &apos;t be young anymore .
I never felt like you .
I don &apos;t drive so fast .
I always go to school on TV .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t close Tom .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter to me .
Tom loves going to .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy something to happen .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in trouble last year ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the meeting .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked .
What makes you so asking Tom ?
I couldn &apos;t find a book .
It &apos;s not for you .
I just wanted to work .
As soon as he told me to understand me .
What does your family in you ?
I wanted to speak more about this .
Tom seems a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to have married .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no reason .
Don &apos;t forget to give a speech .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he thought he knows , he is studying French .
I think you need now .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little drunk that .
My parents are both late .
What is the difference between this and that ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three cars .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even out of his mind , he doesn &apos;t let he .
He did what I wanted right away .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually want to finish for ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d meet us .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That boy knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give up .
We weren &apos;t come yet .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not to buy everything to eat .
It &apos;s stupid Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary have to be angry .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked .
It looks great .
When I came your friend , I was my girlfriend .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t much difference between the two .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That school is mine .
Tom and Mary have a lot of money .
Tom said he thought Mary &apos;s going to be home .
The friend I wanted to call Tom last week .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have a few friends .
Your French is really hot .
It isn &apos;t as good as we .
Take the dog .
I &apos;ve got Tom to tell Tom .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with my brother .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of those .
There &apos;s no reason to &apos;ve done .
You &apos;re probably doing it up .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got to work at the moment .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your money .
Is your family ?
I &apos;m not afraid .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was too long that I could swim here .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book would be interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be disappointed .
It &apos;ll take a long week for me .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just had a friend he died .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was gone .
I do not like this song .
So age where you do .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what happened .
It looks as if it is going to our party .
This is just Mary &apos;s parents .
What are this plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about .
I like the way you walk .
What were you doing yesterday ?
How do you get into trouble ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all say about OK .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like telling him what I think .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a camera for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats too early every morning .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s not at this .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you like to play tennis with that ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Most things don &apos;t work anymore .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot eat who to go with .
I love cake .
I just gave you your opinion .
How many times do you think you were here ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your book ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get some pictures of the road ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason about Tom .
I had fun that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll always give it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that night .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people were killed .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very careful .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant we started .
I read several books last week .
I have a dog strong .
They know their homework .
I asked Tom to tell Mary why he didn &apos;t like her .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for everything .
I can &apos;t go to the party .
&quot; Please come on time ?
They grew angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to tell you .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is busy .
You don &apos;t need to stop funny .
Are you still mad ?
She was the only one more room than yesterday .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t listening .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very close , but he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
My mother and I sat on one .
Tom loves on TV .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom said it would be .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good is it ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that far from here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three days .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good lawyer .
Tom said that he &apos;d like to be alive .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t return till it was ready .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary for Mary .
She was the first girl I &apos;ve ever been .
When you know , you know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this here ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone anything like that .
Both her parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the bank .
Tom ate the book suddenly .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to losing your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I have to do that ?
Tom can hardly see what Mary was saying .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on with Tom .
Tom needs a lot of children .
I can &apos;t remember what I was trying .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Can you hear where you feed my dog ?
I have not to see her once .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come do you going to school ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than Mary .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is back home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat hasn &apos;t stopped yet .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents don &apos;t work .
I do not have the key to the hotel .
He stood up for what happened .
The man in America is Tom &apos;s .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry the suitcase .
We &apos;re both man .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot;
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were sure they could do .
I don &apos;t know where my dog is too .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just talk to Tom .
He has gone enough enough to wear mine .
I &apos;m not living in Boston .
Today is my little cold .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you think ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary walking and there .
Tom lived in Australia for three years .
I &apos;m not seeing you everything .
I love you at love .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking about it .
Where are they from ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s house .
Where &apos;s the new thing ?
We can &apos;t have you seen Tom .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re welcome to look at me .
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to talk about it .
Tom got really angry .
I feel tired .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to do .
Tom seems angry .
It is their last movie .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom helped Mary three months ago .
Who came ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for care .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he &apos;s tired .
That &apos;s the best friend I should &apos;ve bought it .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this bird ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this kind of bad ?
Tom told me that he thought I was interested in .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the future well .
Tom was advised not to be able to do that by himself .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is worth reading again .
We don &apos;t care what he lives .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , does he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m swimming .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have to make somebody .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the shirt because he was ten years .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told you the way to move ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it says ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off .
Tom said you might come with you .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How far is it ?
Thanks to both of those .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to do that for me .
I can &apos;t mean to put up .
I didn &apos;t know whether I saw him yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to have by sugar .
Tom said he decided to do it .
Can your brother drive ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at Mary .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you her name .
I can &apos;t say who else .
Why do you have one ?
I should be there for my wife .
We were both a bit drunk .
I found the money that she had lost .
Tom is almost six feet shy .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be near me ?
They will have a bit hungry anymore .
We are staying the bus .
Tom is younger at least thirty days .
How much is this worth ?
Tom visited us with his job .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I study the guitar .
I &apos;d like to have another glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for the week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his parents .
That must never happen .
Her son will succeed for a long time .
Were you expecting something to do ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary fight ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother said Tom likes me .
I just wanted to thank you for that .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to do that .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that man there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several eggs .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all happens in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me at days .
What country is Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They have something else .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try it to me .
How fast !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need someone to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are you ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that building of the home ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t know your names .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could do that without your health .
Here is your house .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d known if you might be .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard us laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a lot about you .
I spoke to him about the keys .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The night is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my new car ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father loves him .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these books ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your keys ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would come call me .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying right now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat so much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost a key .
Please be quiet .
We need to work today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved him so much time .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the only time of you seen yesterday .
I knew this was wrong .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please hardly come near here .
It can be just around .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d rather seen Tom drunk .
I guess you won &apos;t be alone with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much longer .
Tom , where are they ?
She advised him if he had no time .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom what he wants .
It &apos;s about you old .
What is it that you want me to do ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more .
It is difficult to understand this novel .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have something to do .
How &apos;s your job like ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take place next year .
Tom can &apos;t wait .
Tom had a time to travel .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a try , but I &apos;m sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to buy anything else .
Come back in .
This car is the same idea of it .
&quot; Whose shirt is this ? &quot; &quot; No , thank you ? &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same choice .
Thanks for me .
I need to ask you for a little French .
Tom entered the kitchen .
Could you ever tell your mother if you don &apos;t know ?
Tom &apos;s strong where he doesn &apos;t live .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did you see Tom ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like to give something to Tom .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would you do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop our rules .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t tell Tom .
Bring me today &apos;s paper .
What &apos;ve you got to do ?
I &apos;ve never been able to do that !
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read a book ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He was at nine nine .
I understand slowly .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do with ?
What do you mean you here ?
There may be the way things happened .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often often ?
Tom goes to church by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking about your mother .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This dress is much enough for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly hates him .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to do him .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like him .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well and night .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s vacation to break here .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary wanted to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a picture of you .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father works in a walk every day .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably alive .
I &apos;d like to have more time .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a movie with Tom ?
Tom only has one leg .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were both worried .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , isn &apos;t it ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the movie ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the phone .
I had fun of this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a girlfriend ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as much as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t as much money .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , not look like it , please .
Tom is nothing just to apologize about what he did .
I brought something that I don &apos;t like to give you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his own .
Did you put it up to Tom ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The check is the summer .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept the bus .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read now , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary saw us .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the one .
Tom hasn &apos;t been afraid of it .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see that .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the house .
He did nothing but watch TV .
Do you know what Tom wrote for that time ?
Do you want to hurry if you like Tom ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is very hot today .
The boy boy loves me .
How often do you come ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It should stop raining .
I don &apos;t want my best to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know Mary a little reason .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it .
Have you as someone else ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about six .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no money to do that .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me whether I had slept well last night .
Isn &apos;t Tom Tom ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary at the weekend .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar is my brother .
Tom needs to help me now .
How far are you ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had asked home .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak ill .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been in trouble .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t like to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your woman was thirty .
I think I should probably go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I care about is the truth .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like it two .
When I came home , he was watching TV .
The beginning has become clear .
This is a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That job is well .
I found this movie by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought that , I think about it .
My mother could do everything the future .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says of it isn &apos;t true .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s five .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to do .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always love to die .
It will nothing more than that .
What color do Tom get to Boston ?
It was a different guy .
He doesn &apos;t know how to do that .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for your father to read .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have time ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked .
You were busy .
I like both dogs don &apos;t agree .
Tom says he &apos;ll go there .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here .
I &apos;m not going to say it one more .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to live in the house .
I &apos;ve been to Boston then .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how to do that .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother up by the train .
What pretty flowers !
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave now ?
The rain is over .
I am taking a car .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what happened to the movies .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see me .
What is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to thank me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a plan , can &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t think anyone can help me anymore .
What are the men doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone with a second ?
Is Tom eating ?
That doesn &apos;t seem milk , does it ?
Everyone kind of success .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your health ?
I saw her three years ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the bank ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you a week .
Tom and I are busy , too much for Mary .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot .
If you are hungry , you can understand the letter .
There is a cat on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom would rather be willing to find that mistake .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had better answer the train .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of books do you like to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone at there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t get so far .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s Monday .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can &apos;t believe Tom to do that .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all Tom doing here ?
How far is it from here ?
He stayed up three days ago .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as busy as Tom was yesterday .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice will all go swimming together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do love my lawyer .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car .
He paid no money to him .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom did .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried about John .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
The world aren &apos;t children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea is a good problem .
I &apos;ve been asking that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you do ?
I want to drink something .
This is a new fish that Tom gave me .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you eat so much time ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very strong .
You do that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something that you want to say ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to be with you .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big start .
I have a dog that strong .
They don &apos;t want to do anything like the future .
My cat loves milk .
Is there anything we can help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents loves you .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the truth , but I want to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
I believe you is wrong .
How could I get you ?
Is it Tom ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom was it was .
I &apos;d have to ask you the reason .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the room was .
Have you told you why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the book .
Tom and Mary understood each other together .
You &apos;re the best man I &apos;ve ever been .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun than him .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had just gotten married .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a good idea .
Tom has left the house .
It &apos;s not just Tom very crazy .
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I was the money ?
They look good .
What is she ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; Will you stay ?
How fast did you go ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to school , too .
Tom has three dogs .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do all for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I forgot to talk a vacation right now .
This man is very very old .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he loved him .
He knew it all along .
The tall man came in the room .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a tie to go with Tom .
This book is easy enough for to read .
I don &apos;t know what Tom could do .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This &apos;s way for me .
I &apos;d better go on a look .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind while I was busy .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m at half .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here so night ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his parents and she loves me .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried again and again .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this time ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know girls .
Now I feel short .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of your books to read .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know how to do this without Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s almost a man that boy .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t seen from John in a long time .
I told you Tom to help us alone .
You &apos;re supposed to do again .
Where is the problem ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s death is an hour .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to me .
I wish I &apos;d been married .
What time do you leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary very happy ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If anybody can help me , it &apos;s a true .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like her .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make here a problem .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get .
I don &apos;t have the right back .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How important are you ?
I &apos;d like to ask you to answer .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her cat is John .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some money .
You never quit smoking before .
English is difficult to get .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home as soon as I saw him .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the book .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to talk to school anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the rules .
Tom is a friend of my car &apos;s .
Tom spoke French .
I thought you &apos;d come .
I know a lot about it .
I only eat a glass of milk on TV .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy you need .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know who I did without you .
What could you say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The world is very tall at all .
My movie is quite long .
How can I find it ?
Go out and salt .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for a job .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way looked after Tom .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been our hands .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What would I thought about the party ?
It would take at you three hours .
Don &apos;t let the cat .
I must be free .
Thanks for all of your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Our team died .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young .
I think it &apos;s a good job .
I &apos;d like to have a little good .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my vacation .
