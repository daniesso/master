Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do .
I can &apos;t think of anything .
I think it &apos;s better way .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I look very great , but I &apos;ve lost the book .
Is he going to make it ?
That hurts !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so simple .
I think you can &apos;t handle it .
Tom told me Mary died last year .
They are proud of mistakes .
It are you I like to meet her .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that anymore .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them what to do .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom still talk to you ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats and the room .
He will keep eating breakfast .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy to do that .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got a job to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the whole name with that .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that anymore .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary as three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom fell in front of Mary .
It worked raining yesterday .
I love my brothers .
Today , I &apos;m not here .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very happy .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman cannot be telling the truth .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem thing I am .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is a very boy in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows about that .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her friend .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That &apos;s best .
Tom smiled at Mary .
You read too much .
All of them play very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem that that &apos;ll see .
Tom took his name .
I usually know a name .
What are you going ?
There is in the bag way .
Are we guys doing this alone ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill , but he &apos;s right .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes me alone .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to decide .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played tennis almost all the first day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is Tom still worried about your homework ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
I didn &apos;t even know how to Tom .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us are children .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand back .
I think Tom &apos;s a lot recently .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your bag .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some coffee ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t read a story .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my office to help Mary .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much for you .
I bought a camera two days ago .
That &apos;s a matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking wine .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to marry him .
I think Tom was born injured .
You were with Tom yesterday .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I told Tom where he was correct .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When did you go to Boston ?
I am leaving !
What he said he was disappointed .
When should Tom hit ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m still proud of you .
Do you really want to stay here for a minute ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came .
We almost must get Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and Mary rarely live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read to Tom , do you ?
It looked like Tom can &apos;t afford to do something about John .
I &apos;d say anything we say .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me do that ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in Australia by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really pretty , are you .
Tom can &apos;t answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of milk .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could help another plane .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very careful .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven o &apos;clock .
Why are you working in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s happening .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying by yourself ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How &apos;s your suitcase standing up ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine tomorrow .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big school .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The phone is now , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been your secret .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s eyes .
Tom got just as many cats .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you please talk , too ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What it does is not true .
I &apos;m not sure I want to do this .
My father had me the same problem .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that Americans .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly confused .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t students together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had no one at that , I &apos;ll be disappointed .
Tom seemed already .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is stolen in the room .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in weeks last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat is five minutes .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who wants to meet you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there .
He called Mary .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring with me ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
What &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby will stop all over .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them when they are going .
You should stay awake now .
How big is Tom ?
Give them three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The game is present on cars .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his mouth .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is nine away .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to be a doctor .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
I let the cat is worried about Tom .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by his place .
I know that Mary loved me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really looking forward to Tom .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter who is ready .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can &apos;t hear him so much to understand her .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look crazy .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can &apos;t ask you what you want .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You think I speak French as well as I can .
Do I have to do that ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want one ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that story ?
Tom and Mary are going to like doing that .
You can smoke here .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll ask you more than that .
Tom wants Mary read what Tom said .
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t open his name .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This road be warm for over .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really sorry , are you ?
He took back for what he had told .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the old man .
I only have two children .
If you &apos;re here , I &apos;ll give it a call .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary was interested in that .
Tom bought nothing a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he wanted to get some early .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like to apologize to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who don &apos;t know him either of him .
Tom thought that Mary would like Mary .
There is no business in my room .
Tom was afraid to do that .
That could take .
Maybe we should be our office .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was kind of old .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you live , watching ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it up all night .
How was tomorrow ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that possible ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your report ?
I &apos;d like to see Tom .
I &apos;ll catch the train .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the glass on water ?
You aren &apos;t like the other kids .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of water ?
I plan to cook until I dance .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll name the truth .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t talk about you .
They enjoy listening .
The baby will be hurt .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two people are hot .
Tom is talking in his school .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should buy his car .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you exactly guilty ?
Tom asked Mary if she was happy with her new job .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are fun to be together .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again ?
Please don &apos;t be coming with me .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you absolutely OK ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you stay there from ?
Why don &apos;t we just ask anything ?
Tom hasn &apos;t started yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me interesting ?
Tom is good at singing .
Let me drive .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to call Mary in the hospital .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t quite much type of guy .
If you &apos;d asked me to help that , I would have some help .
Tom said that he was stupid .
We &apos;ve been asked to do that anymore .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble in October .
Tom is sitting alone to me .
I never thought Tom would do that .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in Australia .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him happy .
You &apos;re the only one who I know .
How did you come up with your girlfriend ?
Where do I know Tom from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never hurt Tom .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do that .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said he did something we can eat .
The teacher didn &apos;t stop talking .
You gave Tom the money , didn &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a vacation .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream comes true .
Tom closed his eyes and began to play .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you told me what &apos;s going on ?
They all look the same .
She did not know you were crazy .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink to work .
You have to see this .
Where will you be here ?
We were bored .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can &apos;t believe anything you don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he comes .
This is all .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never enjoy drinking .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can &apos;t do that ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m better .
I just wanted to say you you don &apos;t understand .
We have a big dog .
How was yourself today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary in the school .
This is a very old man .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s wife .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice are sisters .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret earlier .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good friend .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is supposed to rain today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a while .
I will take my heart .
What a cold !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The TV is in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why do I really would do that ?
I don &apos;t think we have to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop talking with Tom .
Don &apos;t say that word .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every afternoon .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly up to eat .
I thought you &apos;d like this job .
No matter what it do , you have to do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like us to do that .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m busy .
I come from Tom .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to know this again .
I &apos;d love to cook for you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I am ready .
I have ten books to write .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like beautiful .
I can &apos;t get wine .
I didn &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom first ?
I &apos;m told that Tom is very busy .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not crazy .
You don &apos;t have to go there .
Your children are him .
Tom sat under a tree .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can &apos;t make your decision ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s been .
She &apos;s a very good father .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to do that with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many people has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you feed Tom watch ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still around .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many fish did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too young .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If I &apos;d be the job , I &apos;d tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to answer it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to America .
Put his hands .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to go home .
Is there something you want to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can &apos;t even tell me where Tom says ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear his hat .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t eat very fast .
I always go to school , too .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I still weren &apos;t here anymore .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going .
They were afraid .
She had an answer to buy something to eat .
How do you know I &apos;m not Tom ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last night ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get to the way .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you so much ?
I couldn &apos;t find a book last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as simple .
What does Tom see in see ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a friend .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was surprised to haven &apos;t found it .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Tom ?
It &apos;s no right .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When I heard when he likes to , I know .
Tom , I &apos;m going on .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary doesn &apos;t like that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this machine ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even that when he wasn &apos;t ready .
He did what I wanted now .
You have to die .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What have you got doing with him ?
I remember the word .
You promised me Tom had to take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That man knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t lunch today .
Leave them awake .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not had less money in Australia .
It &apos;s not Tom &apos;s fault .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything that I asked for .
It looks great .
That was I been home .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom knows about school .
What &apos;s not like that ?
There isn &apos;t much enough food .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That isn &apos;t in the house .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might be here in Boston .
The book &apos;s next to have .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary have a lot of work .
Your French is looking for me .
It isn &apos;t as well as you .
Take the dog .
I &apos;ve got this right .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably supposed to say something wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve thought you &apos;d like me like this .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of them .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our piano .
Don &apos;t you feel sorry , Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was easy till that he was lying .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book was interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be crazy .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to finish this .
I know why you didn &apos;t remember me here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve lost a best job .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting in the car alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So where will you do ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what &apos;s supposed to do that .
It looks like to keep it .
This is still my brother &apos;s name .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about one .
I like the movie .
What were you doing when I first ?
Does she have anything ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right ?
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like telling him what I know .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the school .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a tie .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every day .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s quite better .
Tom loves his job .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;re here somewhere .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Tom asked me when he was ready .
I think that Tom speaks French .
Thank you for telling me .
He is proud of me .
Tom looked great .
Most of us around early .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is in the class .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love winter .
Tom and I were up all thirty .
How many times do you like this ?
She &apos;s about the same age as Tom .
Which is your son ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get paid when I was in Germany ?
I &apos;ve decided what I wanted to be happy .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to understand that .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to see you couldn &apos;t see .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of work is in the world .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very careful to Mary .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant we went to Japan .
I read rice last night .
I have a house two months alive .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom if he knew it .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you saying something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed as if nothing else happened .
I can &apos;t go to the police .
Will you be about to leave ?
They grew angry .
Where can I find books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All I want to be happy .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a day ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His cat is at school .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that again .
Are you still mad ?
Just say about the accident .
They arrived too late .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she needed to tell her .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t gotten away .
Tom asked us to wait till Monday .
Tom is a very tall friend .
My mother won &apos;t go home .
Tom keeps on the same room .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom wanted to do that .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not difficult to be here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good heart .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very tired , weren &apos;t we ?
He didn &apos;t wait until by yourself .
I can stay .
What did Tom help ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for me .
She was the first guy I &apos;d help .
When you know what to believe .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to do that today ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone something .
Both him are sick .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the car .
Tom ate the stairs with me .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save my father .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I told you not ?
Tom can hardly see without his suitcase .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , I Tom .
Tom seems very angry , doesn &apos;t he ?
I can &apos;t remember what I &apos;m expected .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not saying it .
Tom should &apos;ve loved Mary with Mary .
Can you know how to take a break ?
I have not have that much to see .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How was he so angry ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is enough to eat lunch .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My sister ran away and began away .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have an umbrella on my glasses .
He died just for what &apos;s right .
The man sitting on that bench .
Don &apos;t be very careful .
He helped me carry the suitcase .
We &apos;re both at tennis .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Do you think that &apos;ll happen , please ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were both named each other .
I don &apos;t know where Tom will find .
Tom looks pretty .
We can &apos;t just fire Tom .
He &apos;s driving to say talking French .
I &apos;m used to living here .
Today is my sister &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to buy ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
I wanted to see Tom there .
Tom lived in Australia since three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me everything .
I love you .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s brothers .
Where &apos;s the new car ?
We can &apos;t have you waiting for us .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re fine here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this novel very much .
That isn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do that to help Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It is their last movie .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary , John , John last himself .
Who ate ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the best day I have to do .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has everything he wants .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to talk to Tom ?
Tom told Mary that he thought Tom was afraid .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the same solution .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was lying on the bench with Mary by car .
You &apos;d better start .
Tom will likely to be right .
This book is worth reading .
We don &apos;t care about what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his wife .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French anymore .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m swimming .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have one news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the guitar without a friend .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told you a secret ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like angry .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it says ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a friend off early today .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How cold is it ?
Thanks on it .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom &apos;s new job for me .
I never actually left to wait as anyone else .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what happened to me .
Tom said he was willing to do his best .
Can somebody hear her ?
Can you tell me where Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I think I need to do .
I don &apos;t like her husband .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the man .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you have it ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit confused .
I found the money that I had bought that .
Tom is almost six years older than Mary .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They will be proud of a long time .
We are our enemy .
Tom &apos;s usually plays tennis this afternoon .
How much is this worth ?
Tom visited us this year .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which one are Tom &apos;s ?
I hear the whole day you were here .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your homework ?
I know you &apos;re drunk in Boston .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind Mary .
That must not happen .
Her son is much in a bad mood .
Were you sure that &apos;s different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have no friends .
I was there .
How long are Tom and Mary are talking ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother always says he has no choice .
I just wanted to say that about you .
Those are my book &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re in Boston .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them pay .
Tom , I want to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that over there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk after you .
I get sugar as good .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know Mary had to do that .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It looks like in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is Boston next ?
Why are you here ?
They &apos;re almost waiting for it .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This apple can &apos;t fly .
What do you want to do by yourself ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the building .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to eat .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that of the money of Tom ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I could count in my parents .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of there .
Tom heard someone calling Mary .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him at my watch .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to Tom ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
Tom was still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my glasses ?
I looked at Tom .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father became old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these English ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars on everything .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would come soon .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like brothers .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to know how to do that .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man man helped me .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to go today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the window .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as I used to .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This is the same place I loved .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to like us to go .
It can &apos;t be as funny as you .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk .
I guess you &apos;ll be doing that .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom where is inside .
She advised him where he should stay .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s difficult to please go to school .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re all done .
I wish Tom were more .
It is difficult to please TV .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and Mary had nothing to do .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting might take a week .
Tom can &apos;t handle this with me .
Tom had a chance to help Mary .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a woman who I &apos;m sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never decided to come anymore .
Come back in .
This store is the one .
Here on Monday &apos;s ?
Tom told me that I &apos;d rather Boston .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now &apos;s phone .
What were you doing up there ?
I have the same problems as you want .
Thanks for asking Tom .
I need to ask you for a little favor .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to my place ?
Tom &apos;s confused .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone tell you ?
I met Tom .
Did you really want that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in Australia and three children .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At of , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me today &apos;s paper , please .
What don &apos;t you guys do ?
I &apos;ve never been married yet .
Tom didn &apos;t promise .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read a book ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said away .
I understand .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean ?
There may be some right in your future .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can &apos;t do that without you .
Please do something .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our phone .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday I &apos;m early .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the shy .
I can &apos;t remember asking you .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several months .
Tom can &apos;t find a house .
This picture is much for me for three years .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , but she hasn &apos;t yet .
I will go home early .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his home .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your place .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t dance well , but I haven &apos;t feel so well .
What else did I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s getting too short to talk with you .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What what does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t for what I told you .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
Japan is very big .
My father takes me a cup of coffee .
Tom speaks French much better than Tom .
He &apos;s still sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to see Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom hungry ?
I had him fix my name .
Do you want to see a chance , Tom ?
Tom only has one .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really worried about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the summer ?
How did you pay last night ?
You sit on the phone .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys looking now ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a favor ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what John would &apos;ve done all the truth .
Come with me , but I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it ?
Tom , are you up with you ?
Tom is so kind of money .
I must tell you what I want to tell you .
Tom seems mad .
Tom has always loved you .
Tom had nothing to say at his mind .
Did you put me out to eat ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The rain is light on mine .
I think you &apos;ll be careful .
I sat next to him .
I slept home .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be very honest .
This must be the place .
Tom hasn &apos;t been found that .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find you .
I need to ask you some questions .
You wouldn &apos;t know where Tom says .
It &apos;s too warm .
I &apos;m glad I told you .
I found the apple .
He did nothing to buy all work .
Do you know what Tom wrote ?
Do you want to leave now ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is all there .
The old I am confused .
How often do you talk to Tom ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my opinion to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both really possible ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that .
You &apos;d better go home once as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at Tom .
I don &apos;t want to go see my parents .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to talk to the help .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any problems .
He asked me if I had much time last year .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , and not do you .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar is my age .
Tom needs help now .
How hot school are you ?
When does Tom want Tom to be there ?
When should we come to do this ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a moment .
I wish I &apos;d find something .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should have understood yet .
Tom pretended he wasn &apos;t expecting it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t forgotten everything .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to swim .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom buy that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope Tom &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn .
I think I should probably do that .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let Mary in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I care about is the train .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like better too happy .
I went to school .
The dog doesn &apos;t know where Mary needs .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me crazy .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That man really kissed him .
I found this song by myself .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you , not all , don &apos;t you ?
My mother could speak five minutes .
Tom has to go to school early .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that .
Tom became really confused .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining except .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not going to happen .
Here &apos;s what we want to do .
I always feel happy today .
It will not better than another questions .
What color is Tom &apos;s ?
It was a different to that .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book to your mother .
Tom gave his money in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give Mary what I asked for .
You were busy .
I like both cats .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you like Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you a friend .
I &apos;m only one of your friends .
I &apos;d like a name .
Where &apos;s Tom from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer might have to do it .
I &apos;ve been to Boston only .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how expensive is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother in the morning .
What pretty flowers !
I &apos;m mad at it .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to do .
Why can &apos;t we just be in Boston ?
The fire is our enemy .
I am glad to help him .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather will do .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
He left next Monday .
Tom gave me a new camera .
He believes that that .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to make me money .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a plan of death .
I don &apos;t think anybody can talk to me anymore .
What are the men doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone ?
Is this love ?
That used to war , doesn &apos;t it ?
Everyone may move .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her a lot yesterday .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was cute .
He may be on next Monday .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember your address ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are looking for John .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you &apos;re safe , you know the truth .
There is a cat on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom would like better than Mary to do .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had come home .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of hot ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t over in business .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even make that great .
I am confused .
It &apos;s Monday .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can &apos;t afford to do that anymore .
Tom found the key he was looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all these men ?
How far is it from here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too hot .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as simple .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom not the best .
Tom , Tom , John and John can &apos;t die .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do nothing is new .
Tom asked Mary what kind of car .
He paid me a lot of my mom .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only problem Tom .
We had fun with them .
Can we do this again ?
I was worried about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything .
I hope that &apos;s true .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your needs no longer a good idea .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is how Tom and Mary got married .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very short .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something that Tom wants to do to me ?
No one &apos;s perfect .
I &apos;m going to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that she died .
She did not need here .
My dog loves him .
Is there anything else I &apos;m supposed to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every answer in her book .
How else I you been here longer ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom also his wife .
I &apos;d have let you know if they had known .
I can &apos;t leave today now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the news I say .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
You &apos;re your wife .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had never gotten married .
I heard Tom &apos;s in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a job .
Tom has left the classroom .
It &apos;s not too hot to learn .
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I stole your money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
I arrived from like him .
How fast did you go ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the car , too .
Tom has three heart .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d not do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to do anything , you don &apos;t have to worry .
Tom has to go see Mary .
You tried to know Tom &apos;s a new friend .
This woman is very old .
That girl did a lot .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s house .
Look at Tom &apos;s fault .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the cat ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that Tom might have kissed .
He knew it all there .
The tall man began here .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a new job , Tom .
This book is less enough than one hour .
I don &apos;t know what Tom said .
I like listening .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This book &apos;s bad .
I &apos;d better take a good job .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind of tired .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at all .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his desk , please .
These aren &apos;t for .
I tried to sing , but I won &apos;t .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know meeting .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some books to read .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what &apos;s wrong .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you said to do it .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything else you want to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s language , but we aren &apos;t work .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from John .
I told you Tom was quiet .
You &apos;re driving here .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I said .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s large finished thirty French .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been from Boston .
What time do you call home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom .
If possible us could help us .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the way to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get married .
I don &apos;t have the same idea in this .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How big are they ?
I &apos;d like for you a favor .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her hair .
Tom could &apos;t come .
Tom put on the clothes .
You don &apos;t stand a chance from me .
Tom is hard to learn .
You must go to bed .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually love going abroad .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it was impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work till tomorrow .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the exam .
Tom is a friend &apos;s best here .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I also know how to play the guitar .
Tom wants a lot of money .
I know how busy you know .
You can &apos;t believe Tom .
Tom said that he thought Mary needed to do that .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;ll do .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The boy fell into soccer .
My name is you .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good for this money .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was here .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way now .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What &apos;s inside the city ?
It would be at home , but I &apos;ll buy it .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m saying .
Our team lost the war .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a thing .
I can &apos;t decide without yet .
Our teacher seems tired for three years .
I think it &apos;s time for my friend .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I sit all .
