Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do .
I can &apos;t want anything I want from you .
I think it &apos;s better not to understand it .
This isn &apos;t so simple .
I &apos;ve made a little at swimming with Tom .
Is he going to make it ?
That was listening .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to carry .
I found it to solve the problem .
It &apos;s stupid all the time .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary &apos;s from Mary &apos;s eyes .
They are proud of his daughter .
It &apos;s time to have no good news .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call last week ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on going .
I didn &apos;t know you .
There are nobody left there .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you &apos;ll come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house all .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that .
The concert was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married for Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for you .
Tom sat down at the floor .
It fell warm .
I feel talking in golf .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very happy .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman took the fire .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his work .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to leave the exam .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in front .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom really talk busy with you .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take for three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary and Alice .
You drank too much .
All of us swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary was busy .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat the time .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very little water left .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was drunk , well .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on ?
Tom likes food food .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played together almost every day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always good ?
I have to do it yourself .
Let me know what I can do to do .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A hat &apos;ll expensive it .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work this weekend .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed them in the plan .
He could not get able to give Mary not .
I &apos;ve become the same answer the question .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole story .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may decide your key over .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a watch ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for us ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my office to work on time .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m born in many years .
I bought a camera two days .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking beer .
He is lonely by everybody .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him .
I think Tom will never listen .
You were with Tom at eight today .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was the concert because I &apos;m going to see her .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When &apos;s someone to go to Boston ?
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was far from here .
When were Tom hiding ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m taking your bus .
Do you really want to stay here for a second ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We tried that Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live .
You can &apos;t read French , don &apos;t you ?
It looks like I want to say , too .
I &apos;m really happy of you .
You should have done that .
I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my uncle ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That looks simple enough .
You &apos;re really kind , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could swim every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is next Monday .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still outside for us .
Are you drunk now ?
I understand that Tom is there .
How has Tom asked us ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine day .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it .
There is a big break .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The time &apos;s over there , too .
I &apos;d rather not go today .
This has been your decision .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
This bike is clear but she has changed .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you please look at ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What what she said was not true ?
I &apos;m not really happy about this now .
My father came along the window .
I &apos;m ready about Tom .
We were very disappointed about that .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary must meet each other together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly where you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many people are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known that I &apos;d be at all happy .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a child .
That was really fun .
A car is empty .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October last morning .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A bus will take five minutes .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody left you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this morning .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there by himself .
He called her every day .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring this ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still want that Tom doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked into the kitchen .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all day .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How it is Tom ?
Give us three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom to Boston ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The park is from ice .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his daughter .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time after you and Alice .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need face .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m not around the class anymore .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really sorry that Tom will like Tom .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a friend who &apos;s a child .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this cold ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t like to go ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak French only three years .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me if you are .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You have the right news .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get off in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once .
Did Tom say what &apos;s happening ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t count to me .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some answer to do .
Can you explain my daughter ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This telephone drinks three days .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really interested in any danger .
He took off what he wants .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the night over across the street .
I only have two children .
She &apos;s next to see .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to learn some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys going to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way Tom loves me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who know him do that .
Tom thought that Mary would like that .
There is no house in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his names .
That can &apos;t drive party .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s brother .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat from fish ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it buy it by the time .
How was Tom &apos;s party ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that a big dress ?
It &apos;s important that you do that .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your husband ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive later .
How could that surprise me ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the boss ?
You aren &apos;t like the other kids .
Tom hardly ate anything for .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another cup of coffee ?
I plan to leave there as soon as I can .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I have no one for me .
They try .
The baby seemed to be famous soon .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You are everything I want to be .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both .
I wonder what I should read .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could understand it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you both friends ?
Tom asked Mary not to do something with Mary .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are friends to be .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be fine again ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still don &apos;t remember .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog crying .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn to help us ?
Why don &apos;t we talk about myself ?
Tom hasn &apos;t had eaten yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me ?
Tom is good at speaking .
Let me buy you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should go .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past six .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school very years .
Tom went in her house .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as beautiful as Alice .
If you &apos;d better to see it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been asking to help Tom .
Tell me more .
We do what we want to .
I know I &apos;m in love now .
Tom was wearing a walk back to the hospital .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not sure Tom &apos;s opinion .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve done .
How did you come here ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s feelings .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do her .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly find it .
Tom said that he would do this .
The little don &apos;t understand .
You gave Tom that question .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to anybody anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a bicycle .
I didn &apos;t expect this word .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just want a little time .
His dream went true .
Tom closed his eyes and closed the door .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you for your computer ?
They all look the same .
She had eaten well .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why I don &apos;t want to .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This camera is clean .
I &apos;m pretty quite Tom &apos;s grandfather .
Tom could do it .
This happens .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand .
I found this book .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not scared who am older than Tom .
I just wanted to say things .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in prison .
He will soon be a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very tall tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice are running .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know us sooner or later .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good mistakes to tell us .
Where did you leave your eyes ?
It is too beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom in the house .
I will take you for a swim .
What a nice baby !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The cat is in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly I would do with you ?
I don &apos;t think we need time .
I do what I am .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t really say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough children .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every day .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in that .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly anything to eat .
I thought you wanted this job .
So matter what you do , you don &apos;t have to do your best .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here hard .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to learn this .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to let you love . I don &apos;t want to .
I am ready .
I have every book I can &apos;t do .
Who will take care of the river ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished .
He &apos;s just quite alive .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase open .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a coat from Tom .
I never learned his name .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom alone , Mary or Mary ?
I &apos;m told that Tom isn &apos;t here .
It doesn &apos;t matter like that .
I &apos;ll do what I want to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to help him .
Your children live .
Tom sat under a tree .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three days .
Can you ever want to go ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s really been .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand him .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like me .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get for off ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many books did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too big .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t have the phone , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you surprise it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom .
You &apos;re always here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that bird .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can you tell you what &apos;s going on ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear when he &apos;s young .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt happy .
I don &apos;t drive well .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t even see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to the movies .
They were afraid .
She needed to learn something to buy something .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last year ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the beach .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have room .
Are you sure Tom &apos;s the one who lives here ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon often come back , let me know .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to see it but you .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was no old friend .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a house .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When was so satisfied with his own money ?
I think what it will understand .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little tired .
My parents are both dead .
What is the weather going to here today ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even when he was dead .
He did what I wanted to do .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d better leave .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That &apos;s part where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an shirt .
We aren &apos;t going shopping .
Leave them alone .
Is there quickly ?
It &apos;ll rain yesterday .
I play tennis .
I have not have anything to eat tonight .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary go .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I can .
It looks great .
When I saw her boyfriend &apos;s the table .
Tom walked through the street .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in his house ?
There isn &apos;t much time .
I really should &apos;ve listened .
He started a new car .
That wasn &apos;t home yet .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t going to be there alone .
The book was full of order .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have a lot .
Your French &apos;s really love .
It isn &apos;t as strong .
Take the dog .
I &apos;ve got to do this job .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with my sister .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re still doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got three help .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had done that .
Is your family here ?
I &apos;m not afraid of death .
I &apos;m getting tired of that .
That made me my decision .
This is our only offer .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
You &apos;ll ask Tom when he told me that .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book was interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take this time for a long time .
I know why you came here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just had a girlfriend .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So where you were ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let me come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what &apos;s wrong .
It looks as if it is going to rain .
This is not your dictionary today .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you if I don &apos;t want to .
I like it .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
That never been a long time .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right .
Do you want me to give me a hand ?
I feel like being happy for him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young for the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was late .
Tom wants to buy a new pair of shoes .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s better .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you rather play tennis in golf ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of my family .
Tom looked great .
Most people love ice cream .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love them .
Tom and I were up in the city .
How many times do you want to buy coffee ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your shirt ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get sick when he was in prison ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason not to go .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it better .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report by tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A teacher is empty .
Tom knew he &apos;d be very hungry .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The village you was asleep .
I read that book .
I have a head driving .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom ever tried to sing .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no one .
I can &apos;t go to the movies with .
Do you be going to be this house ?
They are laughing .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is for you to be happy .
I &apos;m really busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years .
You don &apos;t need to worry about everything .
Are you still mad ?
I went to Boston three years late .
They arrived too early .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary were outside on .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very friend , but he &apos;s not hungry .
My mother doesn &apos;t look at home now .
Tom keeps on the rules .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was exactly what Tom said .
I didn &apos;t ask you to help me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that he said that .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were looking for over .
He didn &apos;t see his speech .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary .
She was listening to Mary .
When you know , let you know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before Tom .
Both her parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the love .
Tom ate the medicine .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to Boston .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said it .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I got to you ?
Tom can hardly see without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing .
I can &apos;t remember what I asked him .
The door wasn &apos;t open .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you didn &apos;t want to dance ?
Please be not here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with him today .
Can you show me on your glass of water ?
I have not had a chance to see that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come did you open ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is dead .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat will have never left .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My mother went out .
I do the others to apologize .
He stood up for her .
The man sitting on that chair is new house .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me the shop .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
Do you want to go to Boston that ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were choice .
I don &apos;t know where the watch is .
Tom looks very bad .
We can &apos;t just talk .
He &apos;s quite lonely enough enough Mary .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my only friend .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to see Mary swimming and Mary again .
Tom lived in Australia three years ago .
I &apos;m not careful .
I love you cook .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new ship ?
We can &apos;t have you finished for us .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new from here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to hear Mary .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve promised that I am .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to be willing to help Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It isn &apos;t our case .
Tom did it better .
Tom and Mary walked away , please .
Who saw you ?
You &apos;re my enemy .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look after he was tired .
That &apos;s all the time I took you .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who brought this picture ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with you cook ?
Tom told me that he really thought that he needs more .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was advised by Mary by himself .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is too difficult to blame again .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m too tired .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have bad news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the only look at his desk .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever have that recently ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it isn &apos;t true ?
You could have done it .
Whose house is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of weeks next year .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How old is it ?
What we &apos;re reading to you ?
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got going to buy it for you .
I never get to make people waiting for you .
I didn &apos;t drink tea .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to have anything to do with me .
Tom said he had no choice but to do that .
Can your father speak French ?
Can you tell me why I did that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary .
I think I &apos;ll see Tom .
I don &apos;t like that .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to wear her own .
I can &apos;t say anything at school .
Why do you have to study French ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both surprised for me .
I found the key that Tom had lost .
Tom is almost six feet old .
Tom is probably here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They will be a good doctor doing that .
We are the enemy .
Tom is still older than men do that .
How much is this worth ?
Tom visited us this week .
I &apos;ll return home .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the girl you were born here .
I &apos;d like to have a whole cake .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happened .
Thank you for wait .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom &apos;s not me .
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That happens almost quite simple .
Her name that Tom is happy .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary some family ?
I don &apos;t think you like me .
My mother said it &apos;s mine .
I just wanted to show me your help .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you still are still dead .
I &apos;m proud to be a doctor .
Let them pay .
Tom , I want you to have .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with John .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all comes in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is the family ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost tired .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you need to do ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another story .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last night .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are you ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s the chair that ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that right .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I could give up my French .
They have those books .
These shoes are to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone singing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it by the train .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look for you ?
Is that Tom Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The water is still warm .
I do not understand you .
Did you sleep a little ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father must be old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote this medicine ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I take your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars off from her .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be happy by us .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I feel very sorry now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do you do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man must be careful .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to leave today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never seen Tom as soon as I love Mary .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the hotel .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember and see us dancing .
Why have you been so busy ?
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before before .
I guess you &apos;ll be eating tomorrow .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom , what are you ?
She advised him where he should buy .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom what he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it you want to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost .
I haven &apos;t told Tom what I want .
It is difficult to understand this winter .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have some friends to do .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved Mary .
The meeting will take place next month .
Tom can &apos;t handle this now .
Tom had a chance to work .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a solution .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never had to do anything without your help .
Come back in .
This camera is the same as that one .
&quot; Whose umbrella is this ?
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now wasn &apos;t ready .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same dictionary as you have .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a moment .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to see your parents ?
Tom &apos;s hands aren &apos;t going on .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , aren &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would you do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something is from Australia .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I don &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me these days , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been so busy before .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their family .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you want to convince him about ?
I could see you to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said he &apos;s tired .
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you plan to miss you ?
There may be out anything about it &apos;ll happen .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before I hurt .
Tom can do that all day .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll be able to help you .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me from your help ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
He goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was late .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who can help me .
I can &apos;t see you like anything .
I &apos;m going to stay with us for three years .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This is good hat for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t he ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his homework .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep today , so I don &apos;t understand French .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to America .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s close it , don &apos;t you , don &apos;t you ?
Who did you go there ?
I think Tom knows why Mary did that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this room .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a restaurant .
I &apos;ll be there .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father gets home almost every day .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him her address .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom are on the desk .
Tom can swim faster as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were looking at you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s right , right ?
This problem is hard .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the weekend .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as well as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what people would do .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , may we speak with us alone ?
Tom is trying to have more in Boston .
I used to play this evening .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you get Tom to drive Tom ?
Tom told me that he was late .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The summer is warm .
I think you &apos;ll be old .
I sat next to him .
I work six : 30 .
Tom is much younger than Mary .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can go , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the airport .
Tom hasn &apos;t been always honest with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the city yet .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the same age .
He did nothing but new brother .
Do you know what Tom was in prison ?
Do you want to try why Tom was here ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is worth its books .
The boy must try .
How often do you spend your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at speaking .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my opinion .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason you didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you finished what I said ?
Tom can &apos;t do that .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do it .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that .
You &apos;d better go home .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at nine .
I don &apos;t want to go to Boston .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d call .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me whether I had been well early .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary in the car .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar is my brother .
Tom needs help now .
How much are you thinking ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we go to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you were disappointed .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every day .
You should not speak ill of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in years .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t think that Mary has liked him .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your child will soon .
I think I should believe Tom .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I eat about .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like summer well .
When I came home , I was watching TV .
The sky has become dead .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking once a year .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That now is well .
I found the beach from school tomorrow .
Tom made that himself .
Tom was busy with his parents .
My mother was ten years .
Tom has to go to bed early early .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes probably stop .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always knew everything would happen .
It will not better than we left .
What ship did Tom buy ?
It was a small time .
He doesn &apos;t know how to get a bike .
The students must be happy .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for this .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have forgotten .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked for .
You were busy .
I no longer love dogs .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here .
I &apos;m on the way to say it to you .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this ?
They might be taller than you .
We speak French .
I &apos;ve been to Boston hard enough .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how to write it .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I already told my mother to arrive in the morning .
What are people eyes ?
I &apos;m planning to go shopping for you .
This is quite Tom &apos;s .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me .
Why can &apos;t we just leave without me here ?
The game is over .
I am taking your bicycle .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what she had done .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What are those ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I needed .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not not for money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is what we want to say .
I don &apos;t think people see us anymore .
What are the people doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you yet ?
Is this fun ?
That doesn &apos;t matter French , does it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it &apos;s .
What &apos;s wrong with your homework ?
I saw her father a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the phone .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in the meeting .
Tom and I are waiting for John .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
How much is your friends ?
There is a cat on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you just do that .
Tom is better than nothing about his homework .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had better idea .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of are you ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to be around .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever read in a new place ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that , but he did .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s before .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that .
Tom found the key he was looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are these children doing here ?
How far is it from here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too good .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not at all five years .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the matter .
Tom , Mary &apos;s probably hungry here .
We &apos;ll be back forever .
I do not feel good .
Tom asked Mary what she had had money .
He paid you a few questions .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom could do .
We had fun with me .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried about it .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as I am .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea is a good man .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
That &apos;s what you want us to eat lunch .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my car .
Can you remember the first time I met you ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very close .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say that to me ?
No one works .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog of coffee .
We did not want war .
My cat loves rice .
Is there anything else I can do you ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My friends hurt .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s how to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
We between play with her son .
How come you got here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my enemy .
I &apos;d have done for you .
I can &apos;t wait with you tonight .
This is the newspaper .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like me ?
I know what I want to say .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
You &apos;re the first guy I &apos;ve ever .
It &apos;s making mistake .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more more than tea .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had gotten sick .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a fun .
Tom has left the way .
It &apos;s not just Tom &apos;s brother .
I have no one to turn to time .
Who said Tom and Mary does ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; Have you seen my girlfriend yesterday ?
How fast were you true ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party .
Tom has three students .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do better for them .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go to Boston .
I tried to look Tom of out of my house .
This game is very heavy .
That girl can &apos;t work .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s house .
Look at Tom &apos;s now .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that Mary should apologize .
He knew it this way .
The man playing the piano .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a cup of coffee .
This book is easy for us to read .
I don &apos;t know what time was .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good time to ask .
This letter &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d like a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very scared .
Tom is kind enough enough to do it .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom &apos;s parents and Mary fall into his house .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried again , but I didn &apos;t see you .
That &apos;s a book .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of her books .
My mother has been ill for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know why you really looking for Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for that .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you want to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s cat on the bridge .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t speak French to each other .
I told you Tom would help us .
You &apos;re no longer now .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your letter for it ?
Tom &apos;s father runs faster than me .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish you had been true .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I wouldn &apos;t see Tom before .
If anyone can help French , I &apos;ll help Mary .
To tell you that I don &apos;t like it .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a Canadian .
That &apos;s what I said .
Just tell me the truth .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you even see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have the same mistake as you .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How far is it ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go .
Her name is her .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some bread .
You don &apos;t wear a chance to marry him .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your job .
I usually get home together .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have enough for her .
Tom is my friend &apos;s brother .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only know Tom to write to my face .
Tom bought a present for his phone .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
You can believe .
Tom said that he heard her name .
I don &apos;t know what I would do with you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The old news is worth that .
My cat is still by .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was listening .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how important Tom is .
Tom has been doing three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What kind of place was .
It would take at least three hours .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really actually actually actually .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I used .
Our lost lost the best woman .
That &apos;s my pictures .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read that book .
Our father looks young for her age .
I think it &apos;s time for me to go to bed .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my hair long .
