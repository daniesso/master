Be nice to her .
How come you know so ?
There &apos;s something that I want to leave before I do .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d left .
I think it &apos;s better not to do it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I wonder why Tom and Mary are on Tom .
Is he going to make it ?
Maybe they likes !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to find it .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s easy by us .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary died on Monday .
They are proud of her daughter .
It looks like you think you &apos;re doing this .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom sing last night ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats still inside the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow afternoon .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy by us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to be here in the river .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house for that .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I meet her with Tom ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The baby was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom sat half as it as I have to say .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my brothers and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that is , I &apos;ll be very careful .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The way didn &apos;t wear the book .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused to save him .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to travel .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows all that we don &apos;t .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about an hour .
Tom smiled behind Mary and Mary went .
You read too much .
All of them swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat less than your family .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very little room .
Are we going to eat lunch tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was lying , is it .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea better than coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your questions .
Tom and Mary played together almost every day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it far far from this ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I have to do with .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
Your house is it .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work this time .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not be disappointed at waiting .
I &apos;ve made the same way twice .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me French .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your room here .
Tom looked like he was sick .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my office to ask for my questions .
No one knows his story .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a camera yesterday .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking milk and read soccer .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many problems .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will learn a lot .
You were with Tom yesterday .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think Mary would like the answer .
I was able to meet , I can &apos;t live on .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
Please come to Boston at the station .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was true .
When should I say the clock ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m taking this news .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom convinced .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going to be , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looked like Tom to say more .
I &apos;d never go without that .
You should have changed so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three days ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple simple .
You &apos;re really good .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like it about it ?
I wish I could swim every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying Tom can &apos;t tell me French ?
I understand that Tom does that .
I have a lot better in Europe .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine of breakfast .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big big break .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out .
This has a question about the world .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very fast when he was gone .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put these in the box ?
I know .
Those are going to write , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What you say is not on the way .
I &apos;m not sure like this one again .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very young like that .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was hiding heart .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary couldn &apos;t sing together about this problem .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many times you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known you were , I could go , too .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is out of the car .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat is asleep .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody to see you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a doctor .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there anymore .
He called his job very much .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked across .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How is it ?
Give us three weeks .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The baby is living with us .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been working all this morning .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is this o &apos;clock .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need them anymore .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that she loves me .
That won &apos;t be possible .
I &apos;m really sorry that I want my son .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter who &apos;s a brother .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you want to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak French only well .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me possible .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French well as well as you .
Do I have to do that ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t want to know .
What &apos;s the name of that bird ?
Tom and Mary seem to be interested here .
You can make your own .
He was so cute he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once .
Did Tom say what happened exactly ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s very upset .
I didn &apos;t mind until it was so late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you use my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This train has been six years .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not going French now .
He took back a lot of his mother .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the old man across the street .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s right on I want to be in the airport . &quot;
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought Mary a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way she talks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those of him speak him .
Tom thought that Mary would like .
There is no interest in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take here .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s Canadian .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat , boy ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that the matter to the question .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that your hat ?
It &apos;s important that you told me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your weekend ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the news ?
You aren &apos;t happy .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to meet reading in an hour .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m tired I have you do that .
They enjoy meat &apos;s chance .
The baby seemed to be alive .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You can &apos;t afford to lose .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like books .
I think I should give my word .
We can &apos;t be Tom , but I forgot .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you still crazy ?
Tom asked Mary if she was sorry .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary work are listening .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived earlier than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary hates his husband .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t you learn how to dance ?
Tom hasn &apos;t written yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me .
Tom is good at doing .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in Boston .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s room .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as good as ever want to .
If you &apos;d ask someone for it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been good to decide .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting back on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help Mary , but he isn &apos;t .
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I know .
How did you come up with you ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I do your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s doing .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can give us .
The little girl did nothing .
You gave Tom the money I had to help .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his mouth and reading the horse .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you sure you for me ?
They all look the same .
She gave us a present , but she didn &apos;t .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why you don &apos;t like that .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll not see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he &apos;d gone .
This we can do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand them .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m better than Tom .
I just wanted to say thank you .
We have a big dog .
How was time tomorrow ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very pretty tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and John aren &apos;t happy .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret by yourself .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good teacher .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is likely to be fine today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a month .
I will take you for a girl .
What a nice idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The television are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly I I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough money .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I said about that .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly even anything .
I thought you wanted to dance .
No matter what you do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed from Australia .
He looked my heart .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here to work .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to think you &apos;re here .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to see you .
I am ready .
I have all things I need to change .
Who will take care of the next time ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital tomorrow .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see you .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you sing .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom and Mary first played golf ?
I &apos;m here for Tom .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work here .
Your children are healthy .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Which side he say ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always been .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times do Tom ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any longer .
It would be easy if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as he does .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many boys did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t do it , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl driving to walk .
Put out of us .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there anything you &apos;d like Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you tell me your name ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always supposed to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , but he used to .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt doing doing that .
I don &apos;t go away .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t sleep again .
Who sent you ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the way with me .
Tom loves going to church .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy something to write .
How do you know I &apos;m going to be hungry ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last year ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the station .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have better sleep .
What makes you think there was your time ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon , I know where &apos;s inside .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
This woman laughed at the tree .
I think what you need in need to eat .
Can you do it ?
I am a good student .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between that ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even , goes to church at that time .
He did what I said was right .
You have to be as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That woman knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t expecting yet .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be six o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not learned to eat this .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything of time .
It looks great .
When I am hungry at the airport .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t spoken into the difference .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That ended for your dog .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The old man was really different .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have just friends .
Your French is not new .
It isn &apos;t as we play soccer .
Take the taxi for a walk .
I &apos;ve only this this about you .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it is .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much time at the time .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family living ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me my choice .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat every day .
It was not until yesterday that I did that .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book sounds interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me .
I know why you came here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just lost my father .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat fish when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So language were you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what will listen to me .
It looks like you &apos;re very bad .
This is where I want this .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you at last night .
I like the way you were late .
What were you doing when I meet you ?
She seems likes her daughter .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the news .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right .
Do you want me to give you a passport ?
I feel like telling him what I think .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the list .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out of his office .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s quickly .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s a mistake decision .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Tom doesn &apos;t speak French very well .
I think that Tom does that well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of me .
Tom looked great .
Most boys love ice cream .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am reading .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were out that song .
How many times do you have paid here ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my mother .
Which is your guitar ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was in Boston ?
I &apos;ve got going to take Tom very much .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the exam .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that one before .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people think of the future .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very hungry .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant we went to the station .
I read books day you were late .
I have a head cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom if Mary said not .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the police with this .
Why didn &apos;t you want to dance with Tom ?
They haven &apos;t spoken French .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is like you .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really have it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His car is as old as Tom .
You don &apos;t need to worry about something .
Are you still mad ?
All the others were there .
They arrived too early .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t completely forgotten .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very good friend .
My mother used to meet right now .
Tom keeps on the world .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom said it was true .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that he used to come here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good man .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t start until it was a choice .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but he didn &apos;t come .
She was the first girl I &apos;d ever kissed .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Both her parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the teacher .
Tom ate the door by the plane .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I had to do that ?
Tom can &apos;t see without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing .
I can &apos;t remember what I asked Tom .
The door wasn &apos;t alive .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first saw Tom ?
Please do not live here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her .
Can you show me around this ?
I have not had a chance to see what happened .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come he didn &apos;t show her ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is off from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat ran away from it .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have the one to do that .
He stood up for what he said .
The man sitting on that is .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me a camera .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very small .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Not he want to go to Boston with you . &quot;
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were willing to do what you do about me .
I don &apos;t know where it is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just hit Tom .
He &apos;s father big hard enough .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my sister &apos;s friend .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to lose ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted Mary drunk and left there .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me .
I love you people .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t have you working with them .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new right , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to see why he was angry .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve use this watch very seriously .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It is their daughter .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary and John children will spend dinner last weekend .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like to play guitar .
That &apos;s the best news .
He can &apos;t work tomorrow .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this noise ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this ?
Tom told me that he wouldn &apos;t mind doing to do that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was willing to get along by himself .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be right .
This book is worth reading again .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can &apos;t ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m at home .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have you bad .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the book on to set .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told Mary how he died the ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like eating .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it is ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days off .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How goes to church ?
He &apos;ll always both friends .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never asked you to make the same mistake in time .
I didn &apos;t drink them crying .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to have to do anything to me .
Tom said he thought it was too poor to do .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is here ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing Tom again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I think I need to know .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that .
I can &apos;t say anything in this time .
Why do you have two cars ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit drunk .
I found the money that Tom wanted Tom .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They don &apos;t have to know how long works .
We are leaving the police .
Tom is two times of this work .
How much is this worth ?
Tom waited to school last night .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the day you were very hungry .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what is happening .
Thank you for up .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed for me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his eyes .
That must never happen .
Her son is good for me .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have you and Mary known each other ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother says is Tom &apos;s home .
I just wanted to say thank you all .
Those are my sister &apos;s students .
I &apos;m glad you don &apos;t enjoy it now .
I &apos;m proud to be a doctor .
Let them all .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have hardly good friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all started in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is Boston in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re twice as we are .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that building at the hospital ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d remember my word .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick job .
Tom heard someone calling .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a letter about Tom .
I spoke to Tom ever took a day .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were almost tired .
The baby is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my eyes ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father better old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars earlier .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be willing to help us .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying right now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me to hear that .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The piano ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as I love each other .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the train station .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a bit drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come from Boston .
It can &apos;t be dead as a joke .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before before .
I just don &apos;t believe you anymore .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve liked Tom .
Tom , where are ?
She advised him where he went .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want to do ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re done .
I wish Tom is spoken like you .
It is stupid to understand this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have some pizza .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take place .
Tom can &apos;t handle this word on his own .
Tom had a chance to support me the party .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a solution , too .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never tried to be understood what happened .
Come back in .
This isn &apos;t the same idea that .
&quot; Where is this ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Tom &apos;s . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now or not .
What were you doing out there ?
I have the same dictionary .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you to a good country .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the hospital for you ?
Tom &apos;s jokes exactly me .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would anyone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in my house .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three days .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me today &apos;s paper , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I don &apos;t have to say anything right with you .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to talk about that ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He is alone .
I understand seeing him .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean to do ?
There may be telling me what you say .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do doing that .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m really hungry .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the only one who stole my bicycle .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of your mother .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This noise is so good for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty older , but not brother .
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his birthday .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to school tomorrow .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s a nice way !
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to live in this room .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t mine for years .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father drinks a cup of coffee .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to school outside .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him my hands .
Do you want to see this , Tom ?
Tom only have one book .
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really thinking about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , too .
This problem is hard to answer .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get to sit at the station .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what other problem was in the room .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , we are doing that in my house .
Tom is trying to be into hard .
I brought something that I want to give you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on all .
Did you bring Tom to drive it ?
Tom told me that he was alive .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The cake is in big .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept off .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the problem .
Tom hasn &apos;t been just honest with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom all well yet .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can go on the beach .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I kept it .
I found the building .
He did nothing but goes there every day .
Do you know what Tom killed for lunch ?
Do you want to sing in Tom ?
How long will you be staying next ?
The soup is so hot I can &apos;t drink it .
The boy doesn &apos;t like me .
How do you you do this ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want him to laugh any longer .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know Mary .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you mind you already finished ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t do that without your help .
You &apos;d better go over as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at home .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help you .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any friends .
He asked me whether I was feeling well .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , too .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he &apos;s .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar in my desk .
Tom needs help now .
How many years do you think Tom ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had waited .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak ill of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been here yet .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t want to drink so much .
How am I going to do you ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope Tom will be soon .
I think I should probably help .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All boys care about .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like summer you live .
When I returned home , he was watching TV .
The sky has be clear .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made him study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That all looks well again .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t think of word .
My mother couldn &apos;t speak soccer .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes ever laugh right .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always knew this question .
It will not last one than three minutes .
What color is big ?
It was a woman .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students needs to lose it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a letter to you .
Tom lost his camera in school .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I bought .
You were busy .
I like both like cats .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in your place .
I &apos;m going to say it once in a problem .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our own things .
I &apos;ve been to Boston long .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how poor it is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my keys up .
What little eyes !
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking French next year .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what we live .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see you , you &apos;ll understand .
What country is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything he say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the women ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone ?
Is this Tom ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us , does it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your brother ?
I saw him once a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the country ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a hospital .
Tom and I are waiting for John .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s very hot this morning .
If you are hungry , I could eat the bread .
There is a cat on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you just have told me .
Tom would like to tell Mary what he needed to do the bicycle .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had better walk .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What part of say about you ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant hurt ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that before .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s old .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that .
Tom found the key he had been looking .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all you doing your house ?
How far is it from here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not cold in front of Tom &apos;s .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the word we could .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all see that together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I get lonely very pretty .
Tom asked Mary what kind of money .
He paid no friends to my friends .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom did .
We had fun with them .
Can we get this problem ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your question sounds like a good woman .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what you found me a chance .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you sleep the last time ?
I knew who was .
Tom is very impressed .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to you ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to go to school with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that can run true .
&quot; Do you want me , Tom ?
My hands cat to the country .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the very restaurant .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every French is in this lake .
How did you feel so busy yesterday ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my job .
I &apos;d let you let you know .
I can &apos;t help this now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the man I want to show .
Tom and Mary sat together .
You &apos;re the first girl I thought I was .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun of coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary was just tired .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t stay now .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a job time .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not really like Tom .
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I stole the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Were they eaten in bed ?
How many eggs were you ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to talk , you don &apos;t want to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk to you a friend of mine .
This man is very small .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the children ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he did John .
He knew it all along .
The fire talking to me is alone .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want the way it works .
This book is easy enough for children .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This letter is for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very happy .
Tom is kind of shy .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at Tom .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and put them on his desk .
These aren &apos;t important .
I tried again and again .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some books to read books .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what you said to say .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;ll do ?
Tom &apos;s office is almost in the meeting .
Tom and Mary were tired of a girl .
I told you Tom would help us out .
You &apos;re all welcome here alone .
Where is the matter ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word ?
Tom &apos;s having arrived out of the time .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been Canadian .
What time do you leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I can &apos;t see Tom again .
If you eat help , Tom &apos;s Tom .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like it .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;m beginning .
Tom isn &apos;t a real .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have time in the school today .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How come they are ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her eyes .
Tom could &apos;ve changed a secret .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t like a chance .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home just about 2 : 30 .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the table .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study .
Tom is a friend of my dog .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only wanted to hear how to play golf afternoon .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy you were .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I mean .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The bridge is very far from over .
My dress is very long .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good good for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough water .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way now .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a problem ?
What time and Tom can &apos;t swim ?
It would be very small for the news .
Don &apos;t let me go .
I must find work .
Thanks for your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I have written .
Our team lost the first time .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her age .
I think it &apos;s time for me to solve this problem .
I &apos;d like to have a job with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my eyes sing .
