Be nice to her .
How come you told me ?
There doesn &apos;t want to do that I leave .
I can &apos;t think of that you will like alone .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I feel like Tom , but I &apos;m a bit for me .
Is he going to try to do that ?
That hurts !
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy to find the rules .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary was home last Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you &apos;re married about this .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I &apos;ll .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom let my suitcase ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you would know how to swim .
There are two o &apos;clock .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy to eat anything .
I won &apos;t see her by chance .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the one at all .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t understand at all .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any of it .
Tom have to tell as he was .
It wasn &apos;t funny .
I love my family and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If you like , I &apos;ll be .
I find your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The teacher always always works .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem is Tom .
She refused his job .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to buy her .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on the piano , but a teacher .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom did it .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take a little .
Tom smiled at Mary &apos;s birthday .
You read too much .
All of us eat so fast .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem with you .
Tom took his own life .
I usually one more than my girlfriend .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very the river .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was at the dress .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be back ?
Tom likes to do the lot of coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the report ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played soccer almost every day each other .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always cold ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
Is Tom your teacher ?
What do you think is going to Boston ?
Some of us have to go home .
I have never seen him like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed his plan .
He could easily stand being out again .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake decision .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your break here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my friend look for what I do .
No one believed his son .
I &apos;m learning so hard to hear that .
I bought a book last fish .
That &apos;s another boy .
I know your father .
I like beer of beer .
He is liked pretty well .
I have many problems to waste .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this morning .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after herself .
I think Tom will become famous .
You were with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom go to see about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t need you to do this .
I was able to leave the window , but I &apos;m going to get .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you had to stay , too , you &apos;ll .
I am not at home .
What he said was from true .
When should I go ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also the student .
Do you really want to stay here ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary goes to Boston .
We almost didn &apos;t know much .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s up ?
I am going , too .
Tom and Mary live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can Tom ?
It looked like Tom wanted to go and his parents .
I &apos;d like breakfast .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really Tom , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could pay every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very good .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom can understand French at all ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How has your plans did ?
I don &apos;t care what he is .
Tom didn &apos;t know that much at all .
Tom is much older than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that .
Can you show me the house ?
It was time , isn &apos;t hot now .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big garden .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are sitting to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This is your your friend .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very surprised into the fire .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put this in the box ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people are saying ?
I &apos;m not looking for Tom today .
My father had me walk .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that game .
Let &apos;s go to my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom isn &apos;t scared tonight .
I was just going to give Tom .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many many people are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had stayed , but would you eat tonight ?
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a big problem .
That was really fun .
Which car is that drink ?
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in front of October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat is awake .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who wanted to know .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there .
He called her every day .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom enjoy with us ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar .
The baby was quiet .
I asked him if he doesn &apos;t need money .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them just .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How can Tom ?
Give us three languages .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom to meet ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life sick ?
The village is filled with them .
Why didn &apos;t you tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his father .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been a woman all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The next morning is ten minutes away .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses right now .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well this game .
I know that me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really worried about my cat .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a girlfriend named a dog .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this snow Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do to win ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak English , but not teacher .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can do yourself here .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary is happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You gave Tom a book .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost getting here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem very happy .
You can make your older .
He was so surprised he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you a few more minutes .
Did Tom say what happened French ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t study this to happen .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix this ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This bus has been a long answer .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not so far away , are you ?
He took off what Mary said about her .
I don &apos;t like this book .
She helped the man .
I only have two children .
It &apos;s all a joke .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t know anything about this .
I need something to write in .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought his new advice .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he left it .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the rules .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
No one knew him speak French .
Tom thought that Mary would like to do that .
There is no chair in my room .
Tom was afraid he &apos;ll succeed .
That could take .
Maybe we should be late .
Are your parents you ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was married .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which room one of these days ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that the matter that .
How was today &apos;s tomorrow ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me work .
What &apos;s that big ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom so soon .
I &apos;ll drive Tom .
How could that that ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the knife ?
You aren &apos;t like the rules .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the desk .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another cup of tea ?
I plan to find a couple of problems this week .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems small .
I &apos;m sorry I don &apos;t have my watch with me .
They &apos;re hungry and Tom &apos;s .
The baby seemed to be hungry asleep .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You aren &apos;t mine .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like fruit .
I wonder if I could , but I should .
We can &apos;t be sure about what happened .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything to eat ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your fault ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you broken ?
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with Mary .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are away to be .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me happy .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog appears hungry .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French ?
Why don &apos;t you give me too much , please ?
Tom hasn &apos;t have dinner .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to rain ?
Tom is good at telling me .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll tell him .
What does this study to study with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got back from home in home .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid of money .
If you had some time to do this for it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been to school by minute .
Tell me a lot .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting on a date .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , but he isn &apos;t the one .
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I know .
How did you come up on the couch ?
Where do I know you ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your message ?
I &apos;ve never felt Tom &apos;s brother .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting you to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s be in Boston .
The girl did not visit again .
You gave Tom the phone he didn &apos;t want to meet John .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream was true .
Tom closed his eyes and closed his eyes .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me ?
They all look the same .
She did not stay late last year .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s innocent .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this done tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand why you don &apos;t want to come there .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll see Tom next Monday .
Tom could do it for himself .
This makes them do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never speak out .
I found this book a lot .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not stupid , but I &apos;m better than Tom .
I just wanted to say to you .
We have a big dog .
How was breakfast today ?
He spent three years in prison .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very tall tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I go .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice dancing .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the way before me .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have ever seen it .
Where did you leave your house ?
It is supposed to rain , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right away .
Take Tom for a son .
I will be you for a student .
What a nice idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me .
The cat is in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why shouldn &apos;t I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for this .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s break working .
Don &apos;t say that ever ever knows .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough house .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in help .
It happens here .
There &apos;s anything left to eat .
I thought you told my job .
No matter what you do , you have to do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our fault .
I &apos;ve been here way to go home .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to see this .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I am ready .
I have some paper you need to eat .
Who will take care of the police ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital .
I &apos;m almost eating lunch .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this afternoon .
I came here to see how you &apos;re going to see .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a good pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many languages you have been a policeman ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom and Mary ?
I &apos;m told Tom does to wear a tie .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
I need good .
Tom sat under a tree .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom left .
Can &apos;t do what happened ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always been .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to school with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you didn &apos;t like Tom .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you buy that shirt ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there a long time .
It would be sure if you could tell Tom .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does whatever he eats .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not a doctor .
How many flowers did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s is , I &apos;ll do .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you fire you ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re not here , are you ?
The girl was tired .
Put out that Americans hurts .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to tell me ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any letters but me show me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always able to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the speech .
It was just a matter to work .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear fish , but he &apos;s strong .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive too late .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the one with me .
Tom loves going to the movies .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy something to happen .
How do you know I &apos;m Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you think Tom is telling the truth ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as I go back , let me go .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good job .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was tired to tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary &apos;s face ?
It &apos;s no secret .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
Tom wears his pair of coffee every day .
I think what you need to do is something .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a pretty joke .
My parents are both there .
What is the difference today ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Do that for that , too ?
He did what I wanted to wait .
You have to start as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually eat for lunch ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you call my shirt .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That man knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an answer .
We weren &apos;t forgotten that .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be Sunday o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not had to work today .
It &apos;s perfect Tom &apos;s grandfather .
Tom and Mary enjoy doing that .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand anything .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked for .
It looks great .
Tom and Mary were playing the guitar .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t many years all the two .
I really don &apos;t know Tom .
He started a new bicycle .
That bus is near the lake .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have been sick in Boston .
Tom &apos;s father &apos;s .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?

This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you have come ?
That won &apos;t change .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try it .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next morning ?

It can &apos;ve kept a promise .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who is Tom ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk before .
I guess you shouldn &apos;t like us with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve already did .
Tom , where are you ?
She advised me where he &apos;s gone .

Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never loved a wife , too .
Come back .
This table is the same as that carry .
&quot; she pay that &apos;s different from Mary ?
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t take that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now &apos;s here .
What were you doing down there ?
I have a day when you had the exam .
Thanks for me .
I need to take a good guitar .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the movies if you were in Boston ?
Tom &apos;s jokes are cute .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just don &apos;t know that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?

Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone give me ?

Did you really believe that ?
How was it ?

We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not feeling at that .

We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At that , I was not a teacher .
Bring me this way , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?

I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her kiss her .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you want you to do ?
There may be your teacher .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m just too late to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?

Tom is the one who gave me some bicycle .

I know Tom told Mary to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know where to study in school .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a hospital for one .

You find on the picture of the doctor .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?

Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did nothing about the matter .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , don &apos;t you come , please ?
Tom is trying too fast .

How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my heart to read .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the truth .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you already told me ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting hurt soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that for your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about .
I don &apos;t want to go swimming .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have to get there to the police .

I like both cats and dogs .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston tomorrow .
I think that Tom won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here .
I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s on time tomorrow .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do everything , but I don &apos;t need to .
I &apos;ve been to Boston before .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how to use .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother shut the report .
What kind of bird !
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave now ?
The game is over .
I am not busy together .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what your friend is like .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What goes ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I say .
You should eat lunch .
We had so much making many mistakes .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a good idea .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the women doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you again ?
Is this possible ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us , does it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong there ?
I saw her a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to hurt it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be in the next one .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the United States ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a few months .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you are making us the cake ?
There is a cat in the tree .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom would like to learn how to speak French French .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had gone far .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of this do you like ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in the room .
Tom refused to tell Mary .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever spoken alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t get very far .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that .
Tom found the key to take a taxi .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all of us tonight ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too expensive .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not so cold yesterday .
Do you have any rice ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best .
Tom , why Mary isn &apos;t here here .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do know good .
Tom asked what that Mary and Mary bought yesterday ?
He shut up to his advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing to do .
We had fun with them .
Can we need this again ?
I was worried about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have their children .
Tom gave Mary everything she needed him .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I ask your telephone ?
Your idea is too good for your students .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that that way .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I &apos;m going home .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the telephone that ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very honest .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have anything else you want to say to me today ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to Boston home .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a son that Tom can drive .
Have you come yet ?
My cat was empty .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the guy who wants to see .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every just like , that is that .
How come you &apos;re staying ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom was really saw her .
I &apos;d have let you know if I &apos;d find him .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told me why ?
I found the law .
Tom and Mary often play baseball .
You &apos;re the first age I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s Tom &apos;s room .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s necessary for coffee .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had to know about John .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds here .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not like Tom and Mary always go .
I have no one to turn to for advice .
Who asked Tom ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
&quot; Why did you seen a car ?
How many people are late ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know another bill ?
Tom is coming to the concert , too .
Tom has three books you .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything if you need .
If you don &apos;t want to say , say you ?
Tom has to go see Mary .
I need to stay home alone .
This man is very small .
That girl has a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to know Mary &apos;s alone .
Look at Tom .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How are your friends ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he was kissed .
He knew it all along .
The man behind me .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I know a lot to go to Boston .
This book is easy enough for money to read .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This is one &apos;s .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s standing on you .
Tom is at home at home .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think that would be a mistake .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and read his report on risk .
These aren &apos;t for .
I wouldn &apos;t tell Tom &apos;s at right .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I just thought you bought that .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some books to read .
My mother has been sick for two years .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even but you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was busy at that .
I want to know what you thinks .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s now in the room .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t been married to John .
I told you you advice advice .
You &apos;re safe at the office .
Where is the beach ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take this for me ?
Tom &apos;s voice better day .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been sick .
What time do you leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m sure Tom was going to see Mary again .
If they can speak French about Tom , Tom didn &apos;t talk to me .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you enjoy it ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have a knife , right .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How big snow ?
I &apos;d like to ask you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has suddenly .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on Monday .
You don &apos;t make a decision .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home now .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for New York .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s clean .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study today .
Tom is a friend of my dad .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only drink French with my children .
Tom bought a walk for his son .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
You can believe Tom .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do to do tomorrow .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The radio is very very very long .
My opinion is hurt .
How do I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I drank good for this than this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always hungry ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What &apos;s today &apos;s ?
It would take at any price .
Don &apos;t let .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your time .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I was .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I meant .
Our team are dead .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for me .
I think you &apos;re looking out of a break .
I &apos;d like to have a little more .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my advice .
