Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to be done .
I can &apos;t want anything to want .
I think it &apos;s not going to rain it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked for Tom , but I can &apos;t .
Is he going to it ?
That happens again .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s down here .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary was dead .
They are proud of mine .
It looks like you &apos;re my type .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He fell tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom leave ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are got an apple into the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never never told anyone .
We &apos;d be able to do that by yourself .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the camera to Tom .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m taller than you .
I know Tom does .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom sat just going very hard .
It suddenly suddenly started .
I love my brothers .
Today , I have a lot for you .
If what happens , I &apos;ll be right .
I see your ball in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman took the key to the seat .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let me read a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I miss it ?
I just want to her hot .
I have never done this before .
The coffee is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows that you .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom looked up , but Mary doesn &apos;t usually go to .
You read too much .
All of them changed .
Tom said that Mary knew you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem here that you don &apos;t know .
Tom took his own company .
I usually eat less than my friend .
What are you going in ?
There &apos;s very little milk .
Are we going to see some tea ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the police .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill , but I now .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes without sugar .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now here .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your mother .
Tom and Mary played tennis together together together .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always getting cold ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
The trip he were lost .
What do you think is going to Boston ?
Some of them are going to work this weekend .
I have never seen anyone like her .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand hungry when I met him .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake myself .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your bag here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some money ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to tell .
Tom came to my office to work for this .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m so much from you .
I bought a book two months ago .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like them yesterday .
He is like by everybody .
I have many food to buy .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s boss .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never become young .
You were with Tom , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was able to read the book , but I &apos;m born .
How are you doing ?
I know this is easy .
When you come to Boston , Tom ?
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said is true .
When should I saw the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re back .
I &apos;m supposed to take this ship .
Do you really want to go here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom well .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to speak French .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his friends live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , either .
It looks like Tom wanted to marry her , but he didn &apos;t .
I &apos;d do without it .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems kind enough to be .
You &apos;re really pretty , too .
Tom can answer the joke .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could play tennis every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been waiting for you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom can &apos;t understand ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How newspaper your suitcase will take ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that much jokes .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a better deal .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big city .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach .
I &apos;d like to go out today .
This has been your letter .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very kind to Mary .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put anything in a piece ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What languages are you going on here ?
I &apos;m not sure if I see your umbrella .
My father had me home .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that .
Let &apos;s go into my room .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary won &apos;t live together together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many are you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had listened , I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
Tom seemed lost .
Now &apos;s not a doctor .
That was really fun .
A car is very kind to English .
I never wanted to leave home .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A book is warm .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s life and Mary .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there alone .
He called her every day .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did you bring with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was dark all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t worry about them .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How large is Tom ?
Give us three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The room is filled with bread .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his age .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been on the work all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The island is ten minutes late .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need meat anymore .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m so worried that Tom isn &apos;t going either .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a boyfriend .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this school Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can not speak to him about the meeting .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom .
I like pizza .
I think you &apos;re fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me to do that .
Tom bike Mary was glad .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t come .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what he meant ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive until it was too late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This window was broken .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not just in danger , are we ?
Tom took back what he had written for him .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the room .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s a bad , I would give it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do it like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who my sister is .
What are you reading to my mother ?
Tom can &apos;t come .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those books are not bad .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no other left .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
Tom can get working .
Maybe we should be there .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s friend .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one to get the party .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat breakfast ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter .
How was today &apos;s meeting ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me walk .
What &apos;s that the newspaper ?
It &apos;s likely it be raining .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your hope ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the knife ?
You aren &apos;t like the good .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of water ?
I plan to leave the hotel every day .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll get the name .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I don &apos;t have my mind with me .
They went to Australia .
The baby doesn &apos;t remember fast .
Give me a book .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You aren &apos;t your friends .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should thank him .
We can &apos;t be able to translate this sentence .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen this .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you both crazy ?
Tom asked Mary if she was happy with her .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are fun to understand .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot tonight ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary kissed him .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we eat rice and rice ?
Tom hasn &apos;t played yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me ?
Tom is good at doing .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should give up .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy has a baby .
Tom wanted to live in Boston .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s house .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as old as Mary .
If you &apos;d asked for me for it , you would &apos;ve said better .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been to not here so long .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble at this sight .
Tom was sitting on a bench .
I never thought Tom would be here .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in Paris .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I wanted him to read everything .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve heard .
How did you come up yet ?
Where do I know you to ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your bike ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing we can do .
The question is nothing is simple .
You gave Tom the money he asked me .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this book .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his eyes and he played baseball .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for something ?
They all look the same .
She did the work before .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a new job .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you do this one tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can do whatever you want to do it .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This we can do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand how .
I found this book very hard .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not Tom &apos;s mom .
I just wanted to say no one .
We have a big family .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary the picture .
This is a very good speech .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw him , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s staying for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John want to meet him .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the truth sooner or later .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good things to read it .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is taking this medicine , is it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a camera .
I will take you for a few minutes .
What a good idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he &apos;d do that before .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let me stop playing baseball .
Don &apos;t say that word .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough beer .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I should do in that .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly left left .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you have to do .
We got married very young .
Tom turned three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine here .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our cat .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to remember this game .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to go to you .
I am ready .
I have written I could write to Tom .
Who will take care of the cat ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital .
I &apos;m almost finished with your grandmother .
He &apos;s just like that .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase open the door .
I came here to see me .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a message for Tom .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you the proposal .
How many years have you doing yesterday ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom first ?
I &apos;m doing that out on Sunday .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work hard .
Your children got famous .
Tom sat out a horse .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can it else be done ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s been .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his friends .
I don &apos;t have enough to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that out ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now ever get it .
She doesn &apos;t live here anymore .
It would be great if you could trust .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can trust .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom usually does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to meet .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many flowers did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If I should see Tom , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put when you see that .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you know where Tom is ?
I don &apos;t think that we &apos;re fun .
It isn &apos;t always going to do that .
Tom needs the money .
I want to know why he was born .
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the story .
It was just a piece of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t listen to his jokes .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than Mary .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t forget Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to drink .
They were afraid .
She needed something to solve .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you alone with you ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have done it later .
What exactly did Tom idea Tom ?
I couldn &apos;t make a speech last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as I expected it to tell me what I wanted to see .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to see with it .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When Tom knew when to the concert , then ?
I think what you &apos;re thinking about Australia .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this and that ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even there , but &apos;s well well , I would tell him .
He did what I wanted to do .
You have to run as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you take for that ?
I remember the word .
You may take care of you book .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That boy knows .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t married yesterday .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play famous .
I have got nothing to eat tonight .
It &apos;s possible .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I &apos;ve .
It looks great .
When I came with my shoes .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s that why ?
There isn &apos;t much difference between the two boys .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new guitar .
That boy is in the room .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might go to Boston next week .
The book is interesting .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary have a few friends .
Your French is really good .
It isn &apos;t you who helped the ball .
Take the dog for children .
I &apos;ve got this one to do that .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to see Mary .
I &apos;ve got very much better .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your help .
Is your family here ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me carry my mind .
This is our ball .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not until yesterday .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book has already .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;s quite cold for a long time .
I know why you see me here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just got the best friend I &apos;ve been to do that .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch .
I couldn &apos;t speak French when I was a little taller .
I do not like this song .
So where are you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was fine .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what to believe , don &apos;t you ?
It looks as if it is going to rain .
This is quite the way .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is as young as a child .
I want to talk to you about these .
I like the way it often .
What were you doing yesterday ?
Does she have come ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right ?
Do you want me to give you a pencil ?
I feel like telling him what I think .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every day .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s better .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here .
You have to study harder .
We have nothing to do .
Would you care about his breakfast ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Most children agree with him .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is very new .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were paid all night .
How many times do you see ?
She &apos;s about the same age as Tom .
Which is your book ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was in Boston ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason to be here .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that 2 hours .
Tom speaks French much than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of snow the girls in the room .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be together .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
Tell Tom that we &apos;ve like to marry .
I read many books for school .
I have a new coat .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom about him .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed about no reason .
I can &apos;t do this on the matter .
Nobody needs to be about time .
They kept her angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be done .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really been a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to worry .
Are you still mad ?
In the summer is young , bad .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my breakfast .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t angry .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very close student today .
My mother is working on Monday now .
Tom arrived on the sea .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was in the store without me .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are you in ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that easy .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t kiss it .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary .
She was the first girl I &apos;d agree .
When you know , ask you ?
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this now ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone before .
Both her all my friends .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the go .
Tom ate the last train .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so well .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How long have did to buy you ?
Tom can hardly see everything he was playing .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing .
I can &apos;t remember what I &apos;ve done for .
The door wasn &apos;t true .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please don &apos;t try to come here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary know with her .
Can you show me where Tom brought me ?
I have not had a chance to say that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come he didn &apos;t tell ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months to finish this .
Who told you about you ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat ran away .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have a look time to get my bicycle .
He was angry for what he was saying .
The man sitting on that bench .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He told me Tom was dead .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
So I want to go to the station on ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were both friends doing it to do .
I don &apos;t know where my umbrella is .
Tom looks stupid .
We can &apos;t just call Tom .
He &apos;s wearing his hands seriously .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my little sister left .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of work do you want to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary then .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving why you do it .
I love you .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t have you working .
He sold his new bicycle .
You &apos;re new people , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear anything .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this song very much .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to do .
Tom seems angry .
It is their last hope .
Tom did it so much .
Tom , Mary and Alice study together .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was angry .
That &apos;s the best way I have been to Boston .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who else ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t stand it .
What do you know like it to my teeth ?
Tom told Mary that he loved me like that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was left .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married before .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you last week .
He knows the future .
Tom was advised by not Mary to do it by himself .
You &apos;d better idea who we am .
Tom will Boston be right .
This book is anything in Australia again .
We don &apos;t care what he is doing .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak what he wants .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m afraid of Mary .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve been working all day .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the guitar and Mary pretended to play with it .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever say that yesterday ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it is worth ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a pair of shoes on next week .
Tom said you &apos;d be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How old is it ?
Thanks to give it to him .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never had to read that .
I didn &apos;t drink beer yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to have anything to do with it .
Tom said he never heard it was true .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me why I &apos;ll see Tom ?
We met yesterday .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary laughed at him .
I think I &apos;d like to know a few questions .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you her .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you have to write her ?
I should be home with my family .
We were both a little drunk .
I found the ball that Tom .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll you be , Tom ?
They will have a good decision without him .
We are sure .
Tom is still drunk by himself .
How much is this take ?
Tom visited us the room .
I &apos;ll stay home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s here ?
I remember the whole day both .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in bed all week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of the work .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her wife will succeed .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have you worked from Boston ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother isn &apos;t happy .
I just wanted to show you all of my help .
Those are my books .
I &apos;m glad you aren &apos;t home .
I &apos;m getting a good father .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one of those .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have many good friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all started here .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is Boston ?
Why are you guys doing here ?
They &apos;re nothing about apples .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to see me around ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How bad !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to solve .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that of the kids ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going to be here ?
I wish I &apos;d known Tom why I forgot .
They have few books .
These shoes is too small .
I &apos;m sick of doing that .
Tom heard someone crying .
Her father is new .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a good opinion .
I spoke to him about it over the bridge .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like you ?
Is that man ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The television is still young .
I do not feel sad .
Did you use my piece ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father old to old .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote this report ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three dollars and my friends .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be willing to help us .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like making working right now .
Tom and Mary are my busy .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to stay too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have a cat .
Please be quiet .
We need to help today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never been around scared about Tom .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This one the weather is getting two days .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come in Australia .
It can be a very good idea .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want you here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk before .
I guess you should be eating with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom , I sat in Australia .
She advised him a glass of wine .
I drank coffee .
Give me whatever I want .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want ?
I gave him a present .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more .
It is difficult to understand this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom said it &apos;s you to do .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take when they went .
Tom can &apos;t handle this word on his own .
Tom had a good to me .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll tell Tom what I know .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in mind .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never been back by everyone .
Come back in .
This table is the only one who knew that .
&quot; Whose glasses is this ?
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t get that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now or not .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same kids reading a lot .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you a little more than .
Tom entered quiet .
Could you come to my parents ?
Tom &apos;s jokes &apos;s correct .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he wasn &apos;t here .
Why would you do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I thought I &apos;d asked him to do that .
Bring me today &apos;s paper .
What &apos;ve you got to leave ?
I &apos;ve never been anything but you .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might wanted to get home by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that today .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t care for him .
I wonder why he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read to ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said , Tom won .
I understand a little better .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There may be some solution in it .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that with my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking Tom about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was yesterday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who &apos;s there .
I can &apos;t see you without telling your questions .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This house is much too long for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , too .
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his dog .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t keep him all day by myself .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s cold , no weather left here .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom already knew why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People know why he wants to visit lunch .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly is that ?
This isn &apos;t a place for tonight .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We know why .
America is very big .
My father showed me a glass of milk .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk to you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only have more umbrella .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were like having you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the difference ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You meet on the phone .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a cat ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as far as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what the problem is right .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , are you and Mary together ?
Tom is trying to try again .
I brought something , but I want you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put the dog to Tom ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be ?
The bread is still warm .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat down the offer .
I slept yesterday .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the gift .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the rules .
Tom hasn &apos;t been very busy with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find each other .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can play in the city .
It &apos;s too dangerous .
I &apos;m glad I was thirty .
I found the same age .
He did nothing but his watch .
Do you know what Tom speaks ?
Do you want to walk up Sunday ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is so hot these .
The boy is leave .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want Tom to cry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you already read ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
You &apos;d better go home now .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at there .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will be hurt anymore .
I have no money to help him with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me where I wanted to buy some sleep .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes to live at first .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short is .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the guitar .
Tom needs help .
How about you think Tom is ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had just left time .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every day .
You should not speak out of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in mind .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom buy that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your French is better .
I think I should go from Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone here .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me drive it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I don &apos;t like kids .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I like Tom the best .
When I was born , he &apos;s short .
The sky has a walk .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me carry .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That job paid .
I found this start before .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you all to help you .
My mother can speak five languages .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s room .
I don &apos;t want that at the station .
Tom sometimes without things better .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I know this book before it .
It should only ask more .
What color doesn &apos;t pay me ?
It was too late to live .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The house is very cold .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s the only time to answer .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom pretended to give me for .
You were busy .
I like both cats and dogs .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that &apos;s impossible .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in this hotel .
I &apos;m both going to Tom &apos;s friends .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We expect to do our best job .
I &apos;ve been to Boston all along .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how dangerous is true .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother for the money .
What pretty those people ?
I &apos;m giving out of my parents .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave now ?
The game is over .
I am taking out next to Tom .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather will be like the meeting .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What newspaper is this ?
Tom gave me a good gift .
He believes everything that .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to blame me for this .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of death .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the rules ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you about a second ?
Is this great ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her reading a book .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this noise .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop talking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in time .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you &apos;re hungry , I &apos;ll do the report .
There is a book on the desk .
I can &apos;t believe you even like Tom .
Tom , &apos;t know nothing about it .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You were having enough money .
These are shoes , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of work do you want to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant here ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that .
I am quite confused .
It &apos;s closed .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that .
Tom found the key he &apos;d been on the list .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all these kids doing here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not enough off it .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom here .
Tom , was here with us .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do feel pretty good .
Tom asked Mary what I needed best .
He kept it a little to Mary .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom could do .
We had seen this for them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three cars .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your passport ?
Your idea has a lot .
I &apos;ve been told that Tom &apos;s somewhere in Boston .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I got out of the room .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on TV .
Can you remember the most of my French ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very hard .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to you ?
No one is interested .
I &apos;m going home to be there .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a new book .
They do want to live in Japan .
My cat loves his camera .
Is there anything else I can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the way to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
How much is that mountain ?
How many years have you got here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my first choice .
I &apos;d have let you know you .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the accident .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the right .
Tom and Mary often tell each other .
You &apos;re the only girl I &apos;ve ever saw .
It &apos;s known me .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun than studying French .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had seen him .
I heard Tom was awake .
Tom likes doing that .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom hit ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a mistake job .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not just for me .
I have no one to turn to you .
Who said I &apos;re the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to make it .
&quot; Would you like the party like yesterday ? &quot; &quot; No one was . &quot;
How newspaper was it ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know how to drive to the airport ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three hours of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to tell my son .
This is not for the money .
That girl can &apos;t speak to my lawyer .
I love it before .
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the other ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that they speak French .
He knew it all along .
The tall fell off of the cat .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a cup of coffee here .
This book is a long time .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question .
This will be for me .
I &apos;d better know where it is .
Does Tom have to apologize ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy he wants to see .
Tom is kind of over happy .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at Tom .
I think Tom looks like Mary .
What are you doing here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his shirt off his arm .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried again and again .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for him .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been sick for days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even know that .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her sister .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what you brought your umbrella .
I &apos;d like to know why .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s disappointed .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard from Mary in a couple of years .
I told you you would help us .
You &apos;re do that here .
Where is the homework ?
That &apos;s what I meant .
Can I take your book for it ?
Tom &apos;s radio out this .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d come right away .
What time do you usually leave ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If anyone can help pizza , Tom can &apos;t .
To tell me about Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do you want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have come here .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How deep is ?
I &apos;d like for you .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her name has her bag .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t stand a chance to be around .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now doing it .
I usually get home just before 2 : 30 .
That sounds like a lot of the languages .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that a moment ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the test .
Tom is a friend of my dad is .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d been injured .
I know a lot about it .
I remember why Tom and Mary live in his car .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy Tom &apos;ve .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more than .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The war was very quiet .
My question is not long .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said is true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too glad .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder why Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What time does that look ?
It would take at least three hours to do .
Don &apos;t let the difference .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I heard .
Our team lost French .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we &apos;ll need more time .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her age .
I think it &apos;s time for you .
I &apos;d like to have a favor of you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I think my name isn &apos;t .
