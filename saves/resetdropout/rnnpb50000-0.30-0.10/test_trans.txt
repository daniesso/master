Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I wanted to do .
I don &apos;t know who was to say anything .
I think it &apos;s better wrong .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve just known Tom , but I don &apos;t remember Tom .
Is he going to make it ?
That is necessary !
Tom and Mary both looked talking to John .
The story is very difficult to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s just clear my way .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told Mary Mary died next year .
They are proud of fun .
It looks like you to make it a long time .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t have Tom who can help that .
He looks tired to see this tomorrow .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call people ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t even know how to swim .
There are two children in the sea .
He is absent from school tomorrow .
Tom never asked anyone .
We &apos;d be happy to help you .
I won &apos;t see her .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the whole bike to you .
Tom would &apos;ve been expecting you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t you go to me ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that guitar .
The meeting was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any of it .
Tom sat isn &apos;t the one one today .
It almost started raining .
I love my shoes and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that were all easy .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your friend .
Tom looked angry .
The town under the table .
I think they &apos;re good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s read a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem is Tom .
She refused our future .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows that .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would be of thirty .
Tom smiled at Mary and she laughed .
You read too much .
All of them sing very well .
Tom said that you call you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem right away .
Tom took his suitcase to work .
I usually eat every day .
What are you going as ?
There &apos;s very good news .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you were here .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was in time for our help .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes them better than coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now on time .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your father .
Tom and Mary were often scared of it .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it true ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
Tom began our to Boston .
What do you think of happened ?
Some of us have to finish this coffee .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the car .
He could not seem good already .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake number .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may sleep here .
Tom looked like .
Will you tell me this ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t come so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came there to hear Tom .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning to do that for you .
I bought a bike .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like breakfast without sugar .
He is hungry .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s problem .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this evening .
Tell Tom he wants to do that .
Tom asked Mary to close him .
I think Tom will never become famous .
You were all there , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was surprised that I knew .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll do it .
I am leaving in ten minutes .
What he said he thought to be nervous .
When should I walk ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also taking this book .
Do you really want to stay here for a drink ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary took it new .
We almost had Tom worked .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry around around early .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going to leave .
Tom and Mary live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looked like Tom and Mary loved John .
I &apos;d do not talk with you .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find me ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house .
That &apos;s not my car .
That makes me funny .
You &apos;re really good at .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve arrived here .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want to do that ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could could drink every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud to show you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what he is .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you speaking French ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How is your pencil ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that about that .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the way ?
It was a cold today .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is one one loves me .
I promised Tom to look after you .
The are going to be the beach today .
I &apos;ve been too busy today .
This has been difficult for the world .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom just speaks fast .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Have you finished these ?
I know .
Those are from Tom .
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What do we have to say ?
I &apos;m not even sure who that right .
My father never wrote me the letter .
I &apos;m as happy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that boy .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t watching the list .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known that , I would have told her .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really stupid .
A teacher is older than a prison .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played tennis yesterday .
Tom died next year in prison .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat lives by the river .
Who was here ?
There is somebody you loved .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there .
He called her .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom expect to eat with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised to do .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I played tennis after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him to help .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are doing .
You were waiting , and I love him .
How come on Boston ?
Give me three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom hurt ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is everybody so difficult ?
The boy is sick for homework .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is too tired .
I just can &apos;t do that to Tom .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is work from here .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody afraid .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses anymore .
I put the guitar on my desk .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by their voice .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really tired that Tom isn &apos;t there .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a voice .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s brother ?
Tom plays the piano .
What does Tom like to do that ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak not to meet him in the party .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like baseball .
I think you &apos;re fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is in Australia .
You can eat anything like you .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do we look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can &apos;t do that .
You speak French as well as you could .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the hospital .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s that the key ?
Tom and Mary seem to be mad .
You can help your own .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll ask you one before .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t buy it on time .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you show me that ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This apple is too small for me to be .
Do you really want to go to Boston ?
We &apos;re not expecting out in Boston .
He took off what he had left .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped my old room .
I only have two children .
Don &apos;t talk here to you , Tom &apos;s a good mood .
I can &apos;t leave now .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys about to talk to Tom ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he will come .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the sentence .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Ask me what you want him to drive him .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no one idea .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could take the train .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents here ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the wall .
I was thinking about it .
When did you eat ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it all the way to convince it .
How was over over over ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me shut .
What &apos;s that your wearing ?
It &apos;s important that my father is easy .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your bike ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the key ?
You aren &apos;t very satisfied .
Tom hardly ate anything like that .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another hair ?
I plan to walk guitar .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll be coming .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems nervous .
I &apos;m always good for you .
They enjoy their country .
The bicycle was fast .
Give me a light .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You are someone &apos;s better .
Tom is talking at his work .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like them .
I wonder if I should answer the letter .
We can &apos;t be sure of Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door .
Can you tell me anything to do that ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you both awake ?
Tom asked Mary if she was really busy .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are seldom named me .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will you bring to help us tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go .
I still haven &apos;t finished this .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two clothes ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we take them here ?
Tom hasn &apos;t called yet .
What &apos;re you doing , Tom ?
What &apos;s Tom &apos;s hat ?
Tom is good at writing .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to sleep just in time .
Tom went home .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as tall as tall as Mary .
If I &apos;d thought of it , I would &apos;ve bought it for you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been to Boston without this .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting in the hospital .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to talk to you .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
How did you expect such a thing ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t going to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t be .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
You can &apos;t let Tom hurt .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said he &apos;s ready .
The girl did not quit laughing .
You gave Tom that money , didn &apos;t he ?
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to me anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him .
I haven &apos;t made that word .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a computer .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his eyes .
Tom still lives with his wife .
Are you asking me for something ?
They were all the same .
She did not stay long .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s healthy .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you this do this ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can &apos;t understand you talking with you .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom could do it if he hadn &apos;t done that .
This we can do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not exactly as Tom .
I just wanted to thank you for .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years older than Mary .
He will soon are a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very large country .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just want to ask someone , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re older than I expected .
Tom &apos;s happy with Mary .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the truth sooner or later .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good sister .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is up there , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a seat .
I will take you on the book .
What a nice idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember Mary anymore .
The cats are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why do I want to do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis there .
Don &apos;t say that word anything .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough water .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I would do something .
It turned here .
There &apos;s hardly even any friends left .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you have to do this .
We got married very much .
Tom passed away all three years ago .
He lied to him .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to see this better .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to help you .
I am ready .
I have a little milk .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How is Boston ?
She will leave the work alone .
I &apos;m just finished all day .
He &apos;s just met his father .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a car .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you read ?
It was too easy .
Who is about Tom ?
I &apos;m told Tom that he needs to study French .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not new .
You don &apos;t have to work so long .
Your work is healthy .
Tom sat under a tree .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re better at it .
Can &apos;t any change ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always necessary .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran to his office .
I don &apos;t have a lot of work to do that .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times did Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea on coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that hat ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there before .
It would be fun if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as he used to .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many books did you learn ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too small .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom is right , I wouldn &apos;t go .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to open the window , didn &apos;t it ?
Why did you learn that ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to fire .
Put out that anyone .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to know ?
I wish I was dead .
Can someone ever talk about me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t likely to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of the problem .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , but he used to .
Tom can &apos;t be as he used to .
I never found doing that .
I don &apos;t drive hit .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t talk to Tom .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is your name .
Tom loves going to .
They were afraid .
She wrote some money to her dog .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the station .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked with them .
What makes you just Tom ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi now .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As everybody and I are happy .
What does Tom eat in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good idea .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was never trying to remember .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Tom ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t seem to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
It &apos;s nice , too .
I think we want more , can &apos;t you ?
Can you do it ?
I am a good friend .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are still dead .
What is the difference between this ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even all three times in his car .
He did what I wanted .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you need me .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That man knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an umbrella .
We weren &apos;t brothers .
Leave them alone .
Is there any in the room ?
It &apos;ll be white .
I play piano .
I have to have anything to eat today .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get any longer than I could .
It looks great .
When I was home at the airport .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t much one else .
I really shouldn &apos;t understand Tom .
He started a new life .
They play every night .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book was small last year .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both gotten very impressed .
Did that you know ?
It isn &apos;t enough .
Take the bus .
I have only one thing you do .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to apologize .
You &apos;re always coming to Boston .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to talk to Mary .
I &apos;ve got stolen one at the party .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your time .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of him .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me my wife .
This is our lucky .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not yesterday that I couldn &apos;t study with this .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book is good .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll be a long time for me .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve already been around that .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t sleep when I was .
I do not like this song .
So as helped you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t watch those .
It looks like to make a decision .
This is very good for school .
What are your plans for today ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is no longer time .
I want to talk to you about .
I like the way you walk .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
&quot; Do you think he didn &apos;t win ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all on your office .
Do you want me to give you a car ?
I feel so sure of him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come .
Tom wants to buy a lot of you .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost later .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s already done .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here .
You have to study hard .
We have things to do .
Would you usually writing a tie or coffee ?
I think that Tom speaks French .
Thank you for coming to Boston .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Most people came later .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were up all night studying French .
How many times do you know ?
She &apos;s about my way .
Which is one suit ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married pictures ?
I &apos;ve got a little good friends .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it later .
I don &apos;t want to play this with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to save the door .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report by tomorrow .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t know you the truth .
A lot of things is very cute .
Tom knew that Mary might be very hungry .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The room was small .
I read books that book .
I have a head early .
They know their situation .
I asked Tom and Mary can &apos;t speak French .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the concert with this .
I just have to study French .
They won &apos;t come .
Where can I buy bread ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All people are like he works .
I &apos;m already drunk .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to talk with Tom .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really enjoy it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you as much .
His son is five years old .
You don &apos;t need to say that again .
Are you still mad ?
Have you finished the town ?
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t found their homework .
Tom asked us to wait .
Tom is a father from Australia .
My mother is finally waiting to do it .
Tom makes it up .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was just how Tom would do it .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
Tom just started that .
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that way on here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he wanted to buy some help .
You were here for just about that .
He didn &apos;t keep his mind alone .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary .
She was the first guy I saw that .
When you know , please like it .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I have to go to Boston ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that in a bad idea .
Both things are !
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the car .
Tom ate the answer yesterday .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to help all well .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I ask you to ask you ?
Tom did everything .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come for something .
Tom seems like much better .
I can &apos;t hear what I asked him .
The door wasn &apos;t in prison .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not OK with me .
Tom should &apos;ve helped it again .
Can you show me at the hotel ?
I have not no longer time to see that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something wrong .
How did you have an umbrella ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than me .
Who told you what you think ?
There is no doubt that he &apos;s honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My father came back and see you .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have the same word to you .
He stood up for about .
The man sat on on the street .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry an apple .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Do you want to know that , don &apos;t you ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were a teacher .
I don &apos;t know where my father is .
Tom looks good .
We can &apos;t just leave Tom .
He &apos;s wearing glasses .
I &apos;m used to play alone .
Today is my beautiful sister .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of person do you like ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to hear Mary wasn &apos;t there .
Tom lived in Australia about three years .
I &apos;m not leaving for you all .
I love you guys way .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they in ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , don &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t have you happy .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to speak outside .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve heard that Tom &apos;s daughter .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to know Mary was really rich .
Tom seems angry .
It is one .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom is working to do with that computer .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do now .
He made to leave .
Tom didn &apos;t want to sleep .
That &apos;s the answer what you &apos;ve been been to the hospital .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to be late for time ?
Tom told me that he might be interested in .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is almost tall .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the movie .
Tom was never to tell the truth yesterday .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will always be safe .
This book is already knows anything .
We don &apos;t care .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long have you known ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can you ?
Tell Tom I &apos;m there .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have bad news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom died the room .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom called something ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it means ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a message for Mary .
Tom said you might be able to help us .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How old is it ?
Thanks to show you something .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to finish it for me .
I never meant to change you alone .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what to do with me .
Tom seemed to be expecting it on the bus .
Can your wife speak French ?
Can you tell me what Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary yet .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her eyes .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I said .
Isn &apos;t Tom scared ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that .
I can &apos;t say anything at this .
Why do you have to take it ?
I should be home .
We were both a bit nervous .
I found the money that Tom had lied .
Tom is almost six friend .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They can &apos;t have any other each other .
We are calling the truth .
Tom and Mary are brothers together .
How much is this worth ?
Tom visited Australia this week .
I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the whole day of my life .
I &apos;d like to have a cup of coffee .
Tom has been sick in bed for a few days .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for asking me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom &apos;s going to have dinner .
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of it .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son is known for him .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary all ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother will always be rich .
I just wanted to talk to you all right .
Those are my sister &apos;s .
I &apos;m glad you guys !
I &apos;ve only been a Canadian .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very good .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have everything but tell her .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether Mary loved Mary .
I &apos;ve got a job .
The baby is fast .
The car is ready .
It all lives in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What happens in Boston in Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost off .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you &apos;ve been married ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was here .
Try to understand me .
It appears there !
I don &apos;t want to hear another one .
Where would you like to go ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got more to stop .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s everybody at the room ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d feel bored .
They have few books .
These shoes are hard .
I &apos;m sick .
Tom heard someone laugh .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke about her now .
You &apos;re old enough .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that sweet ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The house is not young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my passport ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?
Tom nearly died .
My father became bad .
Tom has a lot of work .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote that one ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your hand ?
Tom gave Mary his money and she .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said he was happy .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me to talk to me .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have only a dog .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never seen Tom as much as Tom as Tom .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This is the village where we walk last year .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember and look in Australia .
It can &apos;t be sure .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who told me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen her husband before .
I guess you won &apos;t be eating with us .
The fire is out .
I can &apos;t walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve felt sad .
Tom , are you ?
She advised him where he were .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want here ?
I gave him a lot .
I think we &apos;re better .
I wish Tom were more more .
It is difficult to understand this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have some money .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The bus is ten minutes away .
Tom can &apos;t help Mary now .
Tom had a chance to finish it .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a dictionary , I &apos;m happy .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never read what happened .
Come back in .
This table is the same time that .
&quot; he &apos;s supposed to come to Tom .
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now looks like a father .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same color as Tom .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a little favor .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come for my idea ?
Tom &apos;s sound younger .
Tom hardly likes us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a knife , aren &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would you do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in Japan .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve worked for a long time .
At first .
Bring me this box , OK .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never written more money in you .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might go home by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read a book ?
I can &apos;t see why you &apos;m here .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He was late today .
I understand out a little .
She wasn &apos;t leaving her .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There may be some possible .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that one .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this hotel .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be hurt tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that car ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the school today .
I can &apos;t see you again .
I &apos;m going to stay here for dinner .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This dress is too much for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is tall , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy her .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your face .
I thought I wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t sleep long enough .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s happening again .
It &apos;s not to lend me a cup of coffee .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why Mary wants to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to church by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a day for you .
I &apos;ll be busy tomorrow afternoon .
We don &apos;t know why .
Stop around here .
My father drinks a cup of coffee every morning .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m here from Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only has one tie .
Tom can &apos;t sleep almost as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really confused .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s that , isn &apos;t it ?
This problem is difficult to solve .
How was the weather ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the money .
I had time all time .
What are you guys here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a computer ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t look as much older than Mary .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did exactly better than the truth .
Come with me .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom is up to let us drive , please .
Tom is said he was in trouble , would she &apos;s ?
I brought something that I want to show you .
Tom seems afraid .
Tom has always loved Mary .
Tom had things not to say that himself .
Did you put Tom up to Tom ?
Tom told me that he was strong .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The food is also warm .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept yesterday .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read without us .
I &apos;m the last one here .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be alive .
This must be the game .
Tom hasn &apos;t expected a word after you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can tell the truth .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I did it .
I found the house .
He did whatever she worked in Japan .
Do you know what Tom went shopping ?
Do you want to be free here ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is not very large .
The boy &apos;s mine .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining .
I don &apos;t want my mother to make up .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the truth .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you ever seen him already eaten ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go outside .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at .
I don &apos;t want to go alone .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help you again .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me if I had drunk .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , and Mary ?
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t afraid yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the piano is Tom .
Tom needs help now .
How much of Tom did that ?
When does Tom want to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a few years .
I wish you had called with it movie .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the movies .
I do that before .
You should not speak out of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been for thirty minutes .
We were just going home .
Tom didn &apos;t usually know why .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I just tell Tom that you were here .
I think I should be alone .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s good for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the city .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat that .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to you about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I lost !
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We always agree with you .
I like to see the police .
When I returned home for his glasses .
The sky is not satisfied .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That suit quickly .
I found this picture of him .
Tom made that himself .
Tom thought there , I was at all , bad .
My mother had an accident .
Tom has to go to school early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says he likes it .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my real business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not going to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always see this day .
It was one for three years .
What color ago did you buy ?
It was a small one .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The only love it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for your sister .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to explain for you .
You were busy .
I like both dogs and other .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true , isn &apos;t it ?
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am happy to talk about it now .
I &apos;m only going to talk to Tom .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We had to do it .
I &apos;ve been to Boston either .
I know that you &apos;re here .
I don &apos;t care how white Tom .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother around here .
What makes those books ?
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The situation is over .
I am taking French next year .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea we &apos;ll be here tomorrow .
We &apos;re not not .
When you &apos;ve stayed with Tom .
What kind of bad ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that .
You should eat vegetables .
We had too much fun in Australia .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a good question .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the men doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk with you in a second ?
Is Tom in Australia ?
That doesn &apos;t really new money to me .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it to be done .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her study yesterday .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a hospital .
Tom and Mary are friends for John .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s very hot today .
If you !
There is a cat on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you just like your help .
Tom would like nothing more than to do .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You should decide every fast .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of person are you ?
Tom didn &apos;t need to help Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to be doing that .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a hospital ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that day .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s &apos;s Monday .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly ask Tom to do that .
Tom found the key he had been there .
Tom loved doing that .
What are these people doing here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not as well as it &apos;s .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the matter .
Tom , Mary and I were here again .
We &apos;ll be friends .
I do really feel good .
Tom asked Mary what she wanted .
He looked into his jokes .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom did .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just too busy .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three friends .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I think that he will come .
He came back home .
May I ask me a favor ?
Your idea is very good .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you know what you have ?
I want to drink some water .
This is my best news .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my own .
Can you remember the concert ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very open .
You do want with you , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to say to me ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to be there .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that morning .
Was Tom likes to swim ?
My father loves money .
Is there anything else we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the kind of for you .
Tom will take care of everything .
If necessary , it &apos;s important for you to make it .
How did you find Christmas ?
Is it Tom &apos;s computer ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really love Tom .
I &apos;d have told you everything I &apos;ve done .
I can &apos;t talk with this now .
This is where the accident .
Have you told Tom why you were here ?
I found the key I made .
Tom and Mary swim together .
You &apos;re the woman I &apos;m there .
It &apos;s up Tom .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun left alive .
Tom didn &apos;t want to see Mary very well .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually say ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a good job .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not going to rain that evening .
I have no one to help you .
Who told Tom that ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Have his husband yet ?
How fast did you study ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know who &apos;s the one ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three books .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do and marry them .
If you don &apos;t want to talk about it , you don &apos;t need to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to do a new pair of shoes reading .
This man is very , very .
That wasn &apos;t easy .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s children .
Look at Tom .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that that girl lied .
He knew it all along .
The tall man is out of the room .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a hat to do this .
This book is famous enough to read .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve done .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question .
This bike &apos;s too expensive .
I &apos;d better take a word .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very careful . I &apos;m working at all .
Tom is kind of home .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like that .
What are you doing here yesterday ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t want it to be a good job .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his room and put them on purpose of himself .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried to pay for me , but I couldn &apos;t cry .
That &apos;s a knife .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a family .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my soup .
My mother has been sick for two hours .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even know what I need to say .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows how it works .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you said to .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you want to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s look all the whole day .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t played French for a long time .
I told you to help us on purpose .
You &apos;re actually scared !
Where is the TV ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your look for it ?
Tom &apos;s class raised his car .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wonder whether Tom &apos;s birthday .
What do you want to leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom .
If anyone can help us .
To tell you the truth , but I don &apos;t like it .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the problem to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get done .
I don &apos;t have a pain in this room .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How come they are ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go shopping .
Her son has known her .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You are three years ago .
French is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home in bed .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the newspaper .
Tom is a teacher at French .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only know what &apos;s one of them .
Tom bought a lot of books .
I know how busy you &apos;ve done .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he thought Mary needs help .
I don &apos;t know what would do that .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They won &apos;t find someone .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
You &apos;re too beautiful at school .
My life is quite nervous .
How will I find it ?
Go out out .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good friends for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough water .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way right now .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to say .
Tom is my wife .
I wonder how Tom did that .
Tom has been fired .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What do we feel called ?
It doesn &apos;t look at us .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I thought .
Leave she hurt .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a baby .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher loves her .
I think it &apos;s too difficult for me a day .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my daughter missing .
