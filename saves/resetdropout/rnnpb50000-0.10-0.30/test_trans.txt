Be nice to her .
How come you enjoy so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to do with you .
I can &apos;t think of that I was planning on .
I think it &apos;s better to know that .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked very busy for Tom and Mary .
Is he going to be happy ?
That !
Tom and Mary both know where to swim .
The story is very simple to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so dark the shop .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary &apos;s out .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like we need to see it a day .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call early ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you would &apos;ve been married .
There are two books under there .
He will arrive in Australia tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you did it for us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to be here alone .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have a house French .
Tom would &apos;ve been waiting for you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s house ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m now .
I know Tom does that .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any sure about it .
Tom sat on the table from this village .
It suddenly started started .
I love my brothers and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of shoes .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very good .
I found your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to do this .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman driving the law is mine .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually say anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try to do this ?
I just want to carry this hand .
I have never done this .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the kitchen .
The cat is sleeping on the time .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows things wrong .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t watch TV .
That would take about one .
Tom smiled at Mary and Alice again .
You read too much .
All of wine under the piano .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem that you don &apos;t see .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat less than a problem .
What are you going as long ?
There &apos;s very little milk .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He stopped yet , but he &apos;s younger .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea better than you .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now to leave now .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your bill .
Tom and Mary played together almost all day .
Do I have to go to the post office ?
Everything is gone .
Is it cold just here ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A policeman dog it &apos;s over .
What do you think is wrong ?
Some people have to work with work .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand as many people as bad as possible .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake everything .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your seat here .
Tom looked like he was happy .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to the airport to ask me for money .
No one knows his story .
I &apos;m learning so much today .
I bought a camera off myself .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like studying English because &quot;
He is scared of others .
I have many problems to do .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s happy .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom to pay he .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never become famous .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would never know the truth .
I was able to find an grandmother .
How are you doing ?
I know this is easy .
When you come to be right , I &apos;m right .
I am leaving at now .
What he said he was sick .
When should I become the radio ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also taking this train .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom promised to want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom convinced .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , please .
It looked like Tom wanted to say more , but I didn &apos;t .
I &apos;d like come with you .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk with Tom .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom knew it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really too old .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could swim faster every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom could understand all Tom ?
I understand that Tom does that .
I looked surprised Tom does .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a fine day !
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big tree .
I promised Tom I &apos;d help you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out .
This has been good for your answer .
I think I understood .
The man is Japanese .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle &apos;s license .
Tom got very worried when he was sad .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put something to your mother ?
I know .
Those are men , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say to look in the rain ?
I &apos;m not sure if I told you that .
My father gave me the letter .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in us .
Let &apos;s go on my family .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary sometimes work together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of Tom are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
I wish I had known that I knew you were happy .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is stolen .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat was broken .
Who was here ?
Why &apos;re you asking Tom ?
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a dream .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called me every day that .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring it ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised you to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where you &apos;re going .
You were worried , but I don &apos;t know .
How a big baby ?
Give that much .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life so difficult ?
The park is short of children .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of my dog .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all morning .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The problem is ten minutes after ten years .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses seriously .
I own have a man .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by him .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really young .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter who &apos;s rich .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this your room &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano at all .
What does Tom like to do that ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak not better than English .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can help me .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that accident ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you more than anything .
Did Tom say what happened ?
I know them .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s looking .
I didn &apos;t leave when it was too late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This watch should be warm .
Do you really want to go to Boston ?
We &apos;re not exactly in this bad and mine .
He managed to buy what she did .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the door open .
I only have two children .
This book is all that I think I was here .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to say with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he had nothing to get .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll phone Tom after you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys talking to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he was sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way Mary was .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who can speak French well .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no food in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could rain .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s son .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the wall .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you think of that house ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had to do with the matter .
How was today &apos;s today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me work .
What &apos;s that your suitcase ?
It &apos;s important for me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive Tom .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the truth ?
You aren &apos;t going French .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave until day long night .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll drive the house .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m pretty glad you &apos;re my friend .
They enjoyed school the letter .
The baby seems to be white .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two are really kind .
Tom is talking for his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should telephone money .
We can &apos;t be sure of what to do .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you both crazy ?
Tom asked Mary very pretty happy .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are good to be around .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me happy with Tom .
I still enjoyed .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two years ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French ?
Why don &apos;t we tell me anything about it ?
Tom hasn &apos;t invited yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happened to Tom ?
Tom is good at doing .
Let me drive you .
I &apos;m coming to see you .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do ?
Tom isn &apos;t as rich as Mary is .
If you &apos;d asked me for it , I would have out it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that it was possible .
We &apos;ve been asked to Tom , Tom .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help that , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
How did you come doing that in such a long time ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom isn &apos;t here .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be going to say something .
We miss you .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said we were right back .
The little girl said not laugh .
You gave Tom the money he asked .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom said it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream won &apos;t true .
Tom closed his apartment and fell asleep .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for something ?
They all look the same .
She did nothing was her chance .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s your enemy .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be time tomorrow ?
We were studying French .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about me .
I can see you so much .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is warm .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see Tom again .
Tom could do it .
This &apos;ll hurry .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not convinced what I was of old .
I just wanted to say thank you .
We have a big dog .
How was work ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very good house .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll see you .
You just saw Tom , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all understand .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the truth again .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good opinion to study abroad .
Where did you leave your eyes ?
It is supposed to rain today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a while .
What a nice !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The boy is in the piano .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why isn &apos;t that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that again again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I want to do .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly anything to happen .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what we do , you do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to call this moment .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I am ready .
I have this apple .
Who will we go on ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital before .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just a shy .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see you .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many times have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom yesterday , too ?
I &apos;m looking for someone &apos;s age .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not crazy .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children are healthy .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three days .
Can we come ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s not been .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom told me ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or not ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you buy that shirt ?
They don &apos;t speak French .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any food .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you know .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many flowers weren &apos;t there ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did it .
It &apos;s too beautiful .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get to tell you what I want .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to open it on the street .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that movie .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d want to tell you ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you tell me where Tom is ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear to work , but he has a brother .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably don &apos;t like Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to college .
They were afraid .
She can do it to her back .
How do you know I &apos;m not going ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the station .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you just told Tom that Tom was your first way to dance ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As we finished yet , but I know either .
What does Tom see about you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about you ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to live in the street .
These people are both my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
Mary and Mary seem very tired of the plan , so he .
I think you have something else to eat next weekend .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary isn &apos;t here .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference between this and ?
I &apos;m not hungry .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even at his age , he isn &apos;t here .
He did what he said , too .
You have to write as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That is exactly &apos;s .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t expecting people help .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three weeks .
I play piano .
I have not anything to eat until this morning .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license .
Tom and Mary just see that .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I know .
It looks great .
When I came to my house , my house ?
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s that that ?
There isn &apos;t much noise left .
I really should &apos;ve listened to Tom .
He started a new life .
Go at the door .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought that Mary might have to stay in Boston .
The book I bought was very small .

What time is Boston in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost as well as we can .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .

That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How big flowers ?
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?

Here &apos;s your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d like him it .
They have many books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .

I want a question who can speak French .
I spoke to him about the gift .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like you ?

Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .

Who and Tom got taken ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk before .
I guess you can &apos;t stand with us .
The beach is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom , where are where we are .
She advised him to stay .
I drank coffee .

We just want to know what Tom is coming .
We &apos;ll find a solution .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never said to give it what needs to be .
Come back in .
This table is the same age as this .
&quot; What &apos;s your opinion to Tom ? &quot; &quot; No , thank you . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t solve that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now &apos;s never .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the time but Mary had .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a little bit .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the movies when Tom left the train ?
Tom &apos;s making tall weather .
Tom hardly ever talks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in his room and closed the door .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first and I don &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me around the desk , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never decided anything about it .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary was to Boston by herself .
Tom said he thought Mary might needed to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read the book ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said this morning , please .
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to Boston ?
There can &apos;t be to be a good mood .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that better than you .
Please do about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking Tom about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was a end .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this .
I can &apos;t see you in pain like this .
I &apos;m going to stay here for four days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This dress is very nice for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .

I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t swim well last night .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will be there .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .

Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows how to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a friend of you .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
Boston is a big house .
My father eats a lot of work .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time with you .

You leave , but I &apos;m not a good mood .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing out ?

She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .

Tom seems ready .
Tom has always loved to do that .
Tom had other money on his mind .
Did you call Tom up to it ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The room is full of order .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept television .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the city .
Tom thinks I should be safe .

Do you know what Tom can , ?
Do you want to be safe here ?
How long will you be here with us ?
The soup is so hot that I can &apos;t drink it .
The boy doesn &apos;t understand girls .
How often do you stay here ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason why Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you to study French ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as well as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about six .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better die .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me if I had left my mind stolen .
Isn &apos;t Tom good ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This happens is very hot .
Tom likes Mary and to tell Mary .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?

Tom needs help now .
I feel absolutely talking to you .
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had stopped in trouble .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak ill of others .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t written to Mary in weeks .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t intend to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope this doesn &apos;t need your help .
I think I should miss Boston .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .

Tom made that himself .
I thought you right , I think I understand .
My mother could speak French .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says he isn &apos;t stupid .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not true .
Here &apos;s what we want to do .
I never said this day .
It &apos;s just last month .
What car do you run ?
It was a different person .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bicycle .
The students is speaking French .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for it to read .
Tom lost his camera in the city .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I asked .
You were busy .
I feel like both young .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true .
I need to go to the doctor .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you in this town .
I &apos;m only going to say it one more time .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s it from ?
They might be older than you .
We prefer to have shoes .
I &apos;ve been to love often .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care what I &apos;ll come .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my back out .
What pretty flowers !
I &apos;m mad at both of you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The message is over .
I am taking with his car .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather will be here .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom , you &apos;ll understand .
What time is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything I say .
You should eat more .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to answer me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the brothers ?
Tom ate more .
Could I talk to you alone for a second ?
Is this real ?
That doesn &apos;t really help us , did it ?
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her friends a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the hospital .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are looking for Mary , John .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you &apos;d help me do that .
There is a cat on the floor .
I can &apos;t believe you ought to make Tom happy .
Tom did nothing else to tell Mary everything .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You have missed missed three days .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of one do you like to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a car ?
How much do you want to do ?
We didn &apos;t even get that far .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s today .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can &apos;t find Tom &apos;s boyfriend .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are these these people doing here ?
How far is it there to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not what I was in love today .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best we could .
Tom , Mary , John and John and Alice all kissed each other .
We &apos;ll be friends .
I do not drink .
Tom asked Mary what Mary has money .
He showed me no money .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing I can .
We had fun with Tom .
Can we use this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now they have three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back here .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea is going to be a good one .
I &apos;ve been doing that way today .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what Tom has brought his son .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the reason we watched that ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very shy .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have enough to say to me ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going home to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a glass of wine .
Many everyone can stop it alone .
My cat loves cats .
Is there anything you can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the one who told you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every day in this lake is different .
How long I I met you here before ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my first choice .
I &apos;d like you to call Tom .
I can &apos;t deal with this noise .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom already ?
I read one to have .
Tom and Mary often leave eye .
You &apos;re the best woman I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s having makes mistakes .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun than Christmas .
Tom didn &apos;t know about Mary well .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t work to school tomorrow .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a good family .
Tom has left the city .
It is not exactly Tom &apos;s fault .
I have no one to give you to .
Who said I say this ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Has she arrived yesterday , please ?
How fast were Tom ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to me , too .
Tom has three older than him .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go home .
I need to ask up a few more than usual .
This man is very old .
That girl has eaten a year .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s dog .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the people ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he loved him with him .
He knew it all along .
The big boy was sleeping yet .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a camera for this town .
This book is easy enough to carry .
I don &apos;t know what you can .
I like to speak music .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This work is for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind of being happy .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his pictures and write his name .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried on talking , but I didn &apos;t see him .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s one is there .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t seen John in a lawyer .
I told you Tom to help us .
You &apos;re the right idea .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom looks strong and dinner .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been born here .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary here in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I can &apos;t see Tom again .
If we can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
To tell you that I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have a party in this morning .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How a big baby ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should do Mary .
Her son has never stolen .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t blame up .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home as soon as possible .
That sounds like a lot of fun .
It &apos;s on the list .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that good ?
I &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the test .
Tom is a friend &apos;s my brother &apos;s .
Tom spoke to French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I wonder where Tom is as poor as his mother .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how old you must be .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he thought Mary had anything to do that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The problem is very small , but it &apos;s very expensive .
My guy is quite long .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was done .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s right younger than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boyfriend .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been drinking three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What time and I were leaving ?
It makes only of I have to do that .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;ve been asked .
Our team talking that .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor .
I can read read .
Our teacher died for her age .
I think it &apos;s time for me to call my homework .
I &apos;d like to have a man like this .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I feel happy .
