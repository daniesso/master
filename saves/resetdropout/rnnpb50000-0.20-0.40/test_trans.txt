Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do .
I can &apos;t think of anything I &apos;d like to you .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked at Tom for me .
Is he going to make it ?
That hurts !
Tom and Mary both know how to speak French .
The story is very easy to understand .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy here .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary died in Boston .
They are proud of his daughter .
It &apos;ll like you more time .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom sleep and I could stay ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning on doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to do .
There are only making waiting here .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy if you could come with us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the point where it was .
Tom would &apos;ve been better .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m money .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any of it .
Tom finished as far from me .
It suddenly started .
I love my parents and advice .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very happy .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The policeman advised the boy to the room .
I think things look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s fix something .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his apple .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the kitchen .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows what we &apos;re doing .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary .
You read too much .
Today of them walk .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem here there .
Tom took his mouth .
I usually eat bread .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very little wine .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was drinking .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea better than me coffee .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary played watching all day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always cold recently ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do it .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A son to my mother .
What do you think is going to have ?
Some of us have to work this weekend .
I have never seen sure like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not seen him so much .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake twice .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your bag here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my office to help me .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much from here .
I bought a camera ago .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking beer every day .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many problems to do .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will never speak French .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was able to catch the guitar .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , I &apos;ll go .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What he said was true , he wouldn &apos;t be true .
When should I do the car ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m taking the train .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s by there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can &apos;t you ?
It looked like Tom wouldn &apos;t say anything .
I &apos;d give Tom any advice .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really pretty , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve got Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it again ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s happening again .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom can &apos;t speak French ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How did Tom stay in your office ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a bad day .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it anymore .
There is a big house near the park .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach .
I &apos;d rather not go out .
This has been here to the bank .
I think I understood .
The man is white .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got that standing on the floor .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put in this ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say is not not true .
I &apos;m not sure if I want to read this book .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that movie .
Let &apos;s go into my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my daughter .
Tom was injured .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t getting along together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known you , you can do it .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is faster .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October last year .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat has Tom left .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who wants to meet you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He left this time .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom bring with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How everyone is cute ?
Give us three minutes .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is it difficult ?
The window is still .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very tall .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has lost a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The time is seeing but ten .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need dinner anymore .
I let the cat into an room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed over it .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really worried who Tom is .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter to a Canadian .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom happy to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak only French because of it .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he do that .
You speak French very little .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that company ?
Tom and Mary were very happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what Tom said ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive until he was late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This table has been a lot of advice .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not really going out of this this way .
He took up for her at his age .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the ball yesterday .
I only have two children .
If it we happens , we don &apos;t like it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new guitar .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those at him eat lunch together .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no clock in my room .
Tom was afraid to tell his parents .
That could read .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary &apos;s cute .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat fish lunch ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do .
How was today &apos;s great ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s your difference ?
It &apos;s important that you tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your eyes ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom again .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the children ?
You aren &apos;t like the truth .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to leave as soon as I finish it .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a bench .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I don &apos;t have my husband with me .
They enjoy another hotel again .
The light seemed to be impressed .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You actually got this kind .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not just like both of them .
I wonder if I should answer his question .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything else ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you even Japanese ?
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with it .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary want to be done .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot again tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me go with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you really want to come ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two OK ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we try where Tom is out about it ?
Tom hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What happens to me !
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy is walking .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as speaking French .
If you &apos;d asked me for it , I won &apos;t either .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that she was possible .
We &apos;ve been not to do this again .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one who can trust .
How did you come up with a good mood ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s birthday .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do that .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there has nothing else .
The little girl has gotten sick .
You gave Tom the money who needed to do that .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a cup of tea .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his eyes and closed .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for something ?
They all look the same .
She did us , but didn &apos;t stay with us .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this tomorrow ?
We were studying French .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can understand you anymore .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure that will happen .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This &apos;ll do we do .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never understand things .
I found this book very interesting .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m better than Tom .
I just wanted to say you .
We have a big dog .
How was work ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very beautiful tree .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw you , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I am .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice all like dancing .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll have happy here .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good interest to study abroad .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is supposed to be today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this , Tom .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a swim .
What a beautiful idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s house ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve done for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in that store .
It hurts .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you have , you have to be your mother .
We got Tom very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here no way .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to see me this time .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to marry you .
I am ready .
I have letters I don &apos;t have .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here because you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new car .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many children have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom , yet ?
I &apos;m sure that Tom likes to work .
It doesn &apos;t work here .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children look healthy .
Tom sat under the tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three hours .
Can &apos;t say anything ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s no secret .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with you .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like me .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that guitar ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too late .
How many boys have you come ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get the job , I &apos;ll tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to send it on the plan .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl ate to walk .
Put out that Tom .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell Tom ?
I wish I was dead .
Can somebody wait for me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , but he is .
Tom can &apos;t be much longer .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive Japanese .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to the movies .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy a picture of mine .
How do you know I &apos;m Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the hand .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked fine .
What makes you so much to me ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As soon as he comes over , you know .
What does Tom see in Mary ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to feel tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about John ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he came into the room , I went home .
I think what you need now is to eat .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary .
My parents are both dead .
What is the weather like this ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even though that he was mad .
He did what I wanted .
You have to begin soon .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a couple of .
That woman knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We was too busy yesterday .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three weeks .
I play piano .
I have not had anything to eat before this morning .
It &apos;s possible Tom &apos;s not here .
Tom and Mary like John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked .
It looks great .
When I came home , I was the first time .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that box ?
There isn &apos;t much difference .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That sometimes is very happy .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he &apos;d have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book was very cold .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary have been very drunk .
Your question is pretty much .
It isn &apos;t as if we were rich .
Take the kitchen .
I &apos;ve got this hard I need you to do that .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to be angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got work to do .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your baby OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only chance .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not until until that door again .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book was interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for dinner .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just lost the new news .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat pizza when I was a child .
I do not like this .
So where were you ?
I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care about sugar .
It looks as if it is going to rain .
This is not the church with I go .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I like the way you students .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
Does anyone live alone ?
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all right .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like telling him what I think of him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every evening .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s even hard .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here somewhere .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you give a speech about Australia ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to school .
He is proud of being a doctor .
Tom looked great .
Most children love children .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were up all night .
How many times do you think ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my friends .
Which did you read this ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get children when he was in Australia ?
I &apos;ve got no good sure Tom will like him .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once more .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that later .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of life did that true .
Tom knew that he &apos;d be very hungry by the time .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t so expensive .
I read several books last weekend .
I have a dog .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom and Mary had gotten married .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the doctor with this .
You wouldn &apos;t be able to go .
They broke angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really understand it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that funny .
Are you still mad ?
In the cake was beautiful .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary completely completely trust something .
Tom asked us to wait until Monday .
Tom is a very close to me .
My mother and I aren &apos;t right right now .
Tom has on making the same mistake .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom was lying .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that bad from here .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t return at it .
I can stay home .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary , but she didn &apos;t come to the dance .
She was the only girl who that .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this alone ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone anything like that before .
Both of her parents are dead .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the go .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom died to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I seen you ?
Tom can hardly wait without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing .
I can &apos;t remember what I could do .
The door wasn &apos;t open .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with you .
Can you show me where you pay ?
I have never had a chance to see that .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How come he didn &apos;t show me ?
It &apos;s going to win .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat got back and soon .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do not have the courage to ask them this .
He stood up for the joke .
The man sitting on the chair is with Tom .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry the night .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a computer ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Would you like to go , too ? &quot;
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary were sure what Mary did .
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just discuss it .
He &apos;s not much surprised to hear Mary .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my little younger than yours .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary at there .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you tell me everything .
I love you people .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for this .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new movie ?
We can &apos;t be you this .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new around here , aren &apos;t you ?
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve got this novel very much .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to hurt Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It is the last movie .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary will be alone .
Who spoke ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the best restaurant of him to .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to ask about this morning ?
Tom told me that he &apos;d be interested in that .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get the bird .
I was married once .
He is as tall as I am .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the lot well .
Tom was sitting on the couch by Mary .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will be happy .
This book is worth reading again and again .
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can &apos;t he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m children .
Why is I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have to stop you .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the guitar .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told anyone ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it means ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a couple of days ago .
Tom said you might be able to help you .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How old is it ?
Thanks it to you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never not to pay any of them .
I didn &apos;t drink from breakfast .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to want to do anything for me .
Tom said he decided it was too hard to do .
Can your baby know ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary at him .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you her .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you have only one ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit late .
I found the money that Tom had lost .
Tom is almost six feet tall .
Tom is new here .
Tom wanted you to know .
Tom bought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;ll it be , Tom ?
They will have eating eating tonight .
We are calling the police .
Tom is still out of the whole person of the world .
How much is this worth ?

I &apos;ll return home tomorrow .
Do you know where we are ?
Which are Tom &apos;s ?
I remember the day you were very nice .
I &apos;d like to have a glass of wine .
Tom has been sick in a car now .
Tom left town .
I want to see each other .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have your keys ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind Mary .
That must never happen .
Her son is crazy for advice .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary are married ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother always knows Tom &apos;s not coming .
I just wanted to try call with you .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you are all here .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on the bench in the park .
Take that one there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several good friends .
Tom has never been sick .

I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all still in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is Boston in Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost in great than we rest .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to speak when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How come !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do all the time .
What &apos;ll you die ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are you ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that building ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I &apos;m very busy all my parents .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The night is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my daughter ?

Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like studying here .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help us ?
I &apos;ve never know if I laugh as much as I eat .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the hotel where we arrived last month .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come at it .
It can &apos;t be as a teacher .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom before 2 : 30 .
I guess you won &apos;t win .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard Tom say .
Tom , where are we ?
She advised him where he was in Boston .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want me to do again ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were hungry .
It is difficult to understand this novel .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have more friends .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take New York next month .
Tom can &apos;t fix this by himself .
Tom had a chance to travel to Boston .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a place .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be a doctor .
Come back in .
This table is the same part .
Which train is it &apos;s ?
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s raining already .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same one many times .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a few questions .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to my office ?
Tom doesn &apos;t do exactly now .
Tom hardly speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would I do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in French and nobody .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me today &apos;s paper .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been anything but surprised with you .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might been married for dinner .
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their father .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read such a letter ?
I can &apos;t see why you don &apos;t want to do this .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He is taller than me .
I understand Japanese a little .
She wasn &apos;t helping her husband .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you &apos;re going to be here ?
There may be our great now .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that before ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this bicycle .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of your mother .
I &apos;m going to go home for meat .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a house .
This hat is not fat .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty .
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to do him for him .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about them .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t move right over last night .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s worth raining .
It &apos;s nice to you by moment .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom already gets here before .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to speak in French in school .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a decision .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father drinks a cup of coffee a cake .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break up tonight .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only has one dog .
Tom can swim faster than Mary .
Tom and Mary got really worried about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , right ?
This problem is difficult to solve .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You missed on the bus .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what most of never would be true .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , what will get with you alone , Tom ?
Tom is trying to answer by himself .
I brought something that I want to give you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put me up there ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The mail is still warm .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept eight hours .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can drive .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the case .
Tom hasn &apos;t been impressed with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well yet .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can &apos;t see the concert from here .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the building .
He did nothing almost watch all day .
Do you know what Tom eat for lunch ?
Do you want to hurry up here ?
How long do you be staying with us ?
The soup is so hot .
The boy doesn &apos;t believe me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother to lose .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t like him .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both ever could know you ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home soon .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at about each other .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary is doing that again .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any children .
He asked me whether I had been studying French .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , and I do he .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy the company is the building .
Tom needs help now .
How much your family do Tom ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had come .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that every week .
You should not speak French .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been in bad .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t been studying French .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your turn soon .
I think I should probably go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .

All I care about is the right .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom &apos;s family in Australia .

We all agree with you .
I like summer the best .
When I came home , he was watching TV .
Can you get the piano ?
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That job could well .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you &apos;d talk , right ?
My mother can speak English .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes says things he doesn &apos;t really understand .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining .
It &apos;s not my fault .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always realized this worked .
It will not three minutes .
What color did you answer ?
It was a lot fun .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a for for your mother to your mother .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I needed .
You were busy .
I like both both dogs .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston soon .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you the telephone .
I &apos;m only going to say it to Tom .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do it .
I &apos;ve been to Boston before many .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how it is .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother up from the station .
What other flowers !
I &apos;m mad at both of you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The beginning is over .
I am taking French .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what this is going .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see you , Tom .
What more is this .
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a lot of life .
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What are the plan ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone for a second ?
Is this your fault ?
That doesn &apos;t really good at us .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her only a week ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for Boston .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you don &apos;t know us can do this .
There is a cat on the park .
I can &apos;t believe you just let Tom go .
Tom would like nothing to be alone .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had food enough time .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of books like you like to do ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to come .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a tie ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even know I &apos;ll die .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that anymore .
Tom found the best camera I had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all these days doing here ?
How far is it from here to Boston ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not so cold yesterday .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best we could .
Tom , Mary , John .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do feel good .
Tom asked Mary what he wanted .
He needs no problems to my car .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only time Tom should do .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now can &apos;t walk .
Tom gave Mary everything she needed .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your idea sounds like a good idea .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that again .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is my mother when I &apos;ve got Tom .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very open .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something that you want to say to me ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going home to Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that makes me run .
I don &apos;t want to be eating tonight .
My cat loves its watch .
Is there anything I can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman that I want to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every work in that house is important .
How come you &apos;ve called you before ?
Is it Tom ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my enemy .
I &apos;d ask you if I had known .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the same time happened .
Have you told Tom why they don &apos;t like him ?
I found the news I I .
Tom and Mary sing together .
You &apos;re the first woman .
It &apos;s making Tom nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s no fun fun .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been so tired .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like fun .
Tom has left the city .
It &apos;s not on Tom .
I have no one to turn to .
Who said I say ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
This is not what I was , but was .
How fast were you ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk out of a friend of mine .
This man is very , very happy .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on it .
He said that he had kissed him .
He knew it all along .
The tall man came to the park .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a tie to go with this family .
This book is easy for him to read .
I don &apos;t know what could expect .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This plane &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very mad .
Tom is kind of to go home .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here here ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and opened his heart .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried because fast wasn &apos;t me .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now you remember Tom .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some music to my friends .
My mother has been sick for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was hungry at that .
I want to know exactly what Tom said .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s great is not all any help .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t gotten to John in a long time .
I told you not to help me up .
You &apos;re here here .
Where is the doctor ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Your hands brother finished this time .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been going to Boston .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t do it again .
Why can help you happen ?
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll be busy .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make me the money to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t know who he &apos;s in Boston .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How are rich ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her eyes .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t mind anything Tom did .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your boss .
I usually get home just before 2 : 30 .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the test .
Tom is a friend of my dad .
Tom spoke only the money .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I &apos;d have a lot of milk to play the guitar .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
You can &apos;t believe me .
Tom said that he laughed that .
I don &apos;t know what I would do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The bridge is very small , too fast .
My time is quite that .
How will I find it ?
Go out of the fire .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way , but me know .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What color is two train ?
It would take at least three weeks .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find it .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Our news broke married .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a car yet .
I can read without my glasses .
Our teacher died three years ago .
I think it &apos;s time for me to work .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I blame my friends well .
