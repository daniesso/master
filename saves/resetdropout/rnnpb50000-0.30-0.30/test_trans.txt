Be nice to her .
How come you get so so much ?
There &apos;s something that I want to do .
I can &apos;t hear of for that I want .
I think it &apos;s too difficult to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve finished doing that for Tom .
Is he going to make it ?
That is stop !
Tom and Mary both know how John is doing .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it easy to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy you know the answer .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me he comes on Monday .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you need to spend this longer .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to Tom .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom get into ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t doing that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two books in the kitchen .
He will come in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked Mary .
We &apos;d be happy if you were here .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here here .
You &apos;ve got the right to be happy .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m different .
I know Tom every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything to say ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom drove whatever he says .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my brothers and sisters .
Today at the teacher .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very happy .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it ?
I want to be your lawyer .
Tom looked angry .
The French doesn &apos;t be the good man .
I think they look good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his keys .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her dictionary .
I have never done this before .
The soup is cold .
Tom is sitting in a small house .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows things we do things .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her and her mother .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three minutes .
Tom smiled at Mary &apos;s upset .
You read too much .
All of dogs boy is very beautiful .
Tom said that Mary knows .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem this .
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat less than I could do .
What are you going as ?
There &apos;s very easy on .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was nervous , but he &apos;s all the case .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea better than you .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s probably way to leave .
Are you finished with the paper ?
I forgot to ask your mother .
Tom and Mary get together all day .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it too cold ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do to help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
A dog is that they expected it .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work this car .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He would be able to get married sooner or later .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may go along to your country .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I think .
Tom came to Tom &apos;s friends for me .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much .
I bought a camera while .
That &apos;s another question .
I know your father .
I like one leg .
He is never kissed before .
I have many problems to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here this afternoon .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him from school .
I think Tom will be out .
You were with Tom yesterday , too .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was a bit shy to everyone .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you come to Boston , doesn &apos;t you ?
I am leaving at ten .
What he said was true .
When do I feed the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m still sold this break .
Do you really want me to stay here for a moment ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary came to Boston .
We almost had Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down down ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , do you ?
It looked like Tom want to help .
I &apos;d like telling Tom the question .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston his car .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in Australia with his children .
That &apos;s not my mistake .
That seems sounds left .
You &apos;re really too young .
Tom can help that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve got Tom at home .
I &apos;d like a glass of water .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about to leave ?
I wish I could answer every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would be very proud of you .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t seen John in Boston .
It is home now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying to understand French at all ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How has time a little time ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at that way .
Can you show me the house ?
It was a cold , so I love .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to know this ?
I &apos;ll make it interesting .
There is a big church near our school .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The keys are going to the concert .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been your problem .
I think I understood .
The man is sometimes .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very nice pictures .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you please eat what &apos;s in ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What languages does he make is new ?
I &apos;m not sure if I like this book .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very nervous .
Let &apos;s go somewhere .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom isn &apos;t happy .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many people were there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had not go , I was happy .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not possible .
That was really fun .
A car is faster than a drive .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in the morning .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat has seven off .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who they met .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called her town ago .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom playing with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m no longer here .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How a big team ?
Give us three weeks .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life in this ?
The park is warm .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his age .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all .
I &apos;ll tell you about my father .
The train left place with Tom , too .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t need glasses .
I let the look into them .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really happy that my brother doesn &apos;t like Tom .
Do you want to know more ?
We have to tell a teacher .
Tom wanted to read a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this company Tom ?
Tom plays the piano better than I am .
What does Tom like to do that you don &apos;t like to do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak French better than you speak French .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that ?
Tom and Mary seem to be together in Boston .
You can make your own .
He was so angry he couldn &apos;t speak .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say what happened exactly ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he is in love .
I didn &apos;t arrive by it .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This winter has been up to us .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not looking in this job .
He took angry what he had said nothing .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the old man .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s just what I want to be .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something in this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get to sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who your brother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the truth .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who speak well fast .
Tom thought that Mary would like that .
There is no one in mine .
Tom was afraid to speak French .
That could rain before .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was Mary .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on this .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you play of place ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had to go to the office .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that your face ?
It &apos;s important that you do it .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your name ?
I &apos;d like to meet you in a bad mood .
I &apos;ll drive Mary .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the phone ?
You aren &apos;t like the other choice .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain .
Could I have another beer ?
I love you alone .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry , not you all .
They enjoyed him another hand .
The baby appears to be fast .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two sister .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like both of them .
I wonder if I should answer his question .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened to Tom .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only had it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door .
Can you tell me anything ?
I wish I could remember you .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my car .
Are you still hungry ?
Tom asked Mary if she was doing that with her .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary used to go to the world .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me happy , Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived earlier than usual .
Do you really want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you two doing this ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we have any children and children ?
Tom hasn &apos;t returned yet .
What &apos;re you going to tell me ?
What happens to me isn &apos;t important ?
Tom is good at telling .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I really tell Tom .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school house .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as he is .
If you &apos;d asked me for it , Tom &apos;s still off .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think that was wrong .
We &apos;ve been asked to help you today .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I know .
How did you come up with us ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never been Tom .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said that he saw us .
The teacher did never speak .
You gave Tom to take the money he asked for .
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom is name .
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t written to my advice .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came to cry .
Tom closed his eyes closed .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you for Tom ?
They all look the same .
She did come , but didn &apos;t help me .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this bed ?
We were studying all the time .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can speak to you .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is clean .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll see Tom again .
Tom could do it .
This &apos;s do we do that .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never rather die today .
I found this book .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not like better than I am .
I just wanted to say you .
We have a big team .
How was Christmas today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very small isn .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ll get home .
You just saw them , don &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice are still dead .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good speech .
Where did you leave your car ?
It is going to rain today .
We must do this right now .
Take Tom .
I will take you for a swim .
What a good idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The dogs are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly do you really do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do not like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop the radio .
Don &apos;t say that word that again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I mean in French .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly anything left to eat .
I thought you &apos;d go with Boston .
No matter what you have to do .
We got married very young .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here to do it .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to remember this .
I &apos;d love to meet that .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you to do .
I am ready .
I have two books I need .
Who will take care of the cat ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital yesterday .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s just like his grandfather .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see how you &apos;re doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been studying French ?
It was too easy .
Who see Tom first meet Mary ?
I &apos;m told that Tom has on this mistake .
It doesn &apos;t work .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so .
Your mother are beautiful .
Tom sat under a tree .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re just Tom for three hours .
Can &apos;t that be done ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s going .
She &apos;s a very good friend .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his teacher .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting to me .
How many times did Tom do this ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t like you .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that at school ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you wish .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not too busy .
How many flowers did you go ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t even know what he is doing .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to be angry with it .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom something .
You &apos;re new here , aren &apos;t you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that fast .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like to tell you ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you talk about me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses , does he ?
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t do either .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably came to see Tom again .
Who sent you to dance ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to think .
They were afraid .
She needed to buy something to drink .
How do you know I &apos;m not Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the train .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you so anyone that ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I asked to work .
As soon !
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to love you .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to say anything to himself .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he heard that , she &apos;ll tell the others again .
I think what I need some money where you need .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a bit surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the matter with this ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
A car runs with that .
He did what I wanted to do right away .
You have to begin as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new hat ?
I came here for a vacation .
That way is sad .
Tom didn &apos;t give an explanation .
We weren &apos;t given us today .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be five o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have never had anything else to eat .
It &apos;s not like Tom .
Tom and Mary meet John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked .
It looks great .
When I came home , Tom was writing the book .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that means ?
There isn &apos;t sugar .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That isn &apos;t clear yet .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might learn some questions .
The book is full I thought .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both have very good .
Your French is a good boy .
It isn &apos;t at great .
Take the dog for a walk .
I &apos;ve never been this job .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to live .
I &apos;ve got too much to do at the moment .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid of understand .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat meat every day .
It was not written by him .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book is interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time to finish this .
I know why you came down .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just got the message just .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat seeing Tom .
I do not like this song .
So where he were you .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care about it .
It looks as much as I do .
This might not going to work today .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a child .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I like the way you staying .
What were you doing when I called you ?
Does Tom know how ?
I must get back to work .
The children are full .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You now doesn &apos;t do .

I was waiting at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost every .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s only one book .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s around around here .

We have things to do .
Would you hear coffee or well ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to me .
He is proud of his father .
Tom looked great .
Most college not allowed enough .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and Mary were both students waiting .
How many times do you want to see you here ?
She &apos;s about the same age .
Which one is your ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married when he was in Australia ?
I &apos;ve got a good reason to give you a lot .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .

Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it once .
I don &apos;t want to play this guitar .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people were born in the war .
Tom knew that he would be able to tell us this .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The river he went to not .
I gave him some questions .
I have a head cold .
They know their stuff .
I asked Tom about Mary .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the movies with this .
Look at that .
They stood angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All &apos;s do that for you .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d really appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is six years old .
You don &apos;t need to worry about that .
Are you still mad ?
In Japan , &quot; has he come ?
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my jokes .
Tom asked Mary why she had been here .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t trust anything .

Tom is a very nice apartment .
My mother isn &apos;t home right now .
Tom got on the room .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was where Tom said it .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not a long thing from beginning .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom doesn &apos;t go .
Tom is a very good man .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you .
He didn &apos;t return until it was asleep .
I can stay .

I broke his word .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary &apos;s address .
She was the first girl I was late .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to go out ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this stuff ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .

That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the job .
Tom ate the last piece of cake .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?

Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to answer all the question .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have you been to Boston ?
Tom can hardly talk with his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in nothing else .
I can &apos;t remember what I asked you .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants to do that .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not smoke here .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary like that one .
Can you show me what you have on this dictionary ?
I have have a lot to do that tomorrow .
That isn &apos;t true .
I learned something today .
How come he didn &apos;t show up ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three years older than Mary .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My cat isn &apos;t come either .
They were lucky .
My uncle has a large family .
My parents aren &apos;t home .
I can &apos;t have the courage to buy him this .
He stood up about me .
The man fell on Tom &apos;s bicycle .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me read the book .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .

We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary promised to do .
I don &apos;t know where my umbrella is .
Tom looks pretty bad .

I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to read ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary and so hungry .
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving the moment .
I love you all .
I &apos;m coming to you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for Tom .
Where are they living ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the dog ?
We can &apos;t have you working for his son .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new friends here .
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to remember so well .
Tom got really angry .
I &apos;ve never enjoyed this novel .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to kiss Mary .
Tom seems angry .
It is never by .

That &apos;s not going to happen that .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this box ?
Tom has everything everything .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do this at my office ?
Tom told Mary that I thought I might have to go to Boston .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I came on early .
He knows the concert well .
Tom was loved by Mary that he wants to be here .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will be Canadian .
This book is worth a novel !
We don &apos;t care what he does .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .

Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , can he ?
Tell Tom that I &apos;m swimming .

He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told you that I &apos;m sorry ?

What do you think it says ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .

Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How beautiful is it ?
Thanks to seeing you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never meant to come to come in the office .
I didn &apos;t drink tea yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to have anything to do with our plan .
Tom said he decided not to be with it .
Can you speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is here ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand why Mary hates him .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her name .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you that .
I can &apos;t say anything at this time .
Why do you have never been ?
I should be home home .
We were a bit drunk .

Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .

That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to look ?
Tom , do you have your job ?
I know you &apos;s disappointed in Tom .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat by his way .
That must never happen .
Her family will be able to stay here .
Were you expecting something ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom studied French ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My family didn &apos;t mean it .
I just wanted to show you everything .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re still here .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them all .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that that there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk fast .
I have many friends friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary wanted to do that .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It started last year .
My cat is white .
It makes me waiting .
What country is Boston in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost as big week as usual .
It &apos;s not a secret .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you &apos;ve been English ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all the time .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His father died last week .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s I want to tell you ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without Boston .
Here is coming .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d kept Tom my mind .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of his job .
Tom heard us laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a favor of questions .
I met Tom on the telephone number .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The concert is still warm .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my own ?
I looked at Tom and helped Mary .
Do you like school ?
Tom just died .
My father must have his mother .
Tom has a lot of time .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your telephone ?
Tom gave Mary three years ago .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be hungry .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like doing that money .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people happy this ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will be back .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved Tom .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the train for us .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please come to come and see you .
It &apos;ve never been up a way .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk before .
I guess you won &apos;t win with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly find him .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve got much choice .
Tom , where I are ?
She advised him to laugh .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it you want to do now ?
I gave him a ride .
I think we &apos;re very lonely .
I wish Tom were more like you .
It is difficult to understand this .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and Mary went to Boston together .
How &apos;s your job ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will take place next month .
Tom can &apos;t handle this .
Tom had a knife to us .
We just want to do whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a solution , I &apos;m sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be a teacher .
Come back in .
This table is the same .
Australia is today .
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t help that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s missing .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same place as you had .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you for a little favor .
Tom entered through the piano .
Could you come over this over later ?
Tom is not smart .
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said he loved someone in the party .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the car .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
Bring me the cake , please .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been any pain before .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to go home by herself .
Tom said he thought that Mary might need to do that today .
Tom and Mary are busy together .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read ?
I can &apos;t see why you invited .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said is .
I understand Japanese .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you you need to go to Boston ?
There may be be a mistake .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that Mary .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this building .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m still angry .
I &apos;ll come by bus .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our offer .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who gave me this .
I can &apos;t see you now .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a lot of people .
This coffee is often large .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad by bicycle .
I don &apos;t know what to buy him for his birthday .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about a favor .
I thought they were happy .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well , too .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to visit us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining .
It &apos;s nice to take you , too .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom knows why I needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this car .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a teacher .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America is very big .
My father drinks a cup of coffee every morning .
Tom speaks French much at much .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time with you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to church with Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom impressed ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom never has one .
Tom can swim fast .
Tom and I were really worried about you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , do you ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get some at home .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did what Mary would do .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , may have some time with you ?
Tom is trying by different .
I brought something for you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things of his mind .
Did you give Tom to Mary ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The world is still warm .
I think you &apos;ll be hungry .
I sat next to him .
I slept hours an hour .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary went .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the guitar .
Tom hasn &apos;t been expected with you .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the party .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the same place .
He was saying in the new tie .
Do you know what Tom &apos;ve done for lunch ?
I &apos;d like to take up a week .
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is very cold .
The boy I love me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have you seen you ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at to station .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no time to help you with this .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have come .
He asked me not to open all night .
Isn &apos;t Tom Canadian ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , isn &apos;t he ?
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy looks writing a letter .
Tom needs help now .
How deep ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had helped someone .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the police .
I do that .
You should have nothing left .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in weeks .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to stay .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope it was your mistake .
I think I should probably go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?

All I like is now .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday .
Tom &apos;s family died .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We still agree with you .
I like the world .
When I came home , he was alone .
The sky has changed .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That must go outside .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you would go , but I have ?
My mother can &apos;t speak piano .
Tom has to go to bed early October .
Tom went into Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes seldom does .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining who I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to be .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always knew this once already .
It will happen if soon .
What color do you buy ?

The students like it .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for you .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do you have money ?
Tom refused to give me what I needed .
You were busy .
I finally lost interest sometimes .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston .
I think that won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here in this hotel .
I &apos;m going to have it something to blame .
I &apos;d like a cup of tea .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our best help .
I &apos;ve been to Boston so late .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t care how hard .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother off .
What pretty flowers ?
I &apos;m mad at both of you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking some letters .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what this has has been a good idea .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see Tom !
What hat is on ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything I say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had a lot of fun this .
He tried to sell her for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any money .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life or people .
I don &apos;t think you can help me anymore .
What are the breakfast ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you in a second ?
Is this real ?
That doesn &apos;t really rain with this .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her go .
Tom came .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next plane .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your pencil ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and Mary are talking with John , too .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you are , you can speak French .
There is a cat on the desk .
I can &apos;t believe you right .
Tom would like nothing more than he thought .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had better time .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What old still think I want to tell you ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to try .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get to make that .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s Monday .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find time to do that .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all doing here ?
How far is it always here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
Tom is definitely as well as Mary .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We expected it .
Tom , Mary are French together .
We &apos;ll be friends .
I do feel hot hot .
Tom asked Mary not good at baseball .
He talked a lot to hope .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing Tom did .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now he should come .
Tom gave Mary everything .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your problem ?
Your French sounds like a mistake .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I learned when you got married .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very drive .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to you ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to be with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog named others .
All did you say !
My dog runs three times .
Is there anything we could do ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents love me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who wants to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
Every tie is that he is sick .
How come into Boston you so happy ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what it means .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was angry .
I &apos;d have let you have .
I can &apos;t on this anymore .
This is where the accident happened .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the man I was very hungry .
Tom and Mary often speak French .
You &apos;re the only woman I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s got me .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more than fun of us .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had already worked .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a bad idea .
Tom has left the house .
It &apos;s not not Tom and Tom .
I have no one to turn to .
Who wants to help me ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Ask up for him .
How fast were you ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know where he &apos;s coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three dollars of you .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d give him anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to stay a friend of mine .
This man is very small .
That girl doesn &apos;t work .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that he left kissed him .
He knew it wouldn &apos;t rain .
My TV isn &apos;t out of the house .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a car to do that .
This book is different for children .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This could me &apos;s .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very shy .
Tom is kind of strong .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at Tom .
I think Tom won &apos;t live .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his desk and angry .
These aren &apos;t that you .
I tried again at six .
That &apos;s a table .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a car .
I know people .
Now I feel sad for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been sick .
What do you know about Tom ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has happened .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you want to tell you ?
Tom &apos;s French is full .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t seen from a thing .
I told you Tom was busy .
You &apos;re so longer here .
Where is the pain ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s joke runs away .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been living here .
What time do you usually leave here ?
Are Tom and Mary in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If Tom can help us anymore .
To tell the truth , I was already ?
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the kids here .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t have an apple in this building .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How beautiful ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go back .
Her son has become beautiful .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t stand a chance to worry .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now your mother .
I usually break meeting as soon as I can .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the TV .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the family .
Tom is a friend of my brother &apos;s .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d changed .
I know a lot about it .
I only wish I had one song to sleep .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how good you were .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he thought Mary loved her .
I don &apos;t know what I mean .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows why .
The man is very proud of his .
My train is full .
How could I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t rich .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you going with you ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s right than that .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What &apos;s inside !
It would take at least that one .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I just heard .
Our team forgot the doctor .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read without them .
Our teacher loves her for her age .
I think it &apos;s time for me to take it .
I &apos;d like to have a word with you .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my word .
