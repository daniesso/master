Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s nothing else we want to do .
I can &apos;t think of anything I want .
I think it &apos;s better not to try it .
This isn &apos;t so difficult .
I &apos;ve looked through the door , but I can &apos;t hear him .
Is he going to come to Boston ?
That stop it !
Tom and Mary know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s so easy when you don &apos;t make the rules .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me Mary was sick .
They are proud of their daughter .
It looks like you want to make you a drink .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you .
He looks tired this evening .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom call every day ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t planning to do that .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are a cat outside .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy with us you .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here .
You &apos;ve got the right to be here .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house not !
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom do that .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see anything for it .
Tom is sitting and small .
It suddenly started raining .
I love my plan and sisters .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be be right .
I see your son in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The car boy while I thought was .
I think they &apos;re good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing OK .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to play tennis .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the house .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows that this clock .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would take about three o &apos;clock .
Tom smiled in Mary &apos;s eyes .
You read too much .
All of you swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem there while you don &apos;t see .
Tom took his own face .
I sat less than my boyfriend .
What are you going in ?
There &apos;s very a book left .
Are we going to eat out tonight ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you know the truth .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was ill .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes his family .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now time to leave .
Are you finished with the children ?
I forgot to ask your name .
Tom and Mary understood everything right side .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it always like your family ?
I have to do it myself .
Let &apos;s know what I need to do .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
The policeman raised her son a sofa .
What do you think is going to happen ?
Some of us have to work today .
I have never seen anyone .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not hear so angry .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake I .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your umbrella here .
Tom looked like he was a kid .
Will you give me some time ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
Don &apos;t walk too fast .
Is this for me ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like to see .
Tom came to my lawyer for me .
No one believed his story .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a camera three days ago .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking glasses after day .
He is liked by everybody .
I have many friends to solve .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to meet him after school .
I think Tom will become famous .
You were with Tom yesterday , weren &apos;t you ?
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the situation .
I was able to contact you , but I &apos;m broke .
How are you doing ?
I know this sentence is easy .
When you want to leave you , I &apos;ll be .
I am leaving at ten o &apos;clock .
What I said was true .
When should I feed the dog ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m going to take this train .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary did it .
We almost had Tom .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up !
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re Christmas .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s down there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family living in Boston .
You can &apos;t read French , can you ?
It looked like Tom &apos;s different , but he was younger than .
I &apos;d like him for work .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my family ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a car .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems quite simple .
You &apos;re really pretty .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could travel every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to come .
Tom would &apos;ve been very proud of you .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven now .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s real funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you sure of me here ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How about your weekend ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that at all .
Tom is much taller than you .
Don &apos;t look at me right now .
Can you you see me ?
It was a lot of fun .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I have to speak French ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a new experience .
I promised Tom I &apos;d look after you .
The children are going to the beach today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been to my father .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very nervous .
Do you speak French ?
He wrote to his parents .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you please explain what a thing is ?
I know .
Those are from Tom , aren &apos;t they ?
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What kind of music do you say ?
I &apos;m not sure if that is , Tom .
My father didn &apos;t have a bicycle .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in that .
Let &apos;s go to my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly forgotten .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary are each other friends together together .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known that night .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is a car .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should &apos;ve done something .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer yesterday .
Tom died in October .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat doesn &apos;t play soccer .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody I don &apos;t want to meet you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this isn &apos;t a mistake .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called him with her .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did Tom use with him ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be happy .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet today .
I asked him if he would help me .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them .
You were worried , weren &apos;t you ?
How a big dog !
Give us three days .
You have to do this today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want Tom there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is that so difficult ?
The room is in work .
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his students .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll tell you about my job .
The time is back after ten minutes .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody there .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t owe Tom anymore .
I let the cat into my room .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that &apos;s love .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m really happy that &apos;s my type .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a daughter &apos;s to Europe .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can &apos;t speak English very well .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I should tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can ask me anything to speak .
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You speak French very well .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished here .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of this piece of paper ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together .
You can make your own .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did Tom say exactly ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t eat it .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
This morning has been a very over for a month .
Do you really want to go to Germany ?
We &apos;re not going to be at this than this , do you ?
He took himself what she said .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the door .
I only have two children .
If it &apos;s the right on the table .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he had to get to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my sister is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way she talks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those who know him .
Tom thought that Mary would like John .
There is no clock in the lake .
Tom was afraid to play tennis .
That could take time .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents home ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was trying to use .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Where did you eat ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had nothing to do about the matter .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that my son ?
It &apos;s important that you know .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your last time ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like English ?
Did you see the dog ?
You aren &apos;t like the best kids .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture on the wall .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of milk ?
I &apos;ll be back alone when I &apos;m out .
Tom &apos;s not in the park .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a chair .
Tom seems calm .
Don &apos;t you have me to do this to me ?
They enjoy talking to Tom while .
The baby seems to be interesting .
Give me a piece of advice .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You don &apos;t have to be kind .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like to play soccer .
I wonder if I should bother to travel .
We can &apos;t be sure of what happened .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door open .
Can you tell me anything ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you like you ?
Tom asked Mary if she was happy to love that .
I wonder where he is hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are happy to be .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married .
You knew I was married .
Will it be hot tomorrow ?
Please don &apos;t make me happy with Tom .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later than usual .
Do you want me to leave ?
The dog looks hungry .
Are you the first leave ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we accept where Tom is ?
Tom hasn &apos;t down yet .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
What &apos;s everyone to stop new ?
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should leave .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school very early .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s family .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as good as you think he is .
If you &apos;d asked me for it , I would &apos;ve given it .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t think it was possible .
We &apos;ve been able to do this anymore .
Tell me more .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in trouble now .
Tom was sitting alone on a bench .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom that question .
She lives in New York .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , won &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I &apos;ve told .
How did you come up with such a good idea ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your computer ?
I &apos;ve never forgotten Tom &apos;s computer .
You can &apos;t let Tom win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do that .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
The little girl lived in Japan .
You gave me come to have , didn &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him this morning .
I haven &apos;t ever been to Boston .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a drink .
I didn &apos;t expect this question .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His dream came true .
Tom closed his eyes and walked into the room .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you expecting me for ?
They all look the same .
She did to help you , but I met her .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s mine .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time tomorrow ?
We were studying all afternoon .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about it .
I can &apos;t speak to you anymore .
Tom should run .
Were you home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is our books .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll do it .
Tom could do it if he tried .
This we have happened .
It &apos;s very hot here .
I &apos;ll never ever laugh .
I found this book very difficult .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m Canadian .
I just wanted to say not .
We have a big plan .
How was work today ?
He spent three years in jail .
He will soon become a father .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is very very tall .
I don &apos;t know how to get Tom .
You just saw , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for dinner ?
You &apos;re better than I expected .
Tom , Mary , John and Alice .
I don &apos;t have a computer .
He &apos;ll know the secret he comes .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good price of shoes .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is it , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a little .
I will take you for a swim .
What a nice house !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The cats are in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why do I &apos;d do that ?
I don &apos;t think we need to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop playing tennis .
Don &apos;t say that word again .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do in that .
It hurts .
There &apos;s hardly nothing left to eat .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you do , please do .
We got married very young .
Tom &apos;s only country .
He lost this novel .
You lost , didn &apos;t you ?
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to know you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been able to come home too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the car .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to think about it .
I &apos;d like to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you .
I am ready .
I have enough to read this .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hospital soon .
I &apos;m almost very bad at this .
He &apos;s just like studying .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see if you &apos;re like .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you play the piano .
How many years have you been sick ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom , Tom ?
I &apos;m sure of Tom to class .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to do .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not family .
You don &apos;t have to work so hard .
Your children are healthy .
Tom sat under a sofa .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re coming to take thirty hours .
Can come anything ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always possible .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran with his feelings .
I don &apos;t have enough money to do that .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my friends .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said you didn &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that song ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom still does that as much as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you see .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I &apos;m not home .
How many cars did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom did that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be here ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t go home , I will tell you .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you convince it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re new here , are you ?
The girl went to sleep .
Put out that purpose .
You &apos;re doing it wrong .
You have to come home .
Is there something you want to tell you ?
I wish I was dead .
Can any of you tell Tom ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear a hat yet .
Tom can &apos;t be much older than I am .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t see Tom again .
Who sent you that ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the matter with me .
Tom loves going to the movies .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy .
How do you know I &apos;m Canadian ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia last summer ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you not want to give Tom a piece of water ?
I couldn &apos;t find a car last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to work .
As an accident left closed .
What does Tom see in you ?
I wanted to speak with you about this .
Tom seems like a good person .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to confused .
Tom loves Mary .
Did Tom tell you about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a tie .
These people are my friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When he met his father , he and Mary went to the room .
I think what you need something to eat now .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that .
My parents are both dead .
What is the difference to this , please ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even his name , it is very sweet .
He did what I wanted right away .
You have to be immediately .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you to take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That woman knows where I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an eye .
We weren &apos;t able to help today .
Leave them alone .
Is there anyone in the room ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have never had to speak to Tom .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a key .
Tom and Mary miss John .
Thanks for doing that .
I just can &apos;t stand Tom .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get everything I asked for .
It looks great .
When I heard you play tennis , my son .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that recently ?
There isn &apos;t much much difference .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new bike .
That boy is very mine .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
The book I take was old I was about you .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary have only drink .
Your French is really yours .
It isn &apos;t as interesting as we live .
Take the dog for a walk .
I &apos;ve got this news .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of us .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much work to do .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your problems .
Is your family ?
I &apos;m not afraid of anyone .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not until yesterday .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book sounds interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time to help Tom .
I know why you came here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just lost the best .
You are better than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t have a walk sleep .
I do not like this song .
Have you for him ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let Tom come .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what &apos;ll say of me .
It looks as if it is too .
This is just keep your car .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .
Tom is nothing but a doctor .
I want to talk to you about last night .
I like the way you walk .
What were you doing when I called you yesterday ?
&quot; Where our teacher be .
I must get back to work .
The children are cold .
I watched the movie .
Tom and I have been friends for many years .
She &apos;s beautiful .
You all are right .
Do you want me to give you a hand ?
I feel like him to go with him .
I didn &apos;t like it .
I was young at the time .
She couldn &apos;t come because he was sick .
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary .
Tom said he was busy .
Tom eats out almost now .
Tom was young .
That &apos;s yours .
Tom loves his work .
Was it interesting ?
I know it &apos;s here somewhere .
You have to study harder .
We have things to do .
Would you rather play tennis golf ?
I think that Tom speaks French well .
Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of dying .
Tom looked great .
Most people are rich .
You don &apos;t look very happy .
The cat is under the bed .
I know you want to talk to Tom .
I am injured .
No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .
Tom and I were both talking talking .
How many times could you do this ?
She &apos;s about the same age as my sister .
Which is your new ?
Are we all here ?
I study French at home .
Did he get married soon ?
I &apos;ve got a bad meeting .
I had fun doing that .
You know I love you .
I don &apos;t play golf .
Everyone wants to be loved .
She &apos;ll try it first .
I don &apos;t want to play golf with Tom .
I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .
Tom bought a hat for Mary .
We need that report today .
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of people could travel into the war .
Tom knew that he &apos;ll be able to catch this afternoon .
I think that &apos;s what Tom wants .
The days &apos;s we got to learn .
I read some books last week .
I have a small dog .
They know their feelings .
I asked Tom coming to wait .
He can &apos;t drive .
Were you expecting something else ?
I &apos;m glad you made it .
He laughed for no reason .
I can &apos;t go to the doctor with this .
Isn &apos;t that to be !
They walked angry .
Where can I buy books ?
I know exactly where it is .
I &apos;m not going to do it again .
Tom doesn &apos;t study much .
All we want is to be happy .
I &apos;m already busy .
Tom is angry with me .
I have been waiting for a long time .
I &apos;ve got to know .
Tom was here yesterday .
I &apos;d appreciate it .
Does Tom really have a girlfriend ?
Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?
I &apos;ll make you what you want .
His son is eight years old .
You don &apos;t need to do anything we here .
Are you still mad ?
All the girls are hungry .
They arrived too soon .
Tom likes my parents .
Tom asked Mary why she had done that .
Tom and Mary weren &apos;t over alone .
Tom asked us to wait until .
Tom is a very good friend , isn &apos;t he ?
My mother just call me tomorrow .
Tom goes on work .
Tom fell asleep .
May I speak to you ?
Where does Tom have to do that ?
It was how Tom said it .
I didn &apos;t ask you to wait for me .
How good are they ?
We have nothing .
I like Boston , too .
It &apos;s not that I love .
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks .
Do you feel sorry for Tom ?
Maybe Tom kissed Mary .
Tom is a very good cook .
Tom said that he &apos;d be back soon .
You were very busy , weren &apos;t you ?
He didn &apos;t win .
I can stay .
What did Tom drink ?
I broke his heart .
I agree to your proposal .
Tom waited for Mary .
She was the first girl I was .
When you know , let me know .
Do you want to know how ?
Mary plays the piano .
Why do I need to learn this ?
I love it here .
You like her , don &apos;t you ?
I like what I do .
I &apos;ve never told anyone anything about that .
Both of John .
That &apos;s true .
Tom is always on the children .
Tom ate the last open .
Isn &apos;t that what you want ?
Tom has to save your life .
Let &apos;s not talk about it anymore .
She sat on the bench .
Tom was able to read all the questions .
You said so yourself .
I think you &apos;re very cute .
Tom felt guilty .
How many times have I told you to do that ?
Tom can hardly see without his glasses .
Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it .
Come on , Tom .
Tom seems interested in the room .
I can &apos;t remember what I asked him .
The door wasn &apos;t closed .
No one wants that to happen .
When was it that you first met Tom ?
Please do not believe it .
Tom should &apos;ve helped Mary with her homework .
Can you show me where you &apos;re inside ?
I have not received a long before .
That isn &apos;t necessary .
I learned something today .
How didn &apos;t you show me ?
It &apos;s going to rain .
Tom seems sick .
Tom is three months older than me .
Who told you about me ?
There is no doubt that he is honest .
Tom is away from home .
Tom spoke very well .
My daughter gets far from town .
They were lucky .

My parents aren &apos;t home .
I do you know the address to write yesterday .
He stood up with me .
The man sitting on that bench Tom &apos;s phone .
Don &apos;t be mad at me .
He helped me carry the book .
We &apos;re both very tired .
Do you have a phone ?
This camera is very expensive .
This book is mine .
It &apos;s time for dinner .
&quot; Do you want to go with you ?
Tom plays tennis very well .
We &apos;ve run out of money .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t know what it happened , do you ?
I don &apos;t know where my watch is .
Tom looks pretty bad .
We can &apos;t just fire Tom .
He &apos;s wearing it under his own car .
I &apos;m used to living alone .
Today is my sister &apos;s birthday .
Tom says he &apos;s busy today .
I don &apos;t know how to do this .
Tom will walk .
What kind of books do you like to learn ?
This is fine .
I loved that car .
Tom wanted to kiss Mary even .
Tom lived in Australia for three years ago .
I &apos;m not leaving until you leave .
I love you people .
I &apos;m coming for you .
I don &apos;t remember asking for it .
Where are they happy ?
He gave me his word .
Those are Tom &apos;s , aren &apos;t they ?
Where &apos;s the new girl ?
We can &apos;t get to ask that question .
He plans to buy a new bicycle .
You &apos;re new way !
I know you &apos;re upset .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to hear so well .
Tom got really surprised .
I &apos;ve enjoyed this hat .
That wasn &apos;t my mistake .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to do anything to Boston .
Tom seems angry .
It is the first time I was born .
Tom did it just for fun .
Tom , Mary is able to come next to us .
Who wrote ?
You &apos;re my boss .
I don &apos;t have anything to do right now .
He made for home .
Tom didn &apos;t look like he was tired .
That &apos;s the truth .
He can &apos;t stop us .
I don &apos;t want to talk to you .
Tom will need help .
Who made this cake ?
Tom has everything he needs .
Tom will always be here for you .
She won &apos;t make it .
What do you want to do with this clock ?
Tom told me that he thought Mary might be interested in a place .
I don &apos;t think that Tom was hiding .
Get me the newspaper .
I was married once .
He is as tall as her .
I &apos;m glad that I was able to help you .
He knows the city well .
Tom was advised by Mary to hurt Mary .
You &apos;d better start now .
Tom will likely be here .
This book is quite talking to me again .
We don &apos;t care what he says .
I made that .
My father has been busy .
He talked to himself .
Tom is looking for his parents .
I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t help you .
Let me speak to Tom first .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .
Tom likes them .
Do you like it in Boston ?
Tom can &apos;t speak French , but he must have .
Tell Tom that I &apos;m swimming .
Why am I going ?
I &apos;m afraid I have good news .
Tom was hot .
I was worried .
Tom returned the letter Mary to Mary .
He quit smoking .
Has Tom ever told you how to get to Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t feel much like studying .
Tom is OK .
I was lying .
What do you think it is ?
You could have done it .
Whose bike is this ?
Do your best .
Tom is taking a walk off now .
Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How is Monday with me ?
Thanks to care of you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never meant to make you laugh enough .
I didn &apos;t drink shoes his name .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to know what to do with John .
Tom said he &apos;s too happy to do .
Can breakfast for me ?
Can you tell me why Tom is here ?
We met last week .
I don &apos;t want the money .
I &apos;ll be seeing him again .
Tom couldn &apos;t understand .
I think I need to see a doctor .
I don &apos;t like her face .
Tom is now up .
The dog is in the house .
Where do they live ?
Tom believes everything I say .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
Whose baby is this ?
Take Tom .
I hate my brother .
I &apos;m not going to tell you her .
I can &apos;t say anything in this time .
Why do you guys have one ?
I should be home with my wife .
We were both a bit drunk .
I found the money to help .

I saw them three years ago .
I &apos;d like to buy a shirt .
Tom has been sick in bed for a week .
Tom left town .
I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to sit ?
Tom , do you have this ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must never happen .
Her son will not understood anything .
Were you expecting something different ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom and Mary wonder ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother says to me .
I just wanted to say what to say with you .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you are still here .
I &apos;m proud to be a Canadian .
Let them will come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one there .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have good weather .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to see you .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It all feel in Boston .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What school is happy in ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost as many books as we are .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go next Sunday ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand what .
We do this sentence .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died last year .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color are they ?
How are you feeling ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that of the dog of place ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that without your help .
Here is your dog .
When are you going home ?
I wish I &apos;d give to my advice .
They have few books .
These shoes belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of French .
Tom heard someone laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a person who can speak French .
I spoke to him about it .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that think you want to be ?
Is that man Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The TV is still young .
I do not understand you .

Can I use your telephone ?

Tom said Mary doesn &apos;t do French either .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like right now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people do this ?
The doctor said not try too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never seen as much as much as I am .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting here for a long time .
This is the restaurant who we told you to wait .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be a little drunk .
I want to apologize .
Please remember to come and wait .
It can be make as such a thing .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d never seen Tom drunk .
I guess you won &apos;t go to school with us .
The fire is out .
I can hardly walk .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve heard Tom tried .
Tom , where are we ?
She advised him where he should go .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s time we went to school .
What is it that you want me to do ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re better .
I wish Tom &apos;s fun .
It is difficult to understand this novel .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of milk .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have some .
How &apos;s your job going ?
Tom loved you .
The bus will take place next Sunday .
Tom can &apos;t win with his own on his job .
Tom had a chance to kill Mary .
We just want to know whether Tom is right or not .
We &apos;ll find a key , I &apos;m sure .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never wanted to be in Boston .
Come back in .
This is the same one I want .
&quot; Whose glasses &apos;s Tom &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Tom . &quot;
Tom told me that I shouldn &apos;t buy that .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same story as you could .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you a favor .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you go to me once a look ?
Tom &apos;s parents are sound lucky .
Tom hardly talks to us anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a dog , don &apos;t you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said something in the room .
We know what &apos;s going to happen .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry at all .
Tom has been in the hospital for three months .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , didn &apos;t you ask ?
Bring me yesterday &apos;s paper .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been there somewhere quite 30 .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought that Mary might want to walk home .
Tom said he thought Mary might try to Boston today .
Tom and Mary are getting out of their plan .
I wonder if he &apos;re OK .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to say something ?
I can &apos;t see you why you don &apos;t want to help us .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
Tell me today , Tom .
I care to read a song .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next ?
What do you mean you to do ?
There may be some our great .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do anything for Mary .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this clock .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll be able to help you tomorrow .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to work by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his dog .
Tom is the one who wrote this book .
I can &apos;t see you without thinks .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to go abroad .
This dress is too big for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anything .
Mary is pretty , isn &apos;t she ?
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know what to buy his car .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know more about your country .
I thought they wouldn &apos;t like him .
I couldn &apos;t sleep well last night , well .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save us .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s new to sit .
Who did you go with with ?
I think Tom already knows that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to play in this town .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does you think ?
This isn &apos;t a good apartment for help .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
English is very big .
My father made a walk every day .
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to ask more to you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;m going to break Tom .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him back my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom only has one &apos;s cats .
Tom can swim as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were really happy for you .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s wrong , don &apos;t you ?
This problem is hard to solve .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You get on the table near the beach .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys still doing here ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what he wants to do .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it here ?
Tom , may we speak with us , go ?
Tom is trying to have been ill .
I brought something for you .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has always wanted to do that .
Tom had other things on his desk .
Did you show Tom to it ?
Tom told me that he was lonely .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The boy is too warm .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept tomorrow .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why Tom is doing this .
You can read , can &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m the one with the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be the place .
Tom hasn &apos;t been completely thirty .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can tell the truth from this .

I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I like the house .
He did nothing she watch TV .
Do you know what the bread is eaten ?
Do you want to get married to Tom ?
How long will you be staying with us ?
The soup is quite good .
The boy doesn &apos;t love me .
How often do you wash your hair ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting good at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my parents to worry .
What is the price ?
Tom wanted to know the reason Mary didn &apos;t yet .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you already learn ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting married soon .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that anymore .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at that .
I don &apos;t want to go crazy .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that again .
I have no idea to help you with this .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me whether I had slept well last night .
Isn &apos;t Tom hungry ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very hot .
Tom likes Mary , too .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?

Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy is his hat to my name .
Tom needs help now .
How many years are Tom ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had helped Tom &apos;s umbrella .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the movies .
I do that every week .
You should not speak French .
Tom pretended he was in love with it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in weeks .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to drink so much .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your son &apos;s are lucky .
I think I should go to go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to each other about him .

All I care about is the truth .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom today .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .

We all agree with you .
I like Boston the best .
When I came home from lunch .
The sky has become clear .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother needs me .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up two years ago .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That &apos;s possible yet .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you , but you love .
My mother could speak English .
Tom has to go to bed early .
Tom went to Mary &apos;s office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes seems hard .
You know this .

It &apos;s raining where I am .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I told you this morning .
It will be better than three o &apos;clock .
What time did you buy ?
It was a book .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a ride .
The students needs to study .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a situation for me .
Tom lost his camera in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they have money ?
Tom refused to thank me for what I have .
You were busy .
I like both cats and drinking .
Tom says he &apos;ll go to Boston .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see you here .
I &apos;m only going to do it again .
I &apos;d like a cup of coffee .
Where &apos;s this from ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do it .
I &apos;ve been to Boston long .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t listen to it .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it &apos;s like .
I called my mother off .
What pretty after they dancing ?
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite difficult for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking French next year .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea what the weather is like .
We &apos;re not always right .
When you see you , I &apos;ll understand to you .
What is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun .
He tried to help me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you any questions .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is what to say .
I don &apos;t think Tom can help me anymore .
What are the parents doing ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you alone for a second ?
Is this crazy ?
That doesn &apos;t like your homework !
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her a father ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the next train .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your bag ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for Mary when I sister .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot this morning .
If you are hungry to you five days .
There is a cat on the table .
I can &apos;t believe you just go to bed .
Tom would like a lot to work at all .
We don &apos;t make anything anymore .
You had not waited for three minutes .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of music do you like ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you rich ?
Would you like me to help you ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to give Mary .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever been in a hospital alone ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even know that I first am .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s from Tom .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly find anybody to do that anymore .
Tom found the key to bed .
Tom loved doing that .
What are these people doing here ?
How far is it from here ?
He stayed up late last night .
Tom said it was too big .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not much fish .
Do you have any food ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the watch we could .
Tom , Mary and John played tennis together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do that pretty interesting .
Tom asked Mary that kind of car .
He paid him a few advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the only thing I don &apos;t know .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this again ?
I was worried sick about Tom .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom .
He was interested in me .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things to do .
He always keeps his word .
Now she had three children .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your telephone ?
Your plan sounds like a lot of fun .
I &apos;ve been told that I should do that .
Do you understand what to do ?
I want to drink another beer .
This is what you &apos;ve got my piano number .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on the bench .
Can you complete the work ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very tall .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something to say to you ?
No one is perfect .
I &apos;m going to be married with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that can &apos;t run .
Will you help him the picture ?
My cat likes milk .
Is there anything we can do to help ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents loves me .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the way I want to see you .
Tom will take care of everything .
She noticed in his hat .
How come I ask you tired ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my first choice .
I &apos;d like you know if I had .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is where the weather was .
Have you told Tom why you don &apos;t like him ?
I found the book .
Tom and Mary often sing together .
You &apos;re watching television .
It &apos;s making me nervous .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more like tea .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had very cold .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that here .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a good job .
Tom has left .
It &apos;s not I have to go to Boston .
I have no one to read to advice .
Who said I stole the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Have you ever seen Tom ?
How fast are you driving ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know why to sit to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three of them .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to do anything , you don &apos;t have to .
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk to Tom a dog .
This man is very small .
That girl can &apos;t ride a bicycle .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s father .
Look at Tom &apos;s shoes .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that I should speak French .
He knew it all along .
The tall man came out of the house .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want to do this for a thing .
This book is easy enough to read .
I don &apos;t know what could &apos;ve happened .
I like listening to him .
That &apos;s a good question to ask .
This letter &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s interested now .
Tom is kind enough .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like that .
What are you doing here so early ?
I love you more than her .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and put them on his desk .
These aren &apos;t for you .
I tried again and see you .
That &apos;s a lot .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books .
My mother has been busy for two days .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even look at you .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what to do next to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d be told me ?
Tom could &apos;ve left yet .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t seen him in a house .
I told you you would leave to Boston .
You &apos;re sure by the truth .
Where is the picture ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take your word for it ?
Tom &apos;s old car is out .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been born .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom and Mary in love ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see Tom again .
If happens yourself , Tom &apos;s busy .
To tell you you know I don &apos;t live .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t a lawyer .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the truth .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to hurt .
I don &apos;t have an umbrella .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How come ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go help Mary .
Her son has her .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t finished the truth .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now &apos;s boss .
I usually get home just now .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the game .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me at the station .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to study for the exam .
Tom is a friend of me .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d like .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to play golf guitar .
Tom bought a camera for his son .
I know how busy you &apos;ve .
You can believe me .
Tom said that he heard Mary say that .
I don &apos;t know what I should do today .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The party is very long , so .
My phone is already .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I finished my hair to work .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I say was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s completely taller than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been fired three times .
Is Tom there ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have a moment ?
What time is in ?
It would take all week to do that .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I meant .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I like .
Our team lost the game yesterday .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a doctor yet .
I can read .
Our teacher looks young for its age .
I think it &apos;s time for me .
I &apos;d like to have a good job .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my hair seriously .
