Be nice to her .
How come you know so much ?
There &apos;s something I want to do .
I can &apos;t help anything about you .
I think it &apos;s too important to make it .
This isn &apos;t very difficult .
I regret all out when I &apos;ll find up with you .
Is he going to make it ?
That wasn &apos;t right .
Tom and Mary both know how to swim .
The story is very interesting to me .
I found it difficult to solve the problem .
It &apos;s what you tell me the truth .
I think you can handle it .
Tom told me he was home .
They are proud of this one .
It looks like this music .
Don &apos;t worry about that .
I want an apple .
I wouldn &apos;t do that I could you want to .
He looks tired today .
Did Tom die ?
Give them to me .
Tom wrote to me yesterday .
Did Tom look around ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t doing .
I didn &apos;t know you didn &apos;t know how to swim .
There are two cats sleeping on the bed .
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow .
Tom never asked why .
We &apos;d be happy for us .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
Tom said he would do it again .
Tom didn &apos;t leave .
Tell Tom to get here early .
You &apos;ve got the right to do that .
Would you like to drink anything ?
I have the house long .
Tom would &apos;ve been proud of you .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t tell anybody .
Why can &apos;t I go to Tom &apos;s party ?
He had fun with it .
I &apos;m faster than you .
I know Tom does that every morning .
The park was empty .
Don &apos;t you want to say anything ?
Why can &apos;t you help me ?
Why do you learn English ?
Tom was married to Mary for three years .
I don &apos;t see any reason for it .
Tom sat in front of me .
It suddenly stopped raining .
I love my brothers and death .
Today , I have a lot of homework .
If that happens , I &apos;ll be very pleased .
I see your cat in the garden .
Why are you so disappointed ?
Did you do it by yourself ?
I want to be your boyfriend .
Tom looked angry .
The trip was on the table .
I think they &apos;re good .
Were you sick ?
Tom didn &apos;t actually do anything .
Let &apos;s write a book .
I know how to read French .
The problem isn &apos;t Tom .
She refused his proposal .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you know her ?
Tom and I are doing .
Are you crazy ?
May I try it ?
I just want to hold her hand .
I have never done this before .
The pizza is cold .
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden .
The cat is sleeping on the sofa .
Tom will remember .
I think Tom knows that .
Could you give me some advice ?
She took off her coat .
Tom doesn &apos;t play tennis .
That would be about about three o &apos;clock .
Tom smiled behind Mary behind Mary .
You read too much .
All of them swim very fast .
Tom said that Mary helped you .
Tom wants Mary .
There &apos;s a problem for you !
Tom took his own life .
I usually eat more .
What are you going ?
There &apos;s very little milk .
Are we going to eat out together ?
You don &apos;t want to go there .
I &apos;m glad you do that .
Tom wore glasses .
I hope Tom is in a good mood .
He was late all today .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to do that .
Where will you be on Monday ?
Tom likes tea without sugar .
What do you want to know ?
It &apos;s now on time .
Are you finished with the work ?
I forgot to ask your mother .
Tom and Mary sat together all along .
Do I have to go to Boston ?
Everything is gone .
Is it cold better in Boston ?
I have to do it myself .
Let me know what I can do for help .
Maybe you should ask Tom .
We all know me to me .
What do you think is going to do ?
Some of us have to work this weekend .
I have never seen anyone like him .
Tom says that he &apos;s happy .
He showed interest in the plan .
He could not stand up ill .
I &apos;ve made the same mistake .
Tom didn &apos;t tell me the whole truth .
He seemed to be in a good mood .
Tom seemed to be sure .
You may leave your suitcase here .
Tom looked like he was finished .
Will you give me some money ?
Where did she buy a book ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like Mary .
She plays tennis every morning .
Don &apos;t walk so fast .
Is this your telephone ?
I need to work .
That &apos;s what I like .
Tom came to my face to ask me for money .
No one believed .
I &apos;m learning so much from you .
I bought a camera yesterday .
That &apos;s another matter .
I know your father .
I like drinking beer .
He is saying by everybody .
I have many problems to explain .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s doctor .
What &apos;re we going to do with it ?
Tom is coming here .
Tell Tom he has to do that .
Tom asked Mary to stay at school .
I think Tom will never become a teacher .
You were with Tom when I were with you .
Tom has many cats .
I don &apos;t love Tom .
How much does Tom know about Mary ?
Tom didn &apos;t think you would like the idea .
I was able to contact Tom and Mary .
How are you doing ?
I know this isn &apos;t easy .
When you you come to ?
I am leaving at ten minutes .
What he said was true .
When should I learn the bill ?
I wrote a letter in French .
Tom seemed happy .
We &apos;re close .
I &apos;m also closed this game .
Do you really want to stay here for a week ?
I still don &apos;t understand this .
Tom may want to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary will come .
We almost had Tom convinced .
Tom used to do that a lot .
Please hurry up .
We &apos;ll take what we need .
You &apos;re old .
Tom said that Mary didn &apos;t know how to do that .
How do you go to work ?
What &apos;s out there ?
I am going , too .
Tom and his family live in Boston .
You can &apos;t read anything , can you ?
It looked like Tom is in trouble , but he didn &apos;t want to .
I &apos;d say something for it .
You should have done so .
I &apos;m not going to talk anymore .
Tom went to Boston three months ago .
Could you help me find my dog ?
Tom believed it .
Tom lives in a large house by himself .
That &apos;s not my car .
That seems simple .
You &apos;re really happy , too .
Tom can answer that .
It was very small .
No one saw Tom .
They &apos;ve taken Tom home .
I &apos;d like a glass of beer .
Why wouldn &apos;t you want it ?
I enjoyed it a lot .
What do you like about it ?
I wish I could dance every day .
Tom doesn &apos;t want us to wait .
Tom would &apos;ve been better at it .
Tom and Mary got married in Boston .
It is seven o &apos;clock .
Why are you speaking in French ?
I want to buy a new computer .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so funny .
Tom is still working for us .
Are you saying that Tom can &apos;t understand French ?
I understand that Tom does that .
How about your bus ?
I don &apos;t care what he does .
Tom didn &apos;t know that man at all .
Tom is much taller than you are .
Don &apos;t look at me that way .
Can you show me a car ?
It was a fine day .
We &apos;ll come back later .
Why do I need to dance ?
I &apos;ll make it simple .
There is a big park working very slowly .
I promised Tom I would look after you .
The children are going to the movies today .
I &apos;d rather not go out today .
This has been a big problem .
I think I understood .
The man is old .
Tom is Mary &apos;s uncle .
Tom got very quickly enough to read French .
Do you speak Japanese ?
He wrote to his mother .
Tom refused to go to bed .
Could you put these in your own ?
I know .
Those are are from danger .
I &apos;m not going to do this again .
What people say is what I have ?
I &apos;m not sure if I used to be this one than this is .
My father had me wash the car .
I &apos;m as busy as Tom is .
We were very disappointed in you .
Let &apos;s go back to my office .
We &apos;ll see you there .
Tom is my boy .
Tom was nearly killed himself .
It &apos;s still alive .
Tom and Mary didn &apos;t get along French all this morning .
I was just going to say that .
Tom often goes there by himself .
I know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
You can &apos;t go .
How many of you are there ?
Mary is tall .
Tom knows a lot about animals .
He doesn &apos;t love me .
If I had known you what you want to see you .
Tom seemed lost .
Now that &apos;s not a bad idea .
That was really fun .
A car is from the house .
I never wanted to leave Boston .
Tom should ask a doctor .
I love Christmas .
I played soccer .
Tom died in weeks night .
He &apos;s almost as tall as me .
A cat is five o &apos;clock .
Who was here ?
There &apos;s somebody who loves you .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
I hope this looks like Tom .
She doesn &apos;t need to go there herself .
He called us before ten o &apos;clock .
Tom is very careful .
I have to call Tom .
What did you bring with your dog ?
What are you doing now ?
What &apos;s Tom like ?
They came in .
I don &apos;t know Tom &apos;s brother .
Tom doesn &apos;t know yet .
I think that it &apos;s true .
I still think that Tom will win .
I &apos;m trying to be rich .
I don &apos;t want to study .
Tom walked away .
Tom promised not to tell .
How &apos;s your dad ?
I want to be as rich as Tom .
I play the guitar after school .
The baby was quiet all night .
I asked him if he would come .
May I ask why ?
Don &apos;t ask them where they are going .
You were worried , but I didn &apos;t see you .
How good is Tom ?
Give us three weeks .
You have to do it today .
Tom is lonely .
Do you want me there ?
It &apos;s far from here .
Why is life like this ?
There wasn &apos;t any problems with him !
Why didn &apos;t anyone tell me what to do ?
I must help her .
Tom is very proud of his husband .
I just can &apos;t believe Tom would do that .
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon .
I &apos;ll see you in my library .
The one is coming after all .
Everyone is different .
I remember Tom .
She really wants to go .
There &apos;s nobody here .
We don &apos;t want Tom to go .
I don &apos;t drink beer anymore .
I let the cat written to me when I was young .
She gets up early .
I &apos;m impressed by how well you speak French .
I know that Mary loves me .
That won &apos;t be easy .
I &apos;m lucky that my parents aren &apos;t like .
Do you want to know more ?
We have a son to be married .
Tom wanted to buy a book .
Tom knows Mary is rich .
I &apos;m going to Boston with Tom .
Is this room Tom &apos;s ?
Tom plays the piano better than Mary .
What does Tom like to do that you do ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone .
She can speak English very well .
Tom has no idea who Mary is .
I will tell Tom I &apos;m tired .
I like pizza .
I think you look fine .
Can you do that again ?
I can &apos;t believe Tom is dead .
You can do thank you !
Tom noticed Mary was there .
What do they look like ?
Tom saw someone .
I was already tired .
Tom said he doesn &apos;t think that Mary really wants to do that .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe he can do that .
You can &apos;t tell you what I think .
Do I have to do anything ?
I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;m almost finished doing this .
Get back in the house .
I didn &apos;t see anything .
Do you want kids ?
Tom isn &apos;t going to know .
What &apos;s the name of that book ?
Tom and Mary seem to be so hungry .
You can make your age .
He was so angry .
I &apos;ll ask you once more .
Did you say what happened somewhere ?
I know them all .
Tom hates school .
I was really hungry .
They &apos;re my books .
They are very big .
Tom thinks that he &apos;s in love .
I didn &apos;t sleep until it was too late .
I &apos;m hungry !
She cannot stop us .
I &apos;ve got some work to do .
Can you fix my computer ?
Tom can &apos;t sing .
I drank a glass of milk .
Do you really want to drink ?
We &apos;re not not going out of a walk today .
He refused to buy what he said .
I don &apos;t like this camera .
She helped the man standing across the street .
I only have two children .
If you &apos;re the right , I &apos;s a very good at it .
I can &apos;t leave you here .
You can &apos;t leave Boston today .
Tom wouldn &apos;t do something like some ice cream .
I need something to write with .
Tom knew Mary &apos;s secret .
Tom bought himself a new suit .
Tom sat with Mary .
Tom said that he needed to get some sleep .
Nothing can be done .
We know what we want .
I &apos;ll look after Tom for you .
I don &apos;t know who my mother is .
What are you guys up to ?
Tom can &apos;t come because he &apos;s sick .
I &apos;m not in love with you .
I don &apos;t like the way she speaks to me .
Tom isn &apos;t sure what he should do .
Those town likes him .
Tom thought that Mary would like to talk to John .
There is no clock where Tom lives .
Tom was afraid of his friends .
That could be very cold .
Maybe we should be quiet .
Are your parents alone ?
I didn &apos;t know that Tom was married .
I &apos;m fine .
There was no one on the beach .
I was thinking about what you said .
Which did you eat and fish in English ?
Nobody is doing anything .
He made it clear that he had a knife in him .
How was today ?
Tom smiled at me .
Please let me sleep .
What &apos;s that your glasses ?
It &apos;s important to tell me the truth .
I have to work tomorrow .
How was your name ?
I &apos;d like to meet Tom as soon as possible .
I &apos;ll drive myself .
How could that happen ?
Where are you , Tom ?
Do you like them ?
Did you see the knife ?
You aren &apos;t like the meeting .
Tom hardly ate anything at all .
There is a picture of the question .
It &apos;s going to rain soon .
Could I have another glass of beer ?
I plan to be free of five minutes .
Tom &apos;s not in the office .
Tom thought about this .
I &apos;ll feed the dog .
This house is mine .
Tom sat on a bench .
Tom seems calm .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t buy it .
They enjoy these another company .
The baby appears to be fast .
Give me a day .
Why are you working for Tom ?
You two parents are very busy .
Tom is talking in his sleep .
I &apos;d like to go to France .
I do not like it for them .
I wonder if I could answer his letter .
We can &apos;t be sure of what had happened .
When is Tom coming home ?
Tom was very popular .
I &apos;ve only seen it once .
He worked all day yesterday .
Tom got what he wanted .
I can &apos;t get the door .
Can you tell me anything about this ?
I wish I could remember it .
Where &apos;s your mom ?
Tom found my bike .
Are you speaking French ?
Tom asked Mary if she was willing to do with her new job .
I wonder where he &apos;s hiding .
He is sick .
Tom and Mary are a bad friends .
I know it &apos;s bad .
I know that Tom loves you .
It &apos;s never too late .
Tom and Mary aren &apos;t married to each other .
You knew I was there .
Will it be possible again ?
Please don &apos;t make me do this .
I still haven &apos;t finished .
I arrived later .
Do you really want me to see ?
The dog has gone there .
Are you two coming ?
Tom knows that Mary lied .
I can &apos;t be late .
I &apos;d like to know what I did wrong .
Who did you learn French from ?
Why don &apos;t we stop up and everybody ?
Tom ran away .
What &apos;re you saying , Tom ?
The man isn &apos;t expensive .
Tom is good at telling jokes .
Let me drive you home .
I &apos;m coming to see you tomorrow .
I don &apos;t know if I should tell him .
What does this have to do with my family ?
Tom walked past six o &apos;clock .
The boy began to cry .
Tom got to school just in time .
Tom went in Mary &apos;s place .
What do I do next ?
Tom isn &apos;t as poor as most people think he is .
If you &apos;d asked me for it for you .
Tom said that he didn &apos;t feel like it .
We &apos;ve been very busy to swim today .
Tell me another reason .
We do what we have to .
I know I &apos;m in love now .
Tom was sitting alone on a head .
I never thought Tom would do it .
I &apos;m not going to ask Tom to help Mary .
She lives in London .
Did you tell Tom ?
Tom is going to help us , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m not going to read it .
I found him the book .
She made him rich .
You &apos;re the only one I knew .
How did you come up with such a thing ?
Where do I know you from ?
I wasn &apos;t always happy .
Tom doesn &apos;t know what to do first .
Tom was afraid of Mary .
I &apos;ll stay in Australia for three days .
It won &apos;t work .
Can I use your eyes ?
I &apos;ve never heard Tom &apos;s left .
You can &apos;t let me win .
Tom will meet you there .
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something .
We miss you , too .
Where &apos;s my sister ?
Tom could hardly stand it .
Tom said there &apos;s nothing else we can do .
The couple he finished before .
You gave Tom the money , didn &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t let me die .
I won &apos;t talk to him anymore .
Your name is Tom , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s how Tom does it .
I know you did it on purpose .
She met him there .
I haven &apos;t ever gone to .
Tom went back home .
I &apos;d like to have a coffee .
I didn &apos;t expect this to happen .
I thought Tom was married .
I &apos;m a father .
I just need a little time .
His passport was dead .
Tom fell outside in his life .
Tom still lives with his parents .
Are you asking me for your advice ?
They all look the same .
She did to stay , but didn &apos;t stay long .
It &apos;s time to go back home .
Tom made a decision .
No one &apos;s perfect .
I didn &apos;t drink that milk .
You have to see this .
Where will you be this time ?
We were studying all night .
Tom helped Mary in the garden .
I &apos;m on my own .
We &apos;d like to know more about you .
I can &apos;t understand it .
Tom should run .
Were you from home yesterday ?
Tom asked Mary for money .
Tom is going to help us .
This table is mine .
I &apos;m pretty sure I &apos;ll never see you again .
Tom could do it if you tried .
This won &apos;t do .
It &apos;s very bad here .
I &apos;ll never understand now .
I found this book very interesting .
Are you sure Tom can do that ?
I &apos;m not saying I &apos;m much about Tom .
I just wanted to say thank you .
We have a big dog .
How was work today ?
He spent three years older than Mary .
He will write a man .
Tom showed Mary around the school .
This is a very big fish .
I don &apos;t know how I can do it .
You just saw them , didn &apos;t you ?
Who &apos;s coming for someone else ?
You &apos;re taller than I expected .
Tom and Mary love John .
I don &apos;t have a car .
He &apos;ll be here sooner or later .
Tom made fun of me .
Tom tried to kiss Mary .
I have a good friends to work .
Where did you leave your shoes ?
It is going to rain today , isn &apos;t it ?
We must do this right now .
Take Tom for a swim .
I will take you for a swim .
What a good idea !
Did you see Tom &apos;s face ?
He doesn &apos;t remember me anymore .
The cats &apos;s in the garden .
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn &apos;t do that again .
Why exactly would I do that ?
I don &apos;t think we have to wait for Tom .
I do like Tom .
Let &apos;s stop singing .
Don &apos;t say that without them .
Tom still doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
He wanted to come with us .
I come here every Monday .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing in that situation .
It hurts here .
There &apos;s hardly any room left .
I thought you wanted this job .
No matter what you do , you have to do it .
We got married from Australia .
Tom passed away three years ago .
He lied to my face .
You lost .
He went to bed .
I &apos;m very happy to see you .
You look like your father .
Tom doesn &apos;t like me that much .
I saw you yesterday .
I said I &apos;m fine .
I come from America .
That &apos;s our house .
I &apos;ve been here way too long .
Tom is now on vacation .
Here is the house .
Tom looked quite tired .
I want you to meet this at home .
I &apos;d love to sing for you .
I don &apos;t want to see you anymore .
I am ready .
I have one I need to write .
Who will take care of the baby ?
How was Boston ?
She will leave the hotel soon .
I &apos;m almost finished reading this book .
He &apos;s exactly a bit faster .
I can &apos;t get this suitcase .
I came here to see how you are doing .
Where &apos;s my father ?
I need a new pair of shoes sick .
I never learned to swim .
It &apos;s very difficult .
I want to hear you the man .
How many years have you learned a lot ?
It was too easy .
Who kissed Tom , not he ?
I &apos;m mad for Tom .
It doesn &apos;t work like that .
I &apos;ll do what I have to .
Nobody called Tom .
I &apos;m not guilty .
You don &apos;t have to worry .
Your children look healthy .
Tom sat under a tree , reading a book .
I wish you had come with us .
We &apos;re meeting Tom in three days .
Can &apos;t someone done ?
They &apos;re after me .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s always done .
She &apos;s a very good teacher .
That &apos;s going to take some time .
He ran for his life .
I don &apos;t have enough money to go to Boston with Tom .
I feel cold this morning .
Tom was sitting next to me .
How many times has Tom been here ?
What &apos;ll you do with it ?
I &apos;ve just finished my work .
She met him on the beach .
My father doesn &apos;t understand me .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
I thought you said Tom didn &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t want to do it .
Tom didn &apos;t want to say anything .
Where did you get that picture of me ?
They don &apos;t speak French here .
I &apos;ll sleep on the couch .
Now I get it .
She doesn &apos;t live there any more .
It would be great if you could sing .
Did you like this book ?
I &apos;ll do everything that I can .
We know something about it .
Tom was going to do that .
Tom must do that as often as possible .
Where does he live ?
Tom said something .
Tell me what you say .
Tom didn &apos;t want Mary to leave .
I hope I won &apos;t be too late .
How many cars did you buy ?
I don &apos;t think Tom will do that .
It &apos;s too large .
How long will you be staying in Boston ?
Tom goes to bed early .
If Tom doesn &apos;t get the right to do it .
I &apos;m not too tired .
I forgot to put it on the list .
Why did you sell it ?
Tom closed his eyes .
I only met Tom twice .
You &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
The meeting went to sleep .
Put out that door .
You &apos;re doing it .
You have to come home .
Is there something you &apos;d like ?
I wish I could walk .
Can any of you see me ?
I don &apos;t think we need that .
It isn &apos;t always easy to do that .
Tom needs the money right away .
Where do you want to sit ?
You made me do it .
Tom seemed surprised by the question .
It was just a matter of time .
Tom doesn &apos;t wear glasses .
Tom can &apos;t be rich .
I never felt like doing that .
I don &apos;t drive often .
I always go to school on foot .
I &apos;ll tell Tom the truth .
I probably won &apos;t ever see Tom again .
Who sent you ?
We have to study .
Nothing is the way to handle this .
Tom loves going to Boston .
They were afraid .
She needed some money to buy something to eat .
How do you know ?
Tom may speak French to you .
Were you in Australia ?
I think Tom loves Mary .
We must get back to the ship .
Let &apos;s talk .
I didn &apos;t know Tom .
You should have worked harder .
What makes you think it &apos;s a joke ?
I couldn &apos;t find a taxi last night .
It &apos;s not for you .
I pretended to sleep .
As soon !
What does Tom do in here ?
I wanted to speak with you in the park .
Tom seems like a good mood .
I wonder what happened .
Tom was beginning to old tired .
Tom loves Mary .
Did you tell Tom about Mary ?
It &apos;s no problem .
Don &apos;t forget to wear a car .
These people are good friends .
I no longer live here .
Tom wants to see us again .
When I knew the age into the desk .
I think what you need something is wrong .
Can you do it ?
I am a good boy .
I &apos;m walking with her .
Tom was a little surprised that Mary wasn &apos;t here .
My parents are both the same age .
What is the difference between this and over ?
I &apos;m innocent .
I wouldn &apos;t do it .
Tom got married three weeks ago .
Tom fell off his horse .
I have to go alone .
Even with his eyes and .
He did what I wanted right away .
You have to start as soon as possible .
Tom is doing everything he can .
What do you usually have for breakfast ?
I remember the word .
You promised me you &apos;d take care of Tom .
Do you like my new shirt ?
I came here for a vacation .
That woman knows I live .
Tom didn &apos;t give an answer .
We weren &apos;t ever done today .
Leave them alone .
Is there anything in the box ?
It &apos;ll soon be three o &apos;clock .
I play piano .
I have not anything to say anything to eat .
It &apos;s possible Tom doesn &apos;t have a choice .
Tom and Mary miss Mary .
Thanks for doing this .
I just can &apos;t stand you .
Who are they ?
He didn &apos;t tell the truth .
I won &apos;t get better without myself .
It looks great .
When I came home , reading the paper .
Tom walked through the door .
Tom was very disappointed .
Tom talked about school .
What &apos;s in that cost ?
There isn &apos;t possible about the others .
I really should &apos;ve helped Tom .
He started a new life .
That movie is very true .
Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years .
Tom said he thought Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday .
This book is very small .
Can you come to Boston tomorrow ?
Tom and Mary both got very little .
Your French is good .
It gets very expensive .
Take the dog for a walk .
I &apos;ve got this good news .
Where &apos;s Tom working now ?
Tom helped himself .
I went shopping with a friend .
Do you think Tom likes me ?
You are one of you .
There &apos;s no reason to get angry .
You &apos;re probably doing it wrong .
I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t want to study French .
I &apos;ve got much much to finish all the time .
Do you think Tom is happy ?
I wish I had your friends .
Is your family OK ?
I &apos;m not afraid .
I &apos;m getting tired of it .
That made me change my mind .
This is our only hope .
Don &apos;t you feel like going to the movies ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat rice every day .
It was not until I say this book .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
This book seemed interesting .
There &apos;s no need to be afraid .
It &apos;ll take a long time for me to finish this .
I know why you came down here .
I don &apos;t understand Tom sometimes .
I &apos;ve just heard the news right now .
You are older than me .
Tom was sitting on the couch alone .
I couldn &apos;t eat meat when I was a child .
I do not like this song .
So where were you ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .
Let &apos;s go .
I think Tom was looking for you .
Tom took the money .
I don &apos;t care what has become of him .
It looks as Tom is the teacher .
This is just the problem with Tom .
What are your plans for tomorrow ?
He was wrong .
I &apos;m not mad at you anymore .
We don &apos;t want you here .
I think Tom &apos;s here .
It is Monday today .
I know nothing about it .

Thank you for coming to see me .
He is proud of being a mistake .
Tom looked great .
Most students students .
You don &apos;t look very happy .

No one believes that anymore .
I cannot decide whether to go or not .
I love cake .

I want to see this .
Tom ran to catch the train .

We need that report by myself .
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does .
I don &apos;t think you should tell Tom the truth .
A lot of problems is in the room .

Do you want me to ask Tom ?
Will you wait a moment ?

Tom wouldn &apos;t have done it that way .
Come on , Tom &apos;s .

Where &apos;s the new love ?
We can &apos;t have you waiting for us .

I &apos;m glad I first met you yesterday .
He knows the stuff Mary has .
Tom was asked by Mary to go there by herself .

My father has been busy .
He talked about himself .

Let me speak to Tom .
How long were you there ?
Please don &apos;t go .

Tom said you might be able to help .
Tom never showed up .
I won &apos;t see you again .
How old is it ?
Thanks for you .
I still have them .
I can &apos;t wait any more .
I got Tom to buy it for me .
I never meant to be you in any danger .
I didn &apos;t kill her name yesterday .
Tom doesn &apos;t seem to have anything to do with me .

Can anybody speak French ?
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that ?
We met last week .

I want to see what happens .
Thank you for seeing me .
Come out with us .
Tom played the piano .
That &apos;s my answer .
Where would you like to see me ?
Tom , do you have a problem ?
I know you &apos;re disappointed in me .
Tom is going to take care of everything .
Tom sat behind his desk .
That must not happen .
Her son will succeed .
Were you expecting something wrong ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
We just have to work very hard .
I was there .
How long have Tom been at all ?
I don &apos;t think they like me .
My mother always wanted him to be so late .
I just wanted to thank you for your help .
Those are my sister &apos;s books .
I &apos;m glad you are still wrong .
I &apos;m proud to be a child .
Let them all come .
Tom , I want you to have this .
They sat on a bench in the park .
Take that one .
It doesn &apos;t look like Tom is very happy .
Let &apos;s talk soon .
I have several other friends .
Tom has never been sick .
Tom didn &apos;t know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with Mary .
I &apos;ve got a plan .
The baby is fast asleep .
The car is ready .
It &apos;s rain in a week .
My cat is white .
It makes me nervous .
What country is that in Boston ?
Why are you guys here ?
They &apos;re almost three years older than you .
It &apos;s not a dream .
This bird can fly .
What do you want to do when you grow up ?
That won &apos;t change anything .
I think Tom doesn &apos;t remember me .
I &apos;m sure Tom was happy .
Try to understand me .
How beautiful !
I don &apos;t want to hear another word .
Where would you like to go to school with us ?
Tom is the one who doesn &apos;t understand .
We do this all thing in the world .
What &apos;ll you eat ?
I think Tom will win .
I need somebody to talk to .
Can somebody help me ?
His son died .
You may go there .
When &apos;s Tom going to eat ?
Tom &apos;s got nothing to lose .
What color they are ?
How do you guys ?
Tom brought a gift for Mary .
What &apos;s that right called ?
You &apos;d better leave .
Please don &apos;t tell your parents this .
Did you vote yet ?
Tom could &apos;ve done that .
Here is your school .
When are you going home ?
I wish you could hurt up your feelings .
They have only one .
These shoes are belong to Tom .
I &apos;m sick of Japan .
Tom heard someone laughing .
Her father is Japanese .
His life is in danger .
I was able to swim across the river .
Tom never wants to see Mary again .
I want a name .
I spoke to him about the matter .
You &apos;re old enough to understand .
What does that look like to you ?
Is that Tom ?
I don &apos;t like doing this .
We were all tired .
The baby is still young .
I do not understand you .
Did you use my seat ?
I looked at Tom and laughed .
Do you like school ?

My father drives old .
Tom has a lot of money .
Where should we go ?
Who wrote these flowers ?
Don &apos;t eat too much .
Can I use your help ?
Tom gave Mary thirty dollars .
Could you give me a ride ?
I &apos;ll never understand you .
I don &apos;t like this book .
Tom said that Mary would be willing to help us do .
Tom used to do that .
Tom is studying in Boston .
I don &apos;t feel like eating right now .
Tom and Mary are my friends .
She can &apos;t live without him .
Why do people want to go there ?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much .
I haven &apos;t said anything .
The man ran away .
Tom will never listen to Mary .
I have lost the key .
Please be quiet .
We need to decide today .
Do you want to work here ?
I like to go to the movies .
I missed the bus .
Don &apos;t you want to help them ?
I &apos;ve never loved anyone as much as I used to .
Tom loves children .
Tom isn &apos;t with Mary .
Tom has been waiting for a long time .
This is the end of which year .
I knew this was going to happen .
Tom seemed to be drunk .
I want to apologize .
They remember to know where it is today .
It can be be having a chance .
Is Tom still in Australia ?
Who called me ?
Tom and Mary don &apos;t want us here .
I &apos;d just seen Tom drunk before .
I guess you won &apos;t be eating of us .
The fire is out .
I can &apos;t walk .
I don &apos;t think I can do that .
Tom , where are these ?
She advised him if he should go .
I drank coffee .
Give Tom whatever he wants .
It &apos;s about time you went to school .
What is it that you want me to do now ?
I gave him a call .
I think we &apos;re almost done .
I wish Tom were more like you .
It is difficult to understand this novel .
Tom doesn &apos;t need to worry about Mary .
There was a lot of snow .
Tom was speaking to Mary .
Tom and I have something to do .
How &apos;s your dad going ?
Tom loved you .
The meeting will be closed today .
Tom can &apos;t handle this job on his own .
Tom had a chance to apologize .
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not .
We &apos;ll find a place .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in months .
Tom is often late for work .
I &apos;ve never been in Boston before .
Come back in .
This table is as big as that one .
&quot; Who else ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a student . &quot;
Tom told me that I didn &apos;t read French .
Tom never changed .
It &apos;s now now .
What were you doing down there ?
I have the same dictionary as you had .
Thanks for asking me .
I need to ask you a favor .
Tom entered through the window .
Could you come to the office if you have a moment ?
Tom &apos;s strong number .
Tom hardly ever speaks French anymore .
I just did that this morning .
Where did Tom see you ?
You have a family , do you ?
I would like something to drink .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
Why would someone else do that ?
I met Tom .
Did you really say that ?
How was it ?
Tom said that he and Mary left in Boston together .
We know what &apos;s going on today .
You need to stop smoking .
I &apos;m not hungry yet .
Tom has been in the hospital for a few days .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
At first , I was happy .
Bring me over this and Tom .
What &apos;ve you got ?
I &apos;ve never been talking about speaking with what happened .
Tom didn &apos;t agree .
Tom said that he thought Mary might liked to cry .
Tom said he thought Mary might needed to do that today .
Tom and Mary are proud of their son .
I wonder if he loves me .
We want to speak with Tom .
Why do you need to read some books ?
I can &apos;t see why you &apos;re here .
I want to speak French .
Do I have to open the window ?
He said he was place , please .
I understand Japanese as well as Tom .
She wasn &apos;t helping her mother .
What &apos;re you going to do next summer ?
What do you mean to Tom ?
There may be again in your accident .
I &apos;ve never told anyone that before .
Tom can do that without my help .
Please do something about it .
You don &apos;t belong here .
Tom is somewhere in this town .
She isn &apos;t alone anymore .
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be back now .
I &apos;ll come by car .
Why are you asking me about this ?
He turned down our proposal .
Do you do that often ?
Tom goes to school by bus .
Yesterday was Monday .
Tom played with his family .
Tom is the one who speaks French French .
I can &apos;t see you without thinking of your mother .
I &apos;m going to stay here for several days .
Tom can &apos;t afford to buy a car .
This dress is much too large for me .
Tom knows what you &apos;re thinking .
Tom hardly ate anymore .
Mary is pretty .
I will go abroad next year .
I don &apos;t know how to write a letter .
Tom has what Mary wants .
I want to know where your problems is .
I thought you wouldn &apos;t like you .
I couldn &apos;t quit well better , so I can &apos;t remember her .
What else can I do to help ?
Tom will come to save them .
I do what I want .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again .
It &apos;s be there and can &apos;t tell each other now .
Who did you go there with ?
I think Tom already knew why Mary needed to do that .
May I talk to you ?
People don &apos;t know how to drive in this morning .
Tom believed that Mary was innocent .
I don &apos;t go to school by bus .
What exactly does that mean ?
This isn &apos;t a good teacher .
I &apos;ll be busy next week .
We don &apos;t know why .
America slept very hard .
My father asked me where she lived .
Tom speaks French as well as I do .
He &apos;s probably sleeping .
I &apos;d like to have more time to talk about you .
Tom knows how to do that .
I think I &apos;ll be back on Monday .
Tom will find you .
Was Tom angry ?
I had him fix my watch .
Do you want to see a picture of Tom ?
Tom must &apos;ve read everything .
Tom can swim faster as fast as Mary .
Tom and I were pretty lucky .
Could you do me a favor ?
You know that &apos;s right , right ?
This problem is hard to do .
How was the game ?
How did you sleep last night ?
You never asked Tom what was the problem .
I had fun doing this .
What are you guys going out ?
I want to know what this is .
You don &apos;t really want to do this , do you ?
Would you mind if I have a look ?
I &apos;ve always loved you .
Tom doesn &apos;t work as hard as he used to .
Tom &apos;s not hungry .
She came to see me .
Tom doesn &apos;t like coffee .
Tom did about not about everything in the little boys .
Come with me , please .
I &apos;m not coming home .
I think we &apos;ll be fine .
How deep is it ?
Could I sit down with your passport , please ?
Tom is trying to get back from here .
I brought that my mother .
Tom seems ready .
Tom has been very rich .
Tom had other things on his mind .
Did you put Tom up to you ?
Tom told me that he was hungry .
Do you think Tom will be early ?
The letter is still too expensive .
I think you &apos;ll be impressed .
I sat next to him .
I slept tomorrow .
Tom is much younger than Mary thinks .
I want to know why this is possible .
You can only see .
I &apos;m the one of the car .
Tom doesn &apos;t know when Mary can come .
Tom had some questions .
Tom pretended to be dead .
This must be great .
Tom hasn &apos;t been afraid of things .
Tom came by .
These are the rules .
Tom arrived earlier than usual .
I don &apos;t know Tom that well yet .
They &apos;ll find us .
I need to ask you some questions .
You can see the name from Tom .
It &apos;s too cold .
I &apos;m glad I listened to you .
I found the room .
He did nothing but take the new hat .
Do you know what Tom heard for breakfast ?
Do you want to wait here ?
How long will you be staying with me ?
The soup is so hot .
The boy I love Tom .
How often do you eat ?
They &apos;re afraid of us .
Tom is getting better at that .
It will stop raining soon .
I don &apos;t want my mother .
What is the price of Tom ?
Tom wanted to be alone .
That &apos;s not what you want to do .
Tom said he wouldn &apos;t do it again .
Have both of you already decided ?
Tom can do it .
She worked hard .
Let &apos;s do our best .
Tom is getting bored .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done that without your help .
You &apos;d better go home as soon as possible .
I won &apos;t go shopping .
I came at home .
I did it &apos;s over .
Tom said that he doesn &apos;t think that Mary will do that .
I have no time to help you with the work .
Perhaps you &apos;d better leave .
I don &apos;t have any sisters .
He asked me whether I had slept well last night .
Isn &apos;t Tom great ?
You don &apos;t know , do you ?
This tea is very big .
Tom likes Mary and so wouldn &apos;t do that .
What &apos;s Tom going to do for us ?
Tom isn &apos;t ready yet .
He is short , but he is strong .
Tom &apos;s very sad .
The boy playing the piano is my younger sister .
Tom needs help .
How when you think Tom is right ?
When does Tom want me to be there ?
When should we come to Boston ?
I &apos;m a little busy .
Tom has been in Boston for a week .
I wish you had loved Tom .
That &apos;s what I told him .
I went to the post office .
I do that every day .
You should not speak quickly .
Tom pretended he knew nothing about it .
Let me be .
I haven &apos;t been outside in years .
We were just going .
Tom didn &apos;t used to read French .
How am I going to get home ?
That &apos;s what Tom said .
Where did Tom learn that ?
I &apos;ll take it .
I hope your French not Tom .
I think I should probably go .
Tom isn &apos;t going to make it .
Tom is out here .
It &apos;s bad for you .
We &apos;re learning French .
How &apos;s your father ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anyone in the house .
Maybe Tom is stupid .
Tom made me eat it .
He will be a good teacher .
Tom can &apos;t stop Mary .
Tom is writing a book .
Nobody was home .
Did Tom go ?
He has been sick for a week .
I want to talk to him about it .
I want a dog .
Tom &apos;s studying .
All I care about is the case .
Let &apos;s do the work .
I helped Tom yesterday morning .
Tom &apos;s family lives in Boston .
I saw her home .
Tom has been dead for three years .
We all agree with you .
I go to the beach .
When I came home , he was sick .
The sky &apos;s very clean .
Someone made a mistake .
My mother made me study .
Tom has two cats .
He gave up smoking .
Tom didn &apos;t know .
What have you eaten ?
That love us well .
I found this restaurant by chance .
Tom made that himself .
I thought you were all , would true .
My mother could speak five languages .
Tom has to go to bed early tonight .
Tom went into the office .
I don &apos;t want that one .
Tom sometimes doesn &apos;t understand .
You know this .
I &apos;ll give Tom that .
It &apos;s raining where I was .
It &apos;s not my business .
Tom is playing soccer .
This was not supposed to happen .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
I always had this problem .
It will not stay in more than three minutes .
What color does Tom do ?
It was a beautiful time .
He doesn &apos;t know how to ride a car .
The students like you .
Tom says he doesn &apos;t like doing that .
Here &apos;s a book for you to read .
Tom lost his umbrella in Boston .
Tom couldn &apos;t swim .
I could have helped .
Do they children ?
Tom refused to open what I asked for .
You were busy .
I like cats books .
Tom says he &apos;s happy .
I think that she won &apos;t come .
Tom didn &apos;t get the job .
I &apos;m going to go with you .
Why do you believe Tom ?
It &apos;s not true anymore .
I need to go to the hospital .
We &apos;re alone .
Tom appears OK .
Where do you work ?
Tom did that on purpose .
I am surprised to see this at this .
I &apos;m still going to talk to you about anything .
I &apos;d like a glass of wine .
Where &apos;s this ?
They might be taller than you .
We prefer to do our homework .
I &apos;ve been to Boston as often as he comes .
I know that you know .
I don &apos;t feel strong .
Tom may do that for you .
I know what it means .
I called my mother hiding from the station .
What much books are you ?
I &apos;m mad at you .
This is quite easy for Tom .
They cannot stop us .
That &apos;s not for me to say .
Why can &apos;t we just leave right now ?
The game is over .
I am taking Japan to the movie .
Tom is big .
What is it you want me to do ?
I have no idea how deep the weather will be .
We &apos;re not Tom , are you ?
When you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll understand .
What soon is this ?
Tom gave me some good advice .
He believes everything that I say .
You should eat vegetables .
We had so much fun together .
He tried to blame me for everything .
I &apos;m not going to give you a chance .
Tom will be back by 2 : 30 .
I &apos;ve lost .
Please listen to us .
We &apos;ll call Tom .
It is a matter of life !
I don &apos;t think anybody can help me anymore .
What time are the people ?
Tom ate quickly .
Could I talk to you for a second ?
Is this true ?
That doesn &apos;t really help all of us .
Everyone makes mistakes .
Tom wanted to know where it happened .
What &apos;s wrong with your eyes ?
I saw her three years ago .
Tom came in .
I felt sorry for Tom .
It is not my day .
I have to change it .
Don &apos;t open this box .
Tom was definitely busy .
He may be on the bench .
Tom bought a book .
Did you remember to go to the library ?
Which is your explanation ?
I need to stop thinking about Tom .
You have to go to the party .
I &apos;ll call you in a week .
Tom and I are waiting for him , but he loves me .
That &apos;s very interesting .
It &apos;s pretty hot today .
If you are hungry , you can play the piano .
There is a cat on the chair .
I can &apos;t believe you just found it .
Tom would like what he told what to do right now .
We don &apos;t expect anything anymore .
You were beginning old night .
These are yours , aren &apos;t they ?
What kind of music is a new idea ?
Tom didn &apos;t intend to hurt Mary .
Aren &apos;t you your girlfriend ?
Would you like me to help you do that ?
There isn &apos;t anyone in there .
Tom refused to open .
Tom is going to miss you .
Have you ever eaten in a foreign country ?
How much do you want ?
We didn &apos;t even get that far .
I am totally confused .
It &apos;s morning .
I &apos;d like to thank you .
I can hardly see Tom .
Tom found the key he had been looking for .
Tom loved doing that .
What are all kids doing here ?
How far is it from here to the station ?
He stayed up late .
Tom said it was too cold .
Are you able to swim ?
It &apos;s not sad yesterday .
Do you have any idea ?
Tom &apos;ll quit .
We helped Tom the best things we were .
Tom , Mary and John left all together .
We &apos;ll be friends forever .
I do feel good .
Tom asked Mary what kind of music .
He kept me waiting for his advice .
Tom has more money than I do .
That was the right answer .
We had fun with them .
Can we try this later ?
I was worried about Tom about it .
He wants to marry my daughter .
I &apos;m just as busy as Tom is .
He was interested .
Do you know who she is ?
Tom had a lot of things .
He always keeps his word .
Now they speak French .
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted .
I hope that he will help me .
He came back soon .
May I use your help ?
Your idea sounds like a good story .
I &apos;ve been told to do that .
Do you understand what you have to do ?
I want to drink some water .
This is what I &apos;ve finished .
Don &apos;t you want to go with Tom ?
You &apos;re big .
Why is Tom doing this ?
Don &apos;t put it on my desk .
Can you remember the first time Tom left here ?
I knew who he was .
Tom is very open .
You do want that , don &apos;t you ?
Do you have something that you want to say ?
No one is running .
I &apos;m going to be home with Tom .
Was Tom there ?
It was a big mistake .
I have a dog that can run .
English is not living in the hospital .
My sister loves coffee .
Is there anything we can do ?
I know what I know .
I &apos;ll do it for you .
My parents are scared .
Tom goes to school by bicycle .
That &apos;s the woman who did you ?
Tom will take care of everything .
We believe that he will help .
How did I get back here ?
Is it Tom &apos;s ?
He doesn &apos;t understand what you say .
Where &apos;s Boston ?
They didn &apos;t even know what to do .
Tom really was my mother .
I &apos;d have let you &apos;ve asked me .
I can &apos;t deal with this now .
This is meant again .
Have you told Tom about you ?
I found the man who &apos;s looking .
Tom and Mary sometimes sing together .
You &apos;re the first person I &apos;ve ever loved .
It &apos;s impossible for me .
I &apos;ll come with Tom .
It &apos;s more fun of sleep .
Tom didn &apos;t know that Mary had been sick .
I heard Tom was in Australia .
Tom likes doing that .
I can &apos;t visit you every day .
What did Tom actually do ?
We should be very careful .
I think you &apos;d like that .
It sounds like a dream .
Tom has trouble .
It &apos;s not take Tom to make that what happened .
I have no one to turn to one .
Who said you stole the money ?
They look busy .
What is she like ?
Everybody &apos;s here .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
Tom opened Mary at the hospital .
How fast were you sitting ?
It looks like Tom is fine .
Do you know if you &apos;re coming to the party ?
Tom is coming to the party , too .
Tom has three mistakes .
I think Tom should stay .
I &apos;d do almost anything for you .
If you don &apos;t want to say anything , don &apos;t you ?
Tom has to go see Mary .
I tried to talk out like a friend of mine .
This man is very different .
That girl can &apos;t swim a lot .
I love it !
Tom has been there for three years .
Tom wanted to see Mary &apos;s room .
Look at Tom &apos;s family .
He walked across the street .
Do you know about this ?
How old are the kids ?
We didn &apos;t stand a chance .
It is on me .
He said that you &apos;ve met him .
He knew it all along .
The man sitting out of the house .
I know what Tom is thinking .
I want a lawyer .
This book is easy enough for them to read .
I don &apos;t know what happened .
I like talking to him .
That &apos;s a good question .
This book &apos;s for me .
I &apos;d better take a look at it .
Does Tom have one ?
You don &apos;t need to hurry .
Don &apos;t ask me to do this .
He &apos;s very happy .
Tom is kind to talk to Mary .
You &apos;re too late .
I can &apos;t play tennis .
I &apos;m surprised at myself .
I think Tom looks like John .
What are you doing here ?
I love you more than anyone .
I don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
Tom lives in Boston , too .
This book was very interesting .
Tom took off his glasses and milk in his pocket .
These aren &apos;t about you .
I tried again right and nothing .
That &apos;s a small watch .
How is this possible ?
Are you here to see Tom ?
I don &apos;t have a dog .
I know people .
Now I feel sorry for her .
Tom said Mary was very tired .
Be careful .
I brought some of my books to read .
My mother has been sick for breakfast .
What do you know about him ?
I can &apos;t even remember why you &apos;re here .
I &apos;ll do that for you .
No one knew that .
No one knows what has become of her .
Tom was great at that .
I want to know what you said to Tom .
I &apos;d like to know for sure .
It &apos;s not what we want .
Is there anything you &apos;d like to tell me ?
Tom &apos;s well &apos;s all here .
Tom and Mary haven &apos;t heard in John in John .
I told you Tom to help us yourself .
You &apos;re happy at the moment .
Who is a very good mood ?
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Can I take it on your own ?
I invited him while this book .
I was sleeping .
Tom wants me to come to Boston .
I wish I &apos;d been born there .
What time do you usually leave home ?
Are Tom in Boston ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I won &apos;t see that anymore .
If anybody can help us , it &apos;s Tom .
To tell you the truth , I don &apos;t like Tom .
Tom looks like he &apos;s fine .
Tom knows I &apos;ll call you .
Tom isn &apos;t doing a bit .
That &apos;s what I said .
Make the time to do it .
When do we want it ?
I don &apos;t agree with him .
Did you guys see that ?
I just don &apos;t want Tom to get hurt .
I don &apos;t know you that in mine .
They &apos;re listening .
Do you like me ?
I could give it a try .
Tom saw it , too .
How come they are ?
I &apos;d like for you to go .
Tom should go home .
Her name has her .
Tom could &apos;ve changed .
Tom put on some clothes .
You don &apos;t hurt up enough .
English is difficult to learn .
You must go to bed now .
I was at home .
His book is very interesting .
I &apos;m now on your way .
I usually get home before now .
That sounds like a lot of work .
It &apos;s on the sofa .
We &apos;re fine .
Tom &apos;s right .
Please wait for me a moment .
Isn &apos;t that great ?
I &apos;m not saying it &apos;s impossible .
I don &apos;t want to work there anymore .
You should &apos;ve stayed in Boston .
I have to stay for the bank .
Tom is a friend of my job &apos;s now .
Tom spoke only French .
I thought you &apos;d change .
I know a lot about it .
I only know how to cook about it .
Tom bought a present for his son .
I know how busy you &apos;ve been .
You can believe what I mean .
Tom said that he heard Mary .
I don &apos;t know what I do without you .
What could I say ?
Tom has more questions .
He is taller than his brother .
They already got married .
I don &apos;t think Tom knows that .
The river is very small , but he is .
My phone isn &apos;t about .
How will I find it ?
Go out and play .
We &apos;ll talk later .
I paid good money for this .
He doesn &apos;t have enough experience .
Tom wasn &apos;t famous .
Everything I said was true .
Tom told us .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
I have to know if it &apos;s true .
I was too shy .
They &apos;re coming .
Are you always busy ?
I have something for you to do .
He felt at home .
She &apos;s way faster than me .
Tom never asked me .
That &apos;s what I want to ask .
Tom is my boss .
I wonder how Tom does that .
Tom has been dead three times .
Is Tom your friend ?
They &apos;re already here .
Do you have any more ?
What a beautiful place !
It would take better for you .
Don &apos;t let go .
I must find work .
Thanks for all your help .
You must tell Tom the truth .
I know why you &apos;re not happy .
I really meant what I said .
Tom isn &apos;t my brother .
That &apos;s not what I feel like .
Our parents were going to hurt Tom .
That &apos;s my lunch .
I think we need more water .
I haven &apos;t found a decision yet .
I can read without glasses .
Our teacher looks young for her age .
I think you might do it for a minute .
I &apos;d like to have a little talk .
Tom found it .
You &apos;re safe now .
Tom was in the room .
I take my letters after you .
